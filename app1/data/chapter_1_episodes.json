    "content": "The most precious scripture, Srimad Bhagavad Gita, was presented to the world through Bharath (India). It is the quintessence of Mahabharatha. It is a wonderful upadesa (divine message) delivered by Sri Krishna. All Elders, the wise, established that the very purpose of God's incarnation as Sri Krishna was to deliver Bhagavad Gita. He delivered the Bhagavad Gita, Himself, and decided to be accessible to the world in the form of this teaching. This teaching reveals a clear path for everyone. It provides an appropriate solution to any difficulty one might face. This is the reason He wanted to give Bhagavad Gita to everyone. This was the reason He incarnated as Sri Krishna. The very reason He revealed His divine form as Sri Krishna avatara (incarnation) was to establish His capability in delivering this incredible message. He was born in a prison. He was born to Devaki and Vasudeva. He showed His astonishing form as Sri Krishna right at birth.\n\nSage Parasara says...\nSANSKRIT WORD = tam adbutam ba:lakam ambuje:kshanam\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = a child, yet so astounding, never had this kind of child been seen before\n\nHe appeared with four hands, holding the weapons Sankha (divine conch), and Chakra (divine discus). Not only that, He was adorned with kundalams (earrings), vanamala (flower garland), and possessed beauty beyond worldly comprehension. Both parents were wonderstruck by His form. His father was scared for the child’s life, concerned that this astonishing beauty might attract evil-eye. What if Kamsa finds out about the child and causes Him harm?!\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = krupaya: upasamhara\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = please withdraw this form, Kamsa will not tolerate this appearance. Mother Devaki also pleaded with the same mood.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = upasamhara sarva:tman ru:pam yathat chaturbhujam\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = if Kamsa finds out about you, he won't have it - withdraw this form immediately!\n\nBoth parents recognized Him as Lord and comprehended His divinity. However, they were mesmerized and thus, also were scared for his well-being. The purpose of His divine form at birth was to help His parents realize that He is the supreme soul, God Himself. He asked “Do you recognize me?”\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = ja:to:si de:va de:ve:sa sankha chakra gada:dhara:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = we recognize you have manifested in this form as a response to our prayers\n\nHowever, as both parents recognized Him taking a divine birth in response to their prayers, Sri Krishna anticipated they would ask for guidance on how to avoid such difficulties in life. They never asked. Rather, they were scared and prayed for His well-being as opposed to asking for some sadhana (a tool for liberation). Nor did they ask for a method that could help them allay existing troubles. What was He to do? He remained silent. He decided to go to a place where people are innocent, uncomplicated and not crafty. It seemed like He wanted to distance Himself from hypocritical life-styles. He demanded to be shifted to Nandavraja. He was shifted, and He showed His divine nature there as well. He hoped they would recognize Him and seek guidance on liberation from this world. However, no one asked. Even from the 7th day after birth, He began displaying His supremacy. They didn't comprehend. They were infatuated by the small baby they had received after a long time and simply wanted to take incredibly good care of Him. That was their only concern. They did not understand that His divine mission was to provide guidance. Therefore, He decided to illustrate His supreme power in various ways! Displaying his divine powers as a seven-day-old, He killed the demon Puthana who had come to kill Him. Instead of recognizing this and asking for guidance, others were focused on removing evil-eye from Him. Later, as a three-month-old, He killed Demon Sakataasura. At least then, they could have asked for a divine message. Still nothing. He tried to reveal His divine nature to His mother while she was cleaning His tongue with turmeric and as she took care of Him throughout the day. As soon as He opened His mouth, the entire universe was on display! She assumed this to be a dream or some illusion. Lord anticipated that she might seek His guidance as she realized His divine nature, and for having direct access as her son.\nPreviously when Lord incarnated as Sage Kapila, His mother, Devahuthi was fortunate to have sought knowledge of eternal truths from him. Srimad Bhagavatham states that she received a wonderful discourse on philosophical truths from Kapila Muni. Similarly, Lord expected that after recognizing Him as the Supreme, Mother Yasoda or Father Nanda would seek and listen to the eternal truths from Him. Hence, He showed them the entire universe [in His mouth]. However, afraid of evil-eye that might impact Him, they were only focused on protecting and taking care of Him. They did not even think of asking for or learning anything from Him! In this manner, He spent approximately 15 years there. Since there was no progress, He thought of a way to go to Mathura. Throughout His stay there (Nandavraja) He utilized every situation to prove His supreme divine nature. He showed His supremacy to Brahma and Indra as well. At the same time, He made the locals aware of the same. He hoped, at least then, they would recognize him. However, still nothing. They all saw the glory within Him, enjoyed His presence, felt protected, and lived happily. However, no one ever thought of seeking knowledge from Him. Hence, He decided to return to Mathura. He killed Kamsa, the Kuvalayapida elephant, and the wrestlers, Chanura and Mushtika. In addition, he bestowed blessings on a garland maker, and Kubja, by removing a physical deformity.\nAfter all this, He expected people to recognize His greatness and ask Him for knowledge that could improve life. Yet, no one asked. Next, He approached the great Guru Sandipani in Kasi kingdom. He stayed there for 64 days, learning and excelling in 64 different vidyas (arts). Upon completion of His studies, he asked permission to offer guru-dakshina (homage to guru). He requested His guru to ask for anything, “Whatever you command, I will fulfil.” Lord was hoping that His guru would ask for moksha (liberation) or some sadhana (practice) to aid the process. However, His guru did not. Instead, he requested the return of his lost sons, without showing inquisitiveness in learning philosophy. Again disappointed, Sri Krishna was in a dilemma. “Who in this world has interest to learn, with the ability to understand eternal truths, ultimately passing them on to future generations?” Even if nobody is qualified, at least some interested person should ask to learn something. After examining everyone, Pandavas came close to His expectations. “Finally! Let's groom them. Through them, Let me spread this beneficial message to the entire world.”\nHe stayed with Pandavas during their forest exile and during their incognito stay. He protected them every step of the way. He guarded Draupadi from disrespect in the king's court. After all this, He expected someone to recognize His greatness and ask for knowledge on eternal truths. Thirteen years passed. Pandavas' exile had been completed, and the incognito period concluded. It was now time for Pandavas to reclaim their kingdom. Negotiations were to take place. An emissary from the other side arrived to convey news. It was time to send an appropriate response. Sri Krishna asked Pandavas, “What response should we send?” Pandavas responded, “Kauravas should express what they wish for!” In reality, if people of great stature like Pandavas request something, how could Duryodhana not grant it? Sri Krishna was waiting for Pandavas to ask for anything so that the request could be granted. However, Pandavas did not know what to request. Finally, Lord inquired about Draupadi's request. “Draupadi, while Pandavas are asking for five villages or streets, and opting for peace, what is your wish?” She points to her hair asking, “Will justice prevail [referring to the horrible injustice that happened in the king's court]?” He reassures her, “This is the very reason I am going as an emissary to Kauravas.” Why is He going? Not for reconciliation. He is not going to form a peace treaty. He is going to pave the way for war! He confirms to Draupadi that He will fulfil her oath. “Whoever insulted you, a woman in the open court, will be brought to justice.” He successfully evaded the peace treaty and the war became a reality. Everything will be destroyed after a great war like this. With this in mind, at least now, someone should ask for divine spiritual knowledge.\nTo achieve this, He devised Arjuna’s confused state of mind, requiring a response for clarity. Thus, He created a situation to enable Arjuna to ask Him a question. Only then, Sri Krishna responded with all the necessary knowledge that would benefit the entire human race. This includes knowledge required to lead a good earthly life, and when one ultimately ascends to higher realms - , the various paths of the soul, along with the possible results. The essence of all the divine knowledge of Vedas, Upanishads, and the other scriptures was assimilated into Srimad Bhagavad Gita and taught to Arjuna by Sri Krishna. This is the principal knowledge for all of humanity. This is the true treasure of knowledge from Bharath. It is immense, yet, there is a chance for us to delve into these teachings, bit-by-bit, day-by-day.\n\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Human life is of the highest value. Millions of species inhabit this world. Among these, humans have the capability for acquiring good knowledge. We need a means to enhance that knowledge. With the right means, we will have taken the uttama janma (the highest birth). As animals do not seek the right means, they live an ordinary life. The one finding that right means becomes the one with the best birth. To provide these means, our great rushis (sages), meditated upon Vedas while in tapas samadhi (the final stage of intense, deep concentration resulting in union with higher consciousness). Veda is a large body of knowledge. It is defined as that knowledge which one must know. Vedanta is that part of Veda which is regarded as the beautiful essence that one must grasp. It is the quintessence. In fact, this essential knowledge is Bhagavan (God) Himself. Hence He is called ‘Vedanta Vedyam', or ‘Vedanta Thatthvam'. This is why our Seers eulogize and bow to Him as the essential core of all Vedic knowledge.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = ve:da:ntha ve:dine: the: namaha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = hey Bhagavan, my respectful salutations to you.\n\nWhy?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = na:tha:ya rukmini: sa:ya\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = your union with Rukmini accentuates your grace, showering your compassion on everyone, protecting those approaching you.\n\nWhen Lord incarnated as Sri Krishna, Rukmini was His queen. Uncertain of why, people recently set Rukmini aside and rather call Him ‘Radha Madhava', the beloved of Radha. Though Lord may have no objection, we should worship Him as Rukminiisa during Sri Krishna avathara (incarnation) as we are responsible to learn the tathva as it is meant to be. Examining the entire Srimad Bhagavatam, we do not find any philosophy relating to Radha. Though some explain Radha with their own reasoning, letʼs keep that aside for now. Rushi (sages), detailed recommended ways to approach Him. Sri Krishna preaches appropriate philosophy via jnana mudra, leading us all as a yogi (as a leader). He provided us with the greatest of teachings, the ultimate philosophy, with necessary inspiration via Bhagavad Gita. “Hey Bhagavan! Please inspire us by showering us with that compassion. To do so, be with Rukmini always!” This is the mode of our prayer. We always worship him coupled with daya (merciful grace), not simply as God alone. Why? His innate quality of compassion is superseded by His authoritative qualities. We need a tathvam which brings compassion to the forefront. That tathvam is krupa (divine grace). When that krupa is personified, it is Rukmini Thatthvam. In Sri Krishna avatar, that tathvam is named Rukmini. In Sri Rama avatar, it is Mother Sita. In His natural form as Narayana, it is Sri. Hence He thrives with Sri and is known as Srimannarayana. In Sri Rama avatar, He is known as Sita Rama, In Sri Krishna avatar, Sri Krishna Bhagavan is known as Rukmini Nadha. Hence, our agama scriptures suggest we always worship God with amma (the universal mother). One may wonder if even in Vaikunta there are gender differences. That question is not necessary. Why? The qualities of krupa (grace), daya (compassion), and kshama (forgiveness) in God are of feminine gender in Sanskrit. His authoritative nature is described using masculine gender words such as isithruthvam (controlling authority), and sarvesasvarathvam (all powerful). Hence, His authoritative ruling nature is referred to in masculine terminology. His Compassionate nature is referred to in feminine terminology. These words are then given a form (to aid understanding). Are they simply words then? No. They are real, qualified forms. However, for our understanding, when given a wonderful form, daya becomes mother and authoritative power becomes purusha (man in this context). The union of these two is worshipable. Hence, we never worship Lord as male alone or female alone. Thus, how do we worship? We worship them together as the universal mother and father. We worship them together as Lakshmi Narayana, Srimannarayana, Sita Rama, Rukmini Nadha. We worship any avatara together with the name of amma that reflects Her quality.\nMother’s compassion encourages father, God, to take good care of the children, us, addressing our needs. She brings out the soft, compassionate side in Him, while calming His authoritative nature. She enhances His love for us, ensuring that our flaws are corrected and that our needs are attended to. She bridges the gap so that the children, we, all turn into worthy individuals. Hence, it is appropriate to think of Him, always accompanied by the divine Mother. Only then, He accepts our services. Conveying this, Elders gave a beautiful prayer.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = krushna:ya: ya:dave:ndra:ya: jna:na mudra:ya yo:gine: | na:dha:ya rukmini:sa:yaha namo: ve:da:ntha ve:dine: ||\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = We bow to Krishna, the king of the Yadava clan, the one who shows the jnana mudra, the great Yogi, the Lord of Rukmini, and the one who is the essence of all Vedanta.\n\nHe is vedanta vedi, meaning He knows the beautiful tathvam described in Vedas. He shares that same knowledge, the essence of Vedas, thereby liberating us. He is known as Rukmini Nadha. He is a yogi, the one who knows the proper means. Each one of us is at a different stage based on knowledge and maturity. However, regardless of stage, He is the only savior. If we are learning the alphabet, He becomes a teacher who teaches us the alphabet. If we are learning a few words, He becomes a teacher who teaches us words. If we are learning complex lessons, He becomes a professor who teaches us those lessons. If we want to recognize tathvam and worship it, He becomes a yogi to teach us. This prayer conveys how all of this is explained through jnana mudra.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = krushna:ya ya:dave:ndraya:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = in the form of Sri Krishna\n\nHe incarnated in the Yadava caste, showing He doesn't care about what caste one belongs to. For anyone who has an appetite for knowledge, He takes a suitable form to deliver that necessary knowledge. When He was happy to be an animal, why would He hesitate to be a Yadava. When He had no issue being a fish, He would have no qualms in being a Yadava. He made Yadava caste worshipable across the world because He lived with them, took birth as one of them, and was close to them. He uplifts each caste and race that seeks His refuge. During Sri Rama avathara, He made monkeys worshipable. Interesting, right? We worship Anjaneya Swamy every day. It means that a vanara (monkey), can also become worshipable. When? When he receives Godʼs grace, remaining as Godʼs belonging. Hanuman proved this. Similarly he makes a caste noble, regardless of whether itʼs considered high, low, or middle. There is no place here for castes, which are assigned on the basis of karma. However, because of His incarnation in that caste, He brought honor to the Yadava caste, “Yadavendra!” He is Sri Krishna, the epitome of beauty, the source of happiness. He did not come simply to rest.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = jna:na mudra:ya\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = He is always preaching to us. He helped us all throughout.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = yo:gine:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = providing all the necessary means to uplift us\n\nHe uses appropriate tools based on oneʼs level. When in class one, alphabets are to be taught. When in class ten, lessons need to be taught. If one is conducting research, relevant material has to be supplied. Appropriate means are provided based on the time and need. These tools are called sadhanas. He is the one who knows all the sadhanas. Sadhanas are terms as yogas when performed with jnana (appropriate knowledge). When one utilizes only the body to perform a task, it is called a sadhana. When one utilizes knowledge while performing a task, it is called a yoga. As He has all such yogas under His control, He has become Yogi, Adi Yogi. When did He become Adi Yogi? Not recently, tens of millions of years ago!\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = yo: bramha:nam vidha dha:dhi pu:rvam, yo:vai vedha:scha prajino:thi tasmai:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = When Lord brought forth Brahma from His navel, He positioned him in a lotus flower, gave him four heads to absorb and hold knowledge in the form of 4 Vedas.\n\nThat is when He became Adi Yogi, Adi Guru. He taught Brahma lessons then. That was then. However, afterwards, He became a disciple of those who sought His refuge. He totally disregarded caste and gender. Once He became a disciple to a young girl, our Goda Devi. Goda Devi taught Him lessons! Thus, she is known as adhyapayanthi, teacher. He did not back away from becoming a disciple when necessary, thereby protecting His teacher and subsequently, the entire world. He knows the appropriate means for the worldʼs benefit. If needed, He even uses coronavirus as a tool. He gives what is necessary for the present situation to enhance knowledge of human beings. However, if we misuse and overuse, His tools teach us lessons to correct our ways. That is why He is called Yogi. Letʼs understand and meditate on this. Only then, can we understand and digest this Bhagavad Gita as intended by Him.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = krushna:ya: ya:dave:ndraya: jna:na mudra:ya yo:gine | na:dha:ya rukmini:sa:ya namo: ve:da:ntha ve:dine ||\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = We bow to Krishna, the king of the Yadava clan, the one who shows the jnana mudra, the great Yogi, the Lord of Rukmini, and the one who is the essence of all Vedanta.\n\nLetʼs pray that He graces us with the ability to understand Him through this teaching and continue this journey into Bhagavad Gita. Jai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Bhagavad Gita is the king of all scriptures, uplifting mankind. It was delivered directly by the Supreme Lord Himself. He descended as Sri Krishna Avatara and gave us this great boon. Where did He come from? Why did He do this? Adi (the first), Narayana Himself took the form of Sri Krishna to do so. Lordʼs descent is described in detail within Agama Grandhas (procedural scriptures). He exists everywhere and within everything, including the smallest of small particles. He exists inside and outside of every entity. This is a unique quality of God. Air exists within and around us. It is inside our body as well as spread around us, sustaining life. Akasha (space) exists in our body helping us lead life, and it is spread around us helping us conduct ourselves in this world. We know the nature of these two already, but both have their own limits. Supporting air and space, there exists an unlimited energy, spread inside and outside of them both, ensuring they work appropriately according to their nature. This energy is named Narayana Thaththvam. This Narayana Thaththvam is the eternal reality that blessed us with Bhagavad Gita. Is it not Sri Krishna who gave us Bhagavad Gita? It is. To uplift the universe, He descends by taking gradual steps. His first step is toward Palakadaali (Milky Ocean), where He exists as Vasudeva. He exists there not in one form, but in four - Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. With one form, He manages everything. In another, He creates. In another, He sustains creation. Finally, in another, He dissolves the entire existence back into Himself, ultimately bringing it back out again. Scriptures refer to where srushti (creation), stithi (support), and pralayam (dissolution) occur, as Vyuhams. Among vyuha forms, Pradyumna is meant for support, Aniruddha is meant for creation, and Sankarshana is meant for dissolution. To perform these tasks, He creates Brahma. From Brahma, He creates Rudra and then all the other devathas (administrative forces of the universe). With 330 million devathas, He conducts the universal operation. The strength and capability to manage all these devathas is given to Brahma. Lord resides within Brahma to direct creation. This is the vyuha process. He uses Aniruddha form to introduce each incarnation in accordance with the appropriate time. If we plant a banana, it generates several different sprout-like bulbs. Similarly, He created the Milky Ocean, within which He takes a reclining position. He fulfills the needs of His creation by manifesting various incarnations according to the respective time and need. These forms are called avatharas (incarnations).\nHis greatness is expounded to us through avatharas. He came as a fish to protect and rehabilitate beings near extinction. This was the first tsunami. The whole Earth sinks when a tsunami hits. Once, when a huge tsunami was about to occur, all living and non-living species were about to be washed away. At such a time, He created a boat, made saptha rushis (the 7 great sages) as sailors, and appointed King Satyavratha to collect pairs of all species carefully and protect them for 7 days. He promised the king that He would return to protect everyone. He protected everyone through King Satyavratha at the specified time through His first incarnation, known as Matsya avathara. When the count of various species started, it is likely to have been calculated as 84 lakh (lakh = hundred thousand) primary species, with many subsets in each. This was a necessity for which there was an incarnation, through which He showed that He is the qualified one to protect anyone in danger. Another time, He incarnated as a tortoise. In this avatara, He revealed that He can help anyone unable to overcome obstacles, by teaching necessary problem-solving skills. He incarnated as Narasimha to fulfill Prahladaʼs vow, proving He will do anything to uphold promises of His devotees, no matter what the situation. Each of His incarnations showcases His attributes. This ‘wealthʼ is referred to as vibhavam. All His incarnations teach us about His vibhavam, so they are named vibhava avatharas. Of these avatharas, the fully manifested incarnation which displayed all His exceptional qualities is Sri Krishna avathara. The root is Narayana. From there, Aniruddha emerged in The Milky Ocean. All avatharas emerge from Aniruddha. In those incarnations, a primary one revealing all His divine qualities is Sri Krishna. This is revealed by Srimad Bhagavatham. Agama scriptures proved the same. This is the standard accepted by us.\nSri Krishna avathara, originating from the primordial Sriman Narayana, gave us the essence of all reality and knowledge. His other activities like destroying evil are simply incidental. Sri Krishnaʼs primary goal was to deliver the ultimate knowledge for mankind, relevant for all times. That ultimate message is given in chapter 18, verse 66. Bhagavad Gita is the necessary prerequisite for that ultimate knowledge. If we try to delve into it without understanding the prerequisite we won’t be able to comprehend its essence. Let us also understand that prerequisite before trying to understand the ultimate. It is very significant and profound. Realizing the importance of understanding the vast profundity of that verse, Bhagavad Ramanujacharya travelled 18 times to learn its meaning from one of his great gurus, Sri Ghosti Purna. Sri Ghosti Purna lived 1000 years ago, and was a highly qualified treasure trove of knowledge. “Humbly seek this knowledge from Sri Ghosti Purna,” instructed Sri Mahapurna (Periyanambi) to Bhagavad Ramanuja. The humble Ramanujacharya immediately obeyed. He had the wonderful quality of following instructions of Elders to perfection, irrespective of apparent difficulties. When Sri Periyanambi (Mahapurna) instructed Ramanuja to visit Gostipuram and seek the essence of Charama Sloka, Sri Krishna's paramount message, Ramanujacharya proceeded enthusiastically. He lived in Sri Rangam which is 100 miles from Thirukoshtiyur, where Gostipurna lived. There were no means of powered transport. Since sanyasis (surrendered souls) shouldnʼt use animals for transport, walking was the only option. So, Sri Ramanuja walked the entire way. Sri Gostipurna noticed Ramanuja but did not immediately bless him, as he wanted to test Ramanujaʼs will. He sent Ramanuja home, deciding not to bless him with the divine message on his first visit. Ramanuja was disappointed. He did not get his guruʼs grace even after a long journey, that too while strictly fasting. Without losing hope, Ramanuja kept returning to Sri Gostipurna as instructed, sometimes months apart. However, Gostipurna kept Ramanujacharya waiting each time, fortifying his will. Fasting, Ramanujacharya walked 100 miles with hope, waited patiently, and returned disappointed, walking 100 miles back. This happened several times much to the dismay of the people of the villages on his route. People thought, if getting the mantra and knowledge for a great sage like Ramanujacharya is so difficult, then what about the common peoples’ fate? A lifetime is not enough! The compassionate Ramanujacharya promised, “if by guruʼs grace I receive this ultimate knowledge, I will distribute it to you all without fail - no need to worry.” After 18 attempts, Sri Gostipurna graced Ramanujacharya with the profound mantra, but only after checking several standards and taking an oath from Ramanuja not to reveal it to anyone. Later, as per his promise to the people, Ramanujacharya climbed the high temple tower of Gostipuram and shared the divine knowledge with all those interested. Sri Gostipurna was livid with Ramanujacharya – not so much for revealing the mantra as for violating his vow. As Ramanujacharya was worthy and humble, he bowed unto his guru and from his heart, expressed... “It was not I who revealed the mantra, it was your padukas (sandals), who did so. I kept them in front of me and only they uplifted all these people.” “Those who received this knowledge will surely be liberated from this ocean of sorrows with the grace of your padukas.” “If you are angered, only I will be banished to hell.” “That’s fine, however, let everyone else be uplifted.” Realizing Ramanujaʼs compassion, Sri Gostipurnaʼs heart melted. With love, he embraced Ramanuja, and titled him Emberumanar. The aim of this historic episode was to obtain the essence of charama sloka, the ultimate teaching given by Sri Krishna. The fact that Ramanuja had to endeavor 18 times for this reveals how vast and profound that essential knowledge is. To realize its importance, one needs to know this historical preface. The supreme Lord Himself appeared to grant this knowledge. That Narayana Thatthvam descended as Sri Krishna avathara to give the world this ultimate knowledge. Mesmerizing people with His enchanting beauty, and later making Arjuna as an instrument, He benefited the entire world. With the grace of the great Sri Krishna, let us all learn and benefit in the manner bestowed by our purvacharyas (lineage of gurus). Jai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Amongst world literature, Bhagavad Gita is the topmost scripture that has been translated into most languages. Perhaps, it has been translated into more languages than even the Bible. It provided natives of all those languages with proper direction on the right way to think and analyze. Such is the greatness of Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita is an elixir, a divine message given by Sri Krishna to Arjuna in the midst of the battlefield. Regardless of nationality or ethnicity, this text provides the best path for enhancing life, clarifying life's questions, such as why or why not activities are performed in a certain way. Such is the greatness of Bhagavad Gita. The 18 chapters of Bhagavad Gita is composed of 700 verses. In these verses, Arjuna speaks, Dhritharashtra speaks, Sanjaya speaks, and Sri Krishna also speaks. At times without explicit reference to his name, Duryodhana also speaks. Approximately 574 and 1/2 verses are delivered as an upadesam (teaching), by Sri Krishna Himself. Sanjaya heard it directly and communicated it to Dhritharashtra. After Dhritharashtra, it reached the rest of the world. It is necessary to recollect the context. Bhagavad Gita did not originate by that name. It was delivered as a divine message. However later, Sage Veda Vyasa named it 'Bhagavad Gita' because it is the loftiest of divine messages, delivered by God Himself. In it, we see that Sri Krishna is referred to as 'Bhagavan'. Generally, when someone speaks, it is annotated as such. As in, ‘this personʼ uvacha, meaning that person said that dialogue. When Dhritharashtra speaks, it says 'Dhritharashtra uvacha'. In fact, Bhagavad Gita starts with this (Dhritharashtraʼs words). When Sanjaya speaks, it says ‘Sanjaya uvacha'. When Arjuna asks a question, it says ‘Arjuna uvacha'. However when Sri Krishna speaks, it does not say ‘Sri Krishna uvacha'. What does it say there? It says - ‘Sri Bhagavan uvacha', meaning Bhagavan said so. In our world, we have many doubts. Who is God? Is He one or many? Where does that God reside? What is He like? What does He do? Many religious texts in world literature provided some answers to these questions. However, none are as explicit and clear as our Vedic scriptures. This is not an exaggeration. In fact, it is still an understatement. Vedas reveal Godʼs nature in unequivocal terms, with great clarity, eliminating any scope for doubt. Let’s leave the judging of the comprehension ability of Vedic commentators, to the listeners.\nGod, as explained in Vedas, is a treasure-house of all auspicious qualities, an ocean of all the highest and magnificent attributes. What does God look like? Does He have two eyes, two hands, two ears, nose, mouth, throat, chest, legs and arms? Perhaps. He could be like this, also. Vedas, instead of limiting Godʼs form as such, have described God – 'not only this much', 'not only this much' - nethi, nethi…\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = nethi, nethi\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = 'Ithi' means ‘like thisʼ referring to ‘only this muchʼ, ‘na ithiʼ or ‘nethiʼ means ‘not only this muchʼ.\n\nThus, [\"nethi\" means] whatever you have said so far, that is accepted. However, there is much more to it than only that much. After describing further, “not only that, there is more.” Vedas reveal that the quintessential truth, God, is pervading everywhere.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = anthar bahishcha thath sarvam vya:pya stthithaha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = anthar bahishcha (even in the smallest indivisible particle), He is pervading.\n\nEven beyond outer space and the huge constellations of stars, He is all-pervading. He is pervading both inside and outside of everything. Vedas named such an entity as 'Narayana'. This name can be given to a newborn son these days. However, 'Narayana' is not referred to as a name given to a boy. Vedas used that wonderful name, 'Narayana', to denote an eternal truth. The name contains two parts - ‘naraʼ and ‘ayanaʼ. Vedas gave a concise, two lettered word to describe all things recognizable in this universe - naras. Whichever entity happens to be ‘ayanaʼ (support) for these naras (things) - that is ‘Narayana Thatthvam'. ‘Ayanaʼ means support. What is the meaning of ‘narasʼ? How does one become the support of these ‘narasʼ? For example - if we sit down, the seat that we sit upon, has become our support. We are sitting on that. So, we are termed ‘adheyamʼ. Whatever provides support is named ‘adharamʼ. The object or person supported is ‘adheyamʼ. We hang a ceiling fan from the roof. Or, we put an electric light on a wall. That light is referred to as ‘adheyamʼ. The wall is called ‘adharamʼ as it is providing support. Similarly, the ceiling which is holding the fan is called ‘adharamʼ and the fan is ‘adheyamʼ. The entire collection of things which we can identify – either by sight, sound or other means - is referred to as ‘naras'. What is the range of things covered by this term - ‘naram'? It encompasses all things - starting from heights which cannot be imagined by us, to whatever lowest levels we can go, micro levels. If we split an atom 10^23 times - or still further if possible, even in that tiniest particle, this tathvam can easily pervade. Our scriptures reveal this to us. If we consider big things, according to modern scientists... ...this earth, solar system, The Milky way consisting of many such solar systems, this galaxy, any celestial objects which encompass all these, God pervades all these and everything else that exists. These can contain mobile and immobile objects. However, all these are referred to by just one name – ‘nara'. Why are they referred to by that name? The letter ‘raʼ means that which gets destroyed, ‘na’ ‘raʼ means that which does not get destroyed. If there are many such objects which do not get destroyed, that is termed as ‘nara’ (with emphasis on the second vowel). If there are many such species or collections of naras, that is termed as ‘nara’ (with emphasis on the first vowel). If there are many naras, that is termed as ‘nara’ (emphasis on both vowels). This is how this magnificent word is formed in Sanskrit. Perhaps no other language has a single word which refers to a collection of collection of collection of things. Sanskrit has this ability. Vedic scriptures have such power. Why are these called ‘nara'? It is because none of these get destroyed as such. Their forms change, their functions change, their names change. How? If we mix water with sand, we term it as clay. If we convert that clay’s form into a certain shape, we call it a pot. If that gets broken, we name it as a shard. If it gets battered further, we refer to it as a fragment. Subsequently, we call it ‘churnam”, powder. That again becomes sand. Sand always exists, in different forms. Veda says - ‘mrutthiketyeva satyam'. When the form changed, the name also changed. Then the function changed. However, the underlying matter does not change. Hence, these underlying substances remain forever. They don’t get destroyed. The quantity of such substances is numerous and infinite. The species or collections made up of these substances also stay forever. That is a wonderous aspect! Let us call the species made by such substances as ‘nara jati', collection of naras. The species walking vertically with two legs is ‘nara'. One ‘nara' (human), will die. However, the human-species continues forever. One tree will die. However, the tree-species will remain. One cow will pass away. However, the cow-species always remains. Thus, the collection of collection of collection of objects will always continue to exist. Underlying substances stay forever. So, all of these are referred to as ‘nara(s)'. The marvelous entity that supports all such naras - by pervading in and out of them, and protecting them - is named ‘nara’ ‘ayana’, ‘Narayana'. That Narayana, who emanated Himself in various forms, incarnates, descending on earth to address the needs of and give guidance to all naras. One such incarnation is Sri Krishna. To quell any doubt if He actually descends, two chapters in this Bhagavad Gita, 10 and 11, are dedicated to describing this essential truth, Narayana. Let us understand in due course.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Invocation\nJai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhulara,\nEtched in Vedic literature is an intriguing, divine name.\nNarayana.\nThe wonderful tattva that controls this whole universe and pervades everything in it is Narayana tattva.\nIntroduction to the Teaching\nBhagavad Gita, the foremost of scriptures, has come forth to prove this very Narayana tattva. This nectar of Bhagavad Gita delivered by Sri Krishna Himself, was gleaned by the great saint, Sri Yamunacharya Swami, roughly 1000 years ago. He established the summary in one beautiful shloka, verse.\n----------------------------------------------------------\nSloka\nsvadharma jnana: vairagya sadhya bhaktyaika gocharaha |\nnarayanaha parambramha gita shasthre: samirithaha ||\nExplanation\nWhat is the tattva clearly described in this science of Gita? It is Narayana tattva. What is clearly stated within it?\nparam bramha\nLarger than all, all-pervading, ruling and driving everything in this universe, is Narayana Tattva.\nHow?\nbhakthi eyka gocharaha\nOnly achieved through the purest form of love towards it.\nBhakthi is pure love - untainted, selfless, altruistic, untouched by one’s ego or arrogance. It is constant, consistent. That emotion is called as Bhakti in scriptures.\nBhagavad Gita states that bhakti is possible. Is it possible for humankind? It is.\nsadhya bhakti eka gocharaha\nHow does it become possible? By understanding and inculcating love towards that very tattva. Because of love towards that tattva, love towards other things should diminish. That decrease of raga (love) is vi-raga which is vairagya. One should refocus love, develop bhakti towards this tattva. In effect, love towards anything else other than this should diminish.\nHow?\nBy having a clear intention and understanding it with appropriate knowledge. What happens with that knowledge? One starts longing for that object of love. He begins working towards it, focusing all his efforts towards this goal. It's known that a person lives for the one he loves the most and stays away from everything detrimental to it. Raga (love) decreases towards everything else, and bhakti (devotion), grows towards that single tattva.\nswadharma\ndharma is performing everyday work selflessly, without arrogance, and without attachment. If dharma is carried out in a prescribed way as per one’s own placement, it is termed swadharma. When performing swadharma, one needs to acquire knowledge. About what? About ‘who I am’. Knowledge that ‘I belong to Him’. Who is He? The one who I should yearn to attain. What should I do now? ‘I need to reach Him’. Reach Him to do what? To ‘see’ Him, to serve Him uninterruptedly. ‘Everything other than Him is of no use to me or everything belongs to Him and only Him - not me or anyone else!’ When this thought manifests, inevitably the perception of everything around will enhance love for the One who owns all those things and much more. One then realizes that there is nothing to hate or love, one will start accepting everything as mere tools to reach Him.\nSaint Yamunacharya elaborated this subtle truth in a simple way.\nswadharma jnana vairagya sadhya bhaktyeka gocharaha\nThe more our knowledge enhances while performing our dharma, love blossoms for the 'one who owns everything around us'... ...this wipes off the ignorance that everything belongs to us or others but Him. From this sadhana (repeated practice), bhakti becomes sadhya (possible). This bhakti is defined as ‘sadhya bhakti’ which means God. He is seen and experienced through bhakti alone.\nThe same is revealed by Sri Krishna in the upcoming verses of Bhagavad Gita. He can be attained only through bhakti and nothing else. Yamunacharya Swami declared the same approximately 1000 years ago. After Sri Shankaracharya, Sri Yamunacharya was likely the first acharya who prescribed and concluded this as the essence of Bhagavad Gita. Yamunacharya Swami is the first acharya who expounded bhakti philosophy, bhakti siddhanta, and the nature of eternal love, prema tattva.\nLater, Bhagavad Ramanujacharya followed in his footsteps, blessing us with the great commentary, Sri Bhashyam.\nnarayanaha param brahma:\nBhagavad Gita also clearly states that Narayana is the Para tattvam.\nGita Shasthre: Samiritha:\nHe is clearly and unquestionably realized.\nTo make us realize this, three statements are reiterated at the end of every chapter...\nithi srimad bhagavad gitasu\nupanishadsu, brahma vidyayam\nyoga shastre: sri: krushnarjuna samvade:\n...along with the chapter number and type of yoga dealt with in it.\nThe repeated phrases at the end of every chapter.....What are they?\nyoga shastre:, bramha vidyayam, upanishadsu:\nThis is an Upanishad. A Brahma Vidya. Yoga: Shastra.\nShastra is that which commands. It commands to do certain things in a prescribed way, time, place, and how much...... ...as well as what not to do. What has to be done, what is prohibited, what can be done and what must be avoided. Something prescribing such guidelines is shastra.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nSANSKRIT WORD = sasana:th shasthram uchyate:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = one that commands an action to be done also has the power to punish if not done properly\nIf someone doesn’t abide by a government law, then the government has every right to punish him. We see that in this world.\nGita, as a scripture prescribes yogas. What is yoga? Yoga has many meanings. Now-a-days, the word yoga has become a buzzword. This yoga is different from the ‘yoga’ we are referring to. Yoga here means the means to bring us closer to objects we are meant to be close to. Yuk means bringing closer to, or uniting with. Us, meaning whom? The body? No. Is it a part of the body? No. The atma. The soul present in this body. The jiva. This jiva needs to reach a certain state. Certain means are prescribed to reach this desired state. These are the means – sadhanas or upayas. The means which bring one closer to his goal are named upayas. Those distracting from these goals are named apayas. There are certain upayas which one needs to practice. A tool that becomes your sadhana, a means to take you to your destination, can be termed as a yoga. Bhagavad Gita brings together all such means prescribed in Vedas, and explains them with clarity. It commands us on how to perform actions.\nThus, it is named yoga shastra.\nIt prescribes acharana (righteous conduct). It talks about the appropriate knowledge, jnana to be acquired.. It then declares what the derived bhakti or love is.\nswadharma: jnana, vairagya, sadhyam\nThat is why, each chapter of Bhagavad Gita ends with ‘yoga shastre:’. For one to develop this purest form of love, the manner in which love blossoms should be known. To help understand this, there are vidyas, fields of knowledge, prescribed in Vedas. These vidyas are known as Brahma Vidyas, aphorisms of ultimate knowledge. There are about 32 of these. All these 32 Brahma Vidyas prescribe how to develop devotion towards Bhagavan, the supreme soul. They clearly state what one must do, what one must know, and how one should utilize knowledge (to develop devotion towards God). Bhagavad Gita throws light on the way it is prescribed.\nbhakthyaika go:charam\nOnly attained through bhakti, devotion for God. Because this scripture discusses that tattvam only attainable via bhakti, it is known as Brahma Vidya.\nWe mentioned two names. One is Yoga Shastra and the other is Brahma Vidya. Gita is also named Upanishad. Let's delve in further and understand why it is known as upanishad.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nWhen enquiring about great topics, people say, “Oh, this must be a Brahma Vidya (implying it’s very difficult)!” If it’s an easy task, people say, sarcastically, “Is this a Brahma Vidya or what?” This implies that understanding a Brahma Vidya is not a simple task and is only achieved by tremendous effort. Perhaps.\nIn our Vedas, we have a few Brahma Vidyas. They help fulfill the purpose of life by ensuring we are kept away from recurring sorrows, keeping sadness at bay, enabling us to clearly realize our form and our nature, to regain our natural ability, and guiding us on what to say, what to see, what to think of, and how to think. Brahma Vidyas teach us all of this. They are named as upasana, methods of meditation.\nUpasana refers to uninterruptedly visualizing the desired goal in our heart. This constant visualization should be out of love. It can result from two causes: fear or love. When we know something is going to kill us and we become scared of it, we feel it is around us whenever and wherever we are. Just like Kamsa, who always imagined Sri Krishna around him. Whenever the letter “ka” was used, he would see Sri Krishna. In the case of Maricha, whenever he heard the letter “ra”, it seems he would see Sri Rama with bow and arrow drawn, ready to shoot. When He joined Vishwamitra to protect the yajna (sacrifice) at the age of 12, Sri Rama aimed His bow at Maricha, released an arrow, and struck him. Since then, he saw nothing but Sri Rama’s image. This is out of fear.\nrakaradini namani\nwhenever any word beginning with “ra” was used, he would see Sri Rama, out of fear. Similarly, 'kaka' radini namani - whenever any word was used beginning with the letter “ka”, including his own name, Kamsa would see Sri Krishna. This was because he was scared of Sri Krishna.\nThis condition of uninterrupted visualization can result from love as well. When lovers are separated, they always think about each other. They feel as if their partner is right in front of them, as if they are directly conversing. This is out of love. A child, when he is away from his mother, always recollects his mother’s words. A mother remembers her child whenever she cooks, regardless of the dish, because of the love for her child. This is out of love.\nBoth love and fear can make a distant object seem directly in front of a person as if he/she can see it clearly. In the context of God, this love is named as bhakti (devotion). This has been explicitly explained in our scriptures.\ntailadharavada vichhinna smrthisanthana rupa premarupa: bhaktihi:\nJust like when pouring oil from the hand, it flows without a gap, in a single stream. Or when through a wick, without any interruption, drop by drop it goes on to illuminate the lamp. Similarly, when the stream of thoughts illuminating knowledge within is filled with love, this is termed bhakti (devotion).\nOnly for this kind of devotion, God appears for us. If He appears only for this kind of devotion, then what should we do? When we recognize His beauty, His happiness, and His virtues - when we recognize our inherent bond with him – when we realize He is ours and we are His... ...each one of these has the ability to let us experience Him uninterruptedly, with love.\nIf one wishes to feel this way, then Vedas suggest that one should worship Him in a specific way in each situation. We can imagine our heart to be a lotus, and see God with mesmerizing eyes in that lotus. Let the beauty of those eyes absorb you. Or imagine Him decorated with all kinds of ornaments, with enormous eyes sitting in a beautiful lotus flower in the midst of the solar family. This is another type of upasana in which one visualizes Him as the ultimate tattva.\nDifferent types of upasana (worship), are done in different locations. It also mentions how to perceive the world around us when we exercise this kind of upasana. Because we are living in this world, we can see the world around us and connect the unseen tattva with the things we see around, dedicating ourselves to that tattva. We see honeycombs. Honeybees come to them. Honeycombs hang on a tree or some other place. They collect honey from everywhere around and deposit it drop by drop so that it gives enjoyment. Similarly, when we think of the entire world as one big tree, and when we recognize that God is like beautiful honey... ...just like the different honey bees that collect it, there are various divine powers that allow us to experience the many divine attributes of God. How do we perceive this? The flow of thoughts during this perception is one kind of worship. This by itself is named as a vidya (an art). Vedas teach us many such ways of upasana. These are all called Brahma Vidyas.\nThey mention thirty-two Brahma Vidyas. Why should we know about all these? The supreme tattva running the world, and that which is our goal, has extraordinary virtues. All those virtues are for our benefit. If we know them, this helps us develop devotion, then we can start worshipping with that emotion. Then, when karma bandham (karmic bondage), is broken, upasana helps one become eligible to reach that tattva directly and remain there eternally. We can inculcate such thoughts accordingly. This is another Brahma Vidya. To briefly summarize, a Brahma Vidya helps us inculcate devotion towards the goal and enables us to reach it.\nThis was described by Yamunacharya Swami as 'bhaktiyeka gocharaha'. This is why the words 'Brahma Vidyayam' are used at the end of every chapter in Bhagavad Gita along with 'Yoga Shastra', and 'Upanishad'.\nWhen we read Bhagavad Gita, the glory of the God is described a little at a time in the first six chapters, and in great detail from the beginning of the seventh chapter. When we learn this, love towards Him automatically evolves. Arjuna was also in the same situation as us in the beginning. When Arjuna saw the virat rupa (gigantic form of God encompassing the entire existence), he felt tremendous love towards Him.\nkarishye: vachanam thava\nHe was then ready to do anything instructed. This is Brahma Vidya. Bhagavad Gita, itself, is a great Brahma Vidya, a monumental Brahma Vidya. Brahma Vidya denotes immense knowledge. Bhagavad Gita is meant to teach us even greater knowledge in a beautiful way. This is also named as 'upanishad su'. What does upanishad do? It has no effect on people who do not care about these things. For people who have tremendous dedication to achieve something, whatever may come their way, it helps them by revealing hidden secrets.\nBhagavad Gita is such an upanishad. What does it convey?\nnarayana param brahma\nTo tell us that it conveys this, it is said 'upanishad su'. Every chapter clearly describes Narayana tattva. People wonder how that is possible? They say, “we read Bhagavad Gita, back and forth, top to bottom and all possible ways, but 'Narayana' is not mentioned!” It's true. The word 'Narayana' need not be explicitly used. However, when we observe the tattva described in it carefully, especially when we see the tenth and eleventh chapters, they are only about Narayana.\nWe spoke about the word Narayana. When all the things that exist are considered as 'naras'... The one who holds all these in Him acts as a base and is called 'Nara ayana', 'Narayana'. He is the one who is inside all these things and supports them. Thus, nara and ayana, Narayana. The same is described in the tenth chapter where He states how His presence in an object made it supreme among all its kind. The tenth chapter is a huge chapter. It is named after the detailed description of His vibhuti (His omnipresence). This describes how He became the base of all objects by residing in each of them.\nIn the eleventh chapter, after describing God's greatness, Arjuna asks, “can you show me? If you deem me capable please show me and then I will believe.” It meant that he did not believe it until then. Because he asked, Sri Krishna thought He should show it to him, and revealed His virat rupama. Arjuna was astonished, seeing the entire universe rotating within different corners of Sri Krishna's body! However, he could not understand where the beginning was, where the ending was, or where the center of everything was. He could not even figure out where he himself was! Arjuna was overwhelmed and requested, “I am not able to see this, Sri Krishna. Please revert and show me the form that I am used to!” When he saw the vishwarupa, He could not understand anything. The tenth chapter describes the essence of Narayana and His Omnipresence.... the One in many. The eleventh chapter describes the many in the One.\nAll the Vedas describe this. However, this knowledge can only be obtained by resorting to a teacher of great wisdom, with immense interest and learning it only from their preaching. That is why they are named as 'upa nishad' (upa = near, nishad = knowledge). To convey this, at the end of every chapter, 'upanishad su' is said. This Bhagavad Gita, revered as 'Yoga Shastra, Brahma Vidya, Upanishad'. However many times, in whatever way we listen to it, it remains forever new. Let us also experience this.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nVedas are divine knowledge necessary for humans.1 Veda translates to, “that which teaches, enlightens.” Veda is the topmost instruction imparting essential knowledge across all aspects. The specific parts of the Vedas containing teachings that can uplift us and release us from karmic bondage are together termed as upa-nishad.\nIn general, each Veda contains a small portion of Upanishad. Veda is a treasure trove of knowledge accessible as 1131 distinct branches. These 1131 branches are categorized into four distinct sections – Rig, Yajus, Sama, and Atharva. In each branch, the essential philosophical aspect of its teachings is known as Upanishad.2 Upanishad is that which depicts necessary knowledge directly, rather than through indirect methods.\nHumans have intelligence, higher than that of other living beings.3 Thus, humans have the ability to ponder over certain questions. 'Who am I, where did I come from, why did I come, what is my destination, how do I reach it, what do I do there?' Veda is knowledge intended to put this innate human ability into action. Since one lives in this body, Vedas also provide necessary knowledge to support the needs of the body during one’s journey.\nThe part of Vedas providing knowledge of worldly aspects is separated and is named Purva Bhaga. Since we need a healthy body to achieve anything, this Purva Bhaga shows how to fulfill bodily needs. This is the former part of Vedas. After leading life in this manner for some time, questions arise. ‘Is this the extent of life – constantly working to fulfill material needs?’ ‘Who is within the body experiencing all of this? Who am I?’ When this curiosity is aroused, when the question ‘how did I arrive here?’ is evoked… …when one starts searching for answers to ‘who am I, how did I arrive, who brought me, what is my destination, what do I do there’… …then he makes an effort to learn Uttara Bhaga of Vedas. Uttara Bhaga, the latter part of Vedas, contain most of what is found in Upanishads.\nUpanishads shed light on two aspects. First, the places one attains after leaving this body. Second, the state of complete release from karmic bondage. Once embodied, we reside in the body for some time. It is the same for everyone. Since all of us arrived with a set departure date from these bodies, we must leave at some point. Immediately after leaving this body, a new body is prepared. Karmic records force us back into different bodies. Until our karmic load is exhausted, new bodies are generated. When one is liberated from that karmic bondage, what is the destination? How does one reach there? Upanishads detail such aspects.4\nThey discuss Brahma Tattvam, the supreme eternal truth.5 That Brahma Tattvam gives the soul a suitable body, providing a strong place, energy and tools required to work for reducing karmic bondage. However, why did this Supreme Spirit provide us with all these? What is the purpose of the experiences that come with this body? First, to lead a proper life here, on Earth. If one leads life as it were meant to be, when the soul leaves the body, it attains a state never binding to karma ever again. This is the result.\nIt is not possible to achieve this with our own efforts and desire.\n‘eme vesha vrunute: tena labyaha\ntasyesha atma vivrunute: tanum swam’\nstates Upanishad.\nUpanishad declares, “Your efforts are useless in reaching that state.” There is a method to get there. That is via Brahma Tattvam. Though known by many other names, they are all integrated into the name ‘Narayana’. Isha, Brahma, Jyoti, Akasa, and Indra are the other names of that energy in different instances. Like multiple rivers merging into the ocean, all these names merge within the name, ‘Narayana’. The soul is able to reach that Narayana. Narayana Tattvam arranges everything materially required for the soul's journey in the current body.\nUpon leaving the body, the soul reaches other planes to exhaust karma. In those planes, devatas enable experiences for the souls. Devatas are the respective energies in different planes enabling the soul to experience karma.\nNarayana resides in all objects on Earth as well.6 Thus, Narayana resides in all material objects procured in this lifetime through various activities. Narayana resides within devatas who enable the experience of pleasures to souls that reach higher planes. Even in these higher planes, we cannot see Narayana directly. Here on earth, we perceive Him through various objects. We perceive Him through devatas in those higher planes. Our wisdom may not extend so far when trying to see Him through ‘things’. Our perception may be limited to the external appearance of objects. Thus, many people think all are Gods, and thus, equal. In reality, those divine energies are not Gods. They are devatas. He resides within these devatas and accomplishes specific tasks through them.\nWe can attain God, not directly, but indirectly. This is termed sadvaraka (via something). Even though Purva Bhaga describes obtaining Narayana via various material energies and devatas… …it is still an indirect method of attaining Him. However, with knowledge of Upanishads, we can attain Narayana directly, rather than by indirect means.7 Here, we use the name advaraka (directly via Upanishads, not sadvaraka). Thus, it’s not necessary to perceive Him through other objects or people. He is clearly visible…\nyeha sarvajnaha sarvavith yasya jnana mayam\ntapaha tadaikshata bahusyam prayayaha\nUpanishads reveal Narayana directly at various such places, displaying His glories. Upanishads are the quintessence of Vedas manifesting Narayana directly in front of us. Unless one is a true seeker and approaches a guru, one cannot attain this. We discussed this many times. Ramanujacharya journeyed to his guru whenever summoned. 18 times, covering hundreds of miles without irritation, hopelessness, restlessness, or ill feelings - and with full faith. Only after many attempts was he blessed with Guru's teachings. Upanishads become available to those with such sincerity. They attain Narayana directly, with little effort. Thus, when one has genuine interest, does not mind hard work, seeks Elders (gurus)... …and Guru, out of generosity, is pleased with the service of the student. He then gives ‘upa nishidya’. Upanishad is the knowledge imparted when the teacher is pleased with the student who approaches, surrenders, resides, and serves. Upanishads present Lord directly and we can experience Him via the teachings of a guru.\nBhagavad Gita is also referred to as Upanishad.8\nnarayanah param bramha\nBhagavad Gita establishes Narayana as the supreme spirit.9 Starting in the 7th chapter, Lord explains how He resides in various objects. What He does, how He guides this soul back to His abode... …the journey of the soul, how an unrealized soul returns back to this world… …how a realized soul attains Lord’s abode never to return to this plane… …how easy it is to serve and love Lord. The happiness experienced with hard-earned atma-sakshatkaram (self-realization), is like the dim shine of a glow worm, whereas the incredible happiness in reaching His abode is brighter than the Sun.\nHe beautifully explains the importance of devotion and love in the 12th chapter of Bhagavad Gita.10 He further elaborates on the same, with six more chapters, 13th to 18th. This philosophy is conveyed so well that one need not look elsewhere. It is laid out so clearly, as if ‘karatala amalakama’, accessible directly in our palms. Such a supreme scripture, Bhagavad Gita is also named Upanishad.11\nOther names are Yoga Shastra, and Brahma Vidya. In various situations, yoga comes to our aid. Yoga implies a method, a means.12 Bhagavad Gita compiled all such means in one place. It taught us how to progress through its levels. Every chapter in Bhagavad Gita is a yoga. The first chapter is Arjuna Vishada Yoga (Arjuna’s sorrow).13 The sorrow of Arjuna is also a tool. Vishada means crying, sorrow, and grief. How can this become a tool? To know this, we should explore Bhagavad Gita to understand. Sankhya is one yoga (tool). Karma is one yoga.14 Knowledge is one yoga. Restraint of manas (mind), is one tool. Knowledge is one tool. Each chapter is a tool. Every chapter is thus named as a type of yoga, sadhana (tool).15\nArjuna Vishada Yogaha,\nKarma Yogaha,\nSankhya Yogaha,\nAtma Samyama Yogaha,\nJnana Vijnana Yogaha,\nRaja Vidya Raja Guhya Yogaha.\nEach chapter is suffixed with the term yoga. Eighteen primary yogas (tools), are explained. Others are described randomly here and there. Thus, Lord presented us with the best scripture called Bhagavad Gita. When treated casually, it’s an ordinary scripture. Some consider it a scripture invoking love and devotion, some read it to pass time, some, to acquire wealth, others for various managerial skills. In any manner, Bhagavad Gita has the ability and capacity to meet a person's requirements in a particular field. If anyone has interest to pursue beyond, Bhagavad Gita is qualified to bestow realization of tattvam (the eternal reality). It is the utmost and the most approachable scripture.\nLet’s try to savor it bit by bit.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nBhagavad Gita was narrated to Dhruthrashtra by Sanjaya. Through this channel, the entire world received it. Gita Jayanti, its birthday, is celebrated on ekadasi, the 11th day of the waxing moon in margasira month as per the lunar calendar. On this day, everyone chants Bhagavad Gita. However, is it the actual day Bhagavad Gita was born? It reached the world on that day, but it was born on the first day of margasira. The battle of Bharata started on amavasya day in aswayuja month after tarpanas (offerings of gratitude to ancestors), were completed. The battle started on amavasya day.\nAt the outset, Arjuna, steeped in sorrow, declared, “I will not fight!” Sri Krishna used 'urging Arjuna to fight' as an excuse to deliver an upadesa (divine message). That's how it reached the world as Bhagavad Gita. So, when was its birth? The first day of margasirsa masam. Then why are we celebrating Gita Jayanti on ekadasi day? There is a reason.\nWhen it was decided that war was inevitable between Kauravas and Pandavas, everyone gathered to fix a commencement date. Veda Vyasa Bhagavan arrived at the venue. Dhruthrashtra offered his obeisances to the great sage. Appreciating Dhruthrashtra’s affection towards his children, Veda Vyasa offered him a boon of divya drushti (divine vision), to see the war live in action. Dhruthrashtra said, “When my children were happy, I couldn't see. Now, I don’t want to see them fighting... Do I need divine vision for that? I don’t want divine vision to see such a war situation”. “However, oh great sage, you offered me a boon out of love. Please offer the same divya drushti to my friend, well-wisher, and charioteer, Sanjaya.” He can narrate the situation when required. I will ask him and get the details.” Veda Vyasa then granted divya drushti to Sanjaya.\nThe power of divya drushti enables one to clearly view an event instantly when it is happening. Sanjaya, who is always with Dhruthrashtra, received this power. However, Dhruthrashtra never felt like enquiring about the progress of the war. Why? Because he was extremely confident. Why? Well, he thought, with Bhisma, Dronacharya, Ashwathama... and great men like Karna on his side, why be anxious! So, Dhruthrashtra assumed that the result would be in favor of Kauravas. However, the message relayed was different. For the first, second, third, fourth and up until the 10th day, there was no message from the battlefield. Nor did he enquire.\nOn the 11th day, there was a message saying Bhisma was struck down on ampasayya (bed of arrows). Dhruthrashtra felt very sad. He was anxious, “Bhisma! Such a great warrior! How did this happen? What are Pandavas and Kauravas doing?” Bhisma is loved and respected by both Pandavas and Kauravas, as he is a well-wisher for both. Generally, that is how elders should be. Bhisma had abundant regards for Pandavas. As he was the guardian and commander-in-chief of the kingdom, he trained the army with great discipline. Dhruthrashtra wondered what was happening, as Bhisma ended up on the bed of arrows despite Pandavas and Kauravas being present. That’s when he called upon Sanjaya and asked him to use divya drushti given by Veda Vyasa to narrate what was happening. He questioned, “What are my people doing? What are those Pandavas doing?” The question is odd. We will revert to it sometime later.\nTo answer his master’s question, Sanjaya then used his divya drushti and described everything that happened. Since he had the capacity to see everything directly, he replayed all events from the first day. Sanjaya started describing clearly to Dhruthrashtra the details about the exceptional prowess of Pandavas which outstands that of Kauravas. Sanjaya narrated to Dhruthrashtra exactly what he saw and what was happening, and that is what we are now referring to as Bhagavad Gita. After narrating it, he gave one important conclusion. Those whose well-being is being taken care of by Sri Krishna, and when Pandavas follow the advice of Sri Krishna unquestionably, they will always be victorious. They cannot be defeated. What does this denote? Victory for Pandavas! Defeat for Kauravas!\nSanjaya clearly confirmed that Dhruthrashtra will lose all his men fighting in the war.\ntathra srihi vijayaha\nbhuthihi nithihi dhruvaha\nwhomever Sri Krishna is with, that party will always prevail.\nWhat should Dhruthrashtra have done after listening to this? He should have asked Duryodhana and the rest to call off the war, advise them, and follow whatever Sri Krishna says. However, Dhruthrashtra’s pride didn't allow him to do this. He still held on to the hope that Kauravas would win the war. Sanjaya later clarified that his people will live no more. Even then, Dhruthrashtra didn’t make a wise call.\nAfter the entire narration, Dhruthrashtra asked one question to Sanjaya. “How are you able to explain everything that you witnessed so wonderfully??” He said, “we both learnt from the same guru, we lived together for so long, but your knowledge astounds me. My understanding seems inadequate.” “Did you take another course elsewhere? Have you approached anyone else to acquire such a clear understanding?” Sanjaya replied beautifully.\nvidya: rajan nathe:\nvidya: mama vidya: nahiyate: | vidyahi:naha thamo:dhvasthaha nabi: janasi ke:savam ||\n“Oh King, you do not understand Kesava. Even after I told you clearly that victory follows Him, your heart is not able to accept.” “My knowledge can never be destroyed.” “Yes, it is true that we studied together.” “However, now - you don’t even possess the knowledge taught then.” “It means nothing that you learnt got into you.”\nnathe vidya\nyours is not real knowledge\nmama vidya: nahi:yate:\nand my knowledge can never be destroyed.\n“Why did I not grasp it?”, asked Dhruthrashtra.\nvidyahi:naha\nyou lost your knowledge because\nthamodvastaha\nyou are surrounded by tamas (dullness).\n“Your blind eyes are not the cause.” “However, your tamas (ego, ignorance, deceit) are blocking your knowledge.”\nmama vidya: nahi:yate:\nas I don't have those, my knowledge is not destroyed.\n“Without knowledge, 'nabi: janasi ke:savam', you are unable to realize Bhagavath Tattva (supreme eternal entity), though it is directly in front of you.” “Though I have seen virat rupama (that divine colossal form Sri Krishna revealed to inspire Arjuna 18 days ago), the day before the war started...”\ntathya samsrthya -\ntathya samsrthya\neven now, each time I think of that form, I get goosebumps.\n“I was able to identify tattva because my conduct is righteous and I serve Lord with devotion.” “Thus, I have the chance to narrate this to you as it was,” Sanjaya explained to Dhruthrashtra. With that, he exactly relayed to Dhruthrashtra what Sri Krishna conveyed to Arjuna. Then the same reached the rest of the world.\nLet's try to understand in our next sessions how Bhagavad Gita can help enhance our lives.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nDear devotees,\nThough Sri Krishna delivered Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, it reached the world only after Sanjaya narrated it to Dhruthrashtra. Sanjaya started narrating it to Dhruthrashtra on the 11th day of the war... because Dhruthrashtra got worried and asked Sanjaya what was happening in the war on that day, ekadasi (11th day of lunar cycle).\nSanjaya explained how Arjuna was in despair and how Sri Krishna answered all his questions, guided him, and preached to him. This happened on ekadasi day.\nSri Krishna stepped down from the chariot and reached for a weapon, the discus Sudarsana Chakra, to stop the ferocious attack of Bhisma Pitama, grand sire. Bhisma Pitama challenged and succeeded in making Sri Krishna hold a weapon in the war though Sri Krishna promised that He would not. Once Sri Krishna held the chakra up high and jumped from the chariot, Bhisma Pitama stopped and said, “Oh Lord, you broke your own vow of not using a weapon in the war to fulfill my vow.”\nsatyam vidhatum nija bhrtya bashitam\n\"You were ready to let go of your promise to fulfil my wish as your bhrutyu (servant).\"\n“This is enough for me and is equivalent to winning the battle.” “My oath to make you pick up a weapon in the war has come true. Now, I am done with my war today.” “I am your servant. If you order me to drop all my weapons, I will immediately oblige,” said Bhisma.\nAfter this, Sri Krishna motivated Arjuna, waged a ferocious battle that caused Bhisma Pitama fall onto ampasayya (bed of arrows). This information reached Dhruthrashtra. He was surprised! He said, “Did Bhisma collapse?” “If Bhisma, the one who is unconquerable, has collapsed, then what is the fate of others?” He asked, “Hey Sanjaya, what happened in the battle?”\nSanjaya explained clearly what happened in the battle - how Arjuna was in despair... ...how he prayed to Sri Krishna who was his charioteer, how Sri Krishna preached to Arjuna... ...how the war started, how each day of the war went, and finally how Bhisma Pitama collapsed to the ground on the shafts of Arjuna's arrows on the 11th day of the battle. This recounting happened on the 11th day of battle. Since it happened on the 11th day, it is declared as the birth of Bhagavad Gita, Gita Jayanti.\nHowever, shouldn't we treat the first day when it was taught as the birthday of Gita? Maybe, but it was unknown to the world on the first day. It was only known when Sanjaya explained to Dhruthrashtra that it was delivered. Therefore, that day is considered as the birth of Gita.\nHow can we say that? Shouldn’t we consider the day when it was first preached as its birthday? Generally, that is what is expected. However, nowhere in the world is it said like that.\nConsider a baby in the mother's womb. Normally, it is around the 2nd or 3rd month that one confirms that a woman is pregnant. Is that when the baby is first recognized as being born? So do we consider that day as the birthday and say the baby is born? No one says that. When the baby emerges after having developed in the mother’s womb... ...manages to breathe independently, drinks milk on her/his own... ...then the baby is said to be born. So, on what basis is the time of birth decided? Is it when the head comes out? Or when the baby comes out completely? How should it be decided?\nThere is a principle to calculate the birth time of a baby. When in the womb, the baby receives food and leaves waste through a cord that connects the baby’s navel with the mother. Both processes of intake and outlet happen through the same cord. So the baby is still considered as dependent and unborn because he/she is still a part of the mother. When the connection (umbilical cord), with the baby’s navel is cut, then the baby is assumed to be independent. That specific time is considered as the time of the baby’s birth. Until then, the baby is not considered to be born, though we know that the baby is in the womb, growing inside as a male or female. Only when the baby begins to live independently, then the baby's birthday is recognized.\nSimilarly, when Sri Krishna delivered the divine Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, no one heard it then. No one knew about it, therefore, it's not the birthday of Bhagavad Gita. So, when is Bhagavad Gita said to be born? It was only when Dhruthrashtra asked Sanjaya what was happening in the war... ...and when that conversation revealed the upadesam (great message). It is on margasirsa sukla ekadasi that Gita Jayanti, Bhagavad Gita's birthday, is graciously recognized by everyone.\nOn the battlefield, there are elephants, horses, and many other kinds of animals. A variety of musical instruments are used, including horns, drums, and conches. In addition, people in war are consumed with rage, shouting, ranting, and making loud noises. Amidst it all, how did Arjuna and Sri Krishna discuss approximately 700 verses in the battlefield? This may be a question we have. These days, we want everything to be completed very quickly. We do not have patience to sit for long and listen to what other people are saying. Days have not changed, they don’t change, but our behavior has changed. If someone is speaking, we do not even think of waiting or staying there.\nThen, in the battlefield with 18 akshauhini (large count) of soldiers, with Sri Krishna and Arjuna conversing... ...did the others sit silently as good devotees for the discussion to go on? If not, how could they be audible with loud noises and different disturbances around? How could they properly hear each other without any communicational distortion? Did you ever get this doubt? No, you are all good people. You don’t question these matters. However, bad people like us get these questions.\nAn appropriate answer is given for this as well. The answer is: we are not sure how long Sri Krishna instructed Arjuna. It might have been a fraction of a second or 3 hours or 6 hours. We really don’t know. There is an interesting computer process known as AirDrop. AirDrop transfers information from one system, irrespective of the load of information, to another system... ...requesting Vayu Devata (deity of air), to please transfer information to the destined system providing the required identification details. All this information can be transferred to the other system or laptop within probably 1 or 2 minutes. We have this technology now.\nMaybe Sri Krishna used similar technology to transfer the complete message into Arjuna’s mind. Because, if someone spends hours together to carry on with discussions in a battlefield, will everyone patiently wait? Therefore, it might have happened very quickly. How is that possible when Arjuna is questioning Sri Krishna and He is answering, with this type of dialogue continuing throughout? AirDrop is a one-way transfer at a specific point of time. If this is the case, there would be no chance for questions. How would this work in such a scenario?\nWhile Sri Krishna is preaching, Arjuna must listen attentively, think, and come up with questions. For this to happen, there should be no sounds and distractions around. So, Lord muted the entire surrounding environment. He is Almighty, the Creator of the universe. He is the one who creates the whole universe with a sankalpa (an intention). There is nothing He can’t do. Therefore, He immobilized all the surrounding creatures. How long did He do that for? Until the discussion was completed, He wished that everyone would remain motionless. Everyone remained still, few with raised hands, few with mouth wide open, few in bending posture, others standing straight. Thus, every being remained like statues.\nHowever, Arjuna was not muted. He was operating Arjuna. Therefore, Arjuna was able to hear Him, understand, and ask questions when necessary. He was listening and asking. Sri Krishna was explaining and Arjuna was listening. Except for these two, everything was muted, silent. No other creature in nature could function. In this situation, both could clearly hear each other.\nSri Krishna unmuted the surroundings after the discussion was complete. Then, He set it to operation mode. It was thereafter that everyone continued the war. Therefore, Arjuna listened properly, understood it, asked questions, and we need not have any speculations about it.\nWhen Sanjaya explained to Dhruthrashtra such magnificent valuable knowledge in Bhagavad Gita... ...Dhruthrashtra asked Sanjaya, “how did you gain this wonderful knowledge?” “I am not sure how, however, I am able to understand. It’s unbelievable!” “How could you have faith in all these things? Can you please explain to me?”\nThe great personality, Sanjaya, answered wonderfully. We will learn about this as we continue.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nThere are three types of people in this world based on their inherent qualities or gunas: sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. Sattvic people recognize facts as facts. Rajasic people try to present facts as per their convenience. Tamasic people perceive facts in a skewed sense. Dhruthrashtra is tamasic. Sanjaya is of great sattvic nature.\nSanjaya was with Dhruthrashtra as a companion, minister, and charioteer. He was a childhood friend and fellow student. They had immense affection for each other. Sanjaya was neither hesitant nor secretive; he would convey anything he wanted to clearly without ambiguity. One of the rare, good deeds of Dhruthrashtra was to keep Sanjaya with him. At least he had a chance to listen to good things through Sanjaya. He was fortunate enough to listen to the entire Bhagavad Gita. The first person to listen to the entire Bhagavad Gita was Dhruthrashtra. In fact, he was the instigator, and he was the first one to listen. This is surprising!\nAfter listening to the entire narration by Sanjaya, Dhruthrashtra said, “How nicely you understood tattva (eternal truth). Fortunately, you also saw virat rupa (the universal majestic form of God).” He continued, “However, I have a question. Although we both studied at the same place, why do I not understand as well? How do you know this tattva so well? What is the explanation?”\nSanjaya responded, “Please don't mind me, oh king, but because you asked, I will explain clearly.” Dhruthrashtra replied, “No problem. I will not think otherwise, please go ahead.”\nThen Sanjaya said...\nmayam na seve bhadram the:\nmayam na seve\nI never approach with deceit. If I know something I will say it the way I know it. If there is anything I don't know, I will accept it instead of manipulating and boasting.\n“If I am unable to do something, I accept that I am not able to do it. I do not brag.”\nmayam na seve bhadram the:\n\"In case this hurts you, please do not mind, I apologize.\"\nna vrdha dharmam achare: shudhabhavangato: bhaktya: sasthra:th vedmi janardhanam\n“Oh King! Firstly, I do not deceive anyone.” “I do not speak anything that I don’t think inside.” “I only speak the truth, as it is, matching my thoughts and words. If I don't know something, I accept and maintain silence. This is my nature.”\nSanjaya apologized in advance, implying, “You rely on deceit to live. You are a hypocrite and do not have a pure consciousness.” “Not only that, even I do good deeds occasionally, like supporting charities. Sometimes I donate generously.” “I do this, but not in the manner in which you do.” “Whenever you do something, you publicize extensively for fame and maximum results.” “When you donate 5 rupees, you expect 50 rupees of publicity.”\nSometimes people come to us saying “We will give you some money, but you need to write our name in certain places. If you can do this, we will donate.” God knows what he would donate, but all the walls would be ruined with such donors’ names. His father’s name, grandfather’s name, address etc. He would want all these details to be mentioned. For the 5 rupees he gave, he would expect 5 walls to be engraved with his family name. This is arrogance. Although the deed is good, i.e. donating, the underlying intention is not pure. It is simply to brag, not to uplift the soul.\nSanjaya said, “This is something I do not have, and this is exactly what you have.”\nmayam na seve:\n\"Not only that, I do not expect anything in return for my good deeds.\"\n“You do not do anything unless there is a return. You do not give away even a single grain.” What is this called? Vrudha dharmam (useless virtue). Why? Because anything we speak or give is not ours. We are offering to God things and virtues given by God, to God’s own society, which in turn, is a form of God. This is instigated by God from within us and we are mere tools for this activity. This thought process should be within everyone. We are satisfied with superficial things. However, we forget that there is something that gives form behind these superficial things.\nSanjaya said, “I recognize that and hence, my deeds are for this reason only.” “That is why anything I do becomes dharmam (righteous), and is justified.” “You also do, I don’t deny. You gave one of your kingdoms to someone through your son, right?” “However, did that pave the way for good or bad? Did he rule the kingdom even once?” Dhruthrashtra did not have answers for any of these questions.\nna vrdha dharmam achare:\n\"My deeds are without expectation of publicizing name and fame. I do not have this quality,\" said Sanjaya.\n“Then how were you able to meet God?”, Dhruthrashtra asked. “How did you get His darshan? How are you able to describe it so well?”\nshudhabhavan gathaha\n\"My heart is always pure, I do not think about other things inside.\"\n“Your deeds are always dependent on how to get some benefit or how your people will be benefitted. You do not act with a simple heart.” “Not only that, I love God. You also love God, but why do you love Him?” “You love God to gain something from Him so that people will talk about you. You portray one thing and expect something else.” “Your intentions are not pure. They are artificial. I am not used to such artificial portrayals.”\nshudhabhavan gathaha\n\"That is how love and devotion originated within me.\"\nThat is why, ‘vedmi janardhana’ when we do not have bad intentions at heart, anything we do becomes righteous. If a person has a righteous nature, his intention becomes pure. When the heart is pure, love starts to bloom and that love lasts forever. For all of this, the root is maya (deceit). He behaves as if he is dedicated, but from within, he is not.\nOne instance demonstrates how deeply this quality is ingrained in Dhruthrashtra. After the war ended, as per his oath, Bhima challenged Duryodhana, who was hiding in a pond, for a fight. During the fight, Bhima broke Duryodhana's right thigh. Everyone claimed that this was injustice, but Bhima justified his act saying... “It is the oath I have taken in the assembly in front of everyone. I have not taken him away to a hidden place during the war and tortured him secretly.” “The day when Draupadi was held by her hair and pulled into the assembly, I took an oath to do this.” “I acted as per my oath.”\nDhruthrashtra came crying and said, “Oh Bhimasena what have you done? I am happy that you kept your brother’s words. I want to hug you. I have always kept you at a distance.” Bhima felt happy that his uncle was so affectionate, and he started rushing towards him. Sri Krishna stopped Bhima, saying, “Come here, you fool. You have a huge body but no brain. Wait here and see what happens.” Sri Krishna created an iron idol of Bhima and kept it near Dhruthrashtra. Dhruthrashtra thought it was Bhima and forcefully hugged it so tightly that the strong iron statue broke into pieces.\nWhat would have happened if it was Bhima? He would have been crushed. Even Bhima’s ego, that he was powerful, would have been crushed. That is how powerful Dhruthrashtra was. Even after all his sons were killed, he did not lose his treacherous thoughts. How astonishing this is!\nSanjaya said, “Oh Dhruthrashtra, only because of your treacherous intentions, you did not inculcate sanctity in your deeds.” “Thus, your heart is not pure, and so you lack bhakti (devotion) towards God.” “So, I know anything I tell you will enter one ear and exit through the other. However, nothing is being processed inside.” “If you understood, you would have stopped the war immediately when Bhisma fell, realizing that when such a great man was lost, there was no need to continue.” “However, you did not.”\nEven though Sanjaya knew Dhruthrashtra was such a man, he abided by his duty and relayed this Gita. Even today, we are lucky enough to listen to Bhagavad Gita. So, let us all try to listen and understand everyday with pure intention and love, devoid of any negative thoughts.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "episode": 19,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nSanjaya narrated Bhagavad Gita to Dhruthrashtra. It gradually spread across the world, reaching us. Sanjaya narrated it on sukla ekadasi, the 11th day, in Margasirsha month. Therefore, everyone graciously celebrates this as Gita Jayanti. However, Bhagavad Gita was actually born on the first of the month. We discussed this earlier. It was during the last moments of Amavasya, no moon day, in Karthik Month. Margasirsha had just began. Sri Krishna conversed with Arjuna on the battlefield. We have described how it happened.\nArjuna understood what Sri Krishna explained, but, when Sanjaya explained the same, the foolish Dhruthrashtra did not understand. Hence, Bhagavad Ramanuja refers to Dhruthrashtra as sarvatmana andhaha, blind in every sense. He is not only visually impaired, but also lacks the ability to comprehend. Some people may be visually blind but they have a heart that works well, and makes them respond accordingly. Dhruthrashtra was also blind from within. He could not understand what was correct despite advice from many well-wishers. Sanjaya clearly stated to Dhruthrashtra, “Your children cannot win the war,” yet, he didn’t grasp this.\nThere is a saying…\ningitha jnaha kosalascha, prekshitha jnastu maidhilaha, ardhoktha kuru panchalaha…\ningitha jnaha kosalasha\nThose from the Kosala, belonging to the Sri Rama dynasty, can understand one’s thoughts based on his/her behavior. Hence, Sri Ramachandra was able to understand Mother Sita based on her actions, and accordingly, advised her after the coronation ceremony.\nprekshitha jnastu maidhilaha\nPeople from Mithila, hailing from Mother Sita’s homeland, can understand one’s intention by noticing facial expressions. Mother Sita looked at Sri Rama and understood his intent - He expected Her to offer the pearl necklace to someone. She asked who it should be. Sri Rama gave the qualities of the deserving one. She understood and gracefully offered it to Hanuman. They are called ‘prekshi thagnis’, those who understand by looking at the other person. People from Kosala understand the intent of a person by their ingitha (behavior). People from Mithila do so by prekshitha (seeing).\nPeople from Kuru and Panchala are ardhokthaha - they understand intent when one verbally explains half of it. They need not be told everything verbally.\npurnokthyapi nadakshinaha\nPeople living below the Vindhya Mountains, i.e. all of us in the southern states, don’t understand even after explaining the entire situation. Perhaps people from North India might have composed this to tease the people of Telugu states. Actually, people from Telugu states are very intelligent and clever.\nKeeping this aside...\nDhruthrashtra did not understand anything even after Sanjaya thoroughly explained everything. Hence, they jokingly say Dhruthrashtra may have been friends with people from Telugu states. He asked Sanjaya, “How did you understand tattvam so well?” Sanjaya replied, “sastrath vedmi janardhanam.”\nHe understands God as the proposer of shastra (scriptures) or only through shastra. It means God’s nature can be understood only through shastra. If we want to understand God, it is possible only through shastra. We cannot speculate his qualities through our own perception, or physical senses. It’s not possible. It’s also wrong to declare, “I will accept only when I see visually and when I feel with my senses.” Sanjaya said, “sastrath vedmi janardhanam.”\nShastra instructs what is good for us, and we should behave accordingly, not via our own judgement, even if it feels right. Shastra defines boundaries and limits. It says what to do and what to avoid. If it says to do something to some extent, do only that much. We should not conclude with our judgement, “the more the better”. Do not do as you wish, do only as much instructed. We should not try to do more than what’s required.\nIn Vedas, for each seva (service), there is a requirement to chant a particular mantra from one point to another. It's not allowed to shorten or lengthen it even when incomplete in such instances. These are like passwords. They don’t work when adding additional characters. I.e., the password contains 5 numbers, but if you enter 9 numbers, it won’t respond and simply gets rejected. There is a mantra to chant while applying pundram (the vertical body mark) to Lord, ‘vishno rarataamasi vishnoh’... even though the mantra is incomplete. The full mantra continues, “vishnoraratamasi vishnoh prushtamathe vishnossaini petrestho vishnossyurasi vishnoh…” We may ask, “why not chant the entire mantra? Isn’t it good to chant the entire mantra?” Irrelevant if good or not, we must chant only the part required for a given task. Just because we know the entire mantra, it does not mean that you chant it in this instance. Perhaps the entire mantra has applicability in some other instance.\nThis is shastra. Hence, even when practicing dharma, we must follow instructions in shastra. Sanjaya says, “Maharaja, that’s what I practice. I have trust in God. You may follow dharma as well, however...”\nAlso, when it comes to purity of heart, people say that it need not be shown, it is all internal. No, we must take shastra as the reference here as well. We need to attain internal purity in the way recommended by shastra, not in our own way. One may argue, “I used sanitizer for 20 mins or 2 hours.” How long is not important, it is enough to simply follow the recommended guidelines in this instance.\nsastrath vedmi janardhanam\nWe discussed, bhakti means love. Even when expressing love, we should express it to the extent defined in shastra. Just because you love someone, it does not mean that you go beyond defined limits. That is shastra, one that defines/instructs. Hence, with matters related to God, soul and senses, (which are not seen with the naked eye) we should never say “I will do as I wish”.\nWhat then?\nsastrath vedmi janardhanam\nLearn what shastra teaches about how to use and regulate the senses. Practice it. Learn what shastra says about how to channel the manas (inner heart). Implement it. Learn what shastra says about the nature of love and how it works. Implement it. Learn what shastra says about dharma. Implement it.\nHence, Mother Sita says to Sri Rama, “Where did these rules come from and what are they?”\nkharsaithva yadhividhi prapyathe nipunaihe dharmaha\nShe means, “Dear Ramachandra, good deeds and righteous activities do not result from what we do.”\nniyamaihi thaisthaihi kharsaithva yadhividhi.\nWhatever boundaries shastra has set for each activity, stay within it. I.e., fasting is recommended on ekadasi. It is wrong not to wash your face because you might accidentally get water into your mouth. Shastra says even on the day of ekadasi, one must perform all daily activities like cleansing oneself, showering, sandhya vandanam and worshipping God. In the process, one must take tirtham and prasadam (sanctified water and food offered in service of God). One must take food as prasadam, not to satiate the tongue or hunger. If one eats only to satiate hunger, no matter what day it is, it becomes a sinful act. It is purified food offered to God and therefore to be offered to God within you. If this limit is crossed, the fast breaks.\nniyamaihi thaisthaihi kharas:ithva.\nThere are rules dictating limits for any activity, only to that extent one must practice.\nOne must not go beyond and above these defined rules.\ndharmah prapyathe\nWise people following this will attain dharma.\nna sukha: labyathe: sukham.\nPeople who think that limitless luxury brings happiness, are wrong.\nMother Sita explicitly stated this to Sri Rama during their Panchavati forest days when offering protection to the sages. Sanjaya says “As I have faith in shastra, I tried to listen to Sri Krishna and understand what He was saying in the order prescribed by shastra.” “That’s why, Hey Maharaja, I could listen to what Sri Krishna preached and convey this to you exactly as it is.” The Bhagavad Gita with a question from Dhruthrashtra who has lost both his physical and internal vision. That is how Bhagavad Gita starts. Let’s understand why we must also begin with the same, and continue forward.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Eternally, God has been attempting to uplift mankind. Scriptures describe His many avatharas (incarnations), descending to this world, making various attempts to do so. Humanity did not come into existence on this earth recently. Speculators with little knowledge say that mankind is only 10,000, or 25,000 or approximately 250,000 years old. This is not correct. Sages wonderfully preserved the history of mankind within scriptures and passed it on to us. Using yoga-drishti (seeing the past and future), and knowledge passed on by Elders, they documented the history of mankind.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = ithi sushruma pu:rve:sha:m ye:nasthad vya:cha chakshire:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = through this literature, we are passing on whatever was told by our Elders, just as we heard it.\n\nUnfortunately, we lost that documented history due to western invaders, particularly British colonizers. They desired their version of knowledge be studied by the entire world. Thus, they distorted world history with several modifications and passed it on to everyone. It was an imperfect, manipulative effort via guesswork, raising more questions than answers. However, our sages never gave any chance for doubt anywhere in their works. How so? They precisely grasped the history of mankind - starting from time immemorial - from Elders, and passed on this knowledge as-it-is, to later generations. We received Mahabharatham and Sri Ramayanam in the same fashion. We refer to both of these as ‘itihasasʼ (history). Not just for Bharath (India) but for all of mankind. Sage Veda Vyasa has documented human history for us.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = prithivya:m sarva ma:nava:ha svam svam charithram sikshe:ran\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = any person on this earth – even in the most remote corner – on any continent – in any direction - east, west, north or south...\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = prithivya:m sarva ma:nava:ha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = whichever place one might be, if he wants to understand his own history, can refer to itihasa (history)\n\nNot only to learn about oneʼs history, but also as a guide to lead a proper life.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = sikshe:ran svam svam charithram\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = he gave us such literature\n\nThat is the greatness of Mahabharatha. Mahabharatha is so valuable because it contains an elixir, a concise teaching, Srimad Bhagavad Gita. The dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna famously became known as Bhagavad Gita. Vyasa incorporated this very nicely into Mahabharatha and gave it to us. Why was it necessary to prescribe Bhagavad Gita? We should understand why. God wanted to prepare mankind for an ideal life – both in this material world and in other worlds. Humans are the only species who need to be told in order to understand. Animals need not be told. They lead life on their own. Birds need not be told. They lead life on their own. All other species also live appropriately. The only species which cannot distinguish between right and wrong is human-kind. What can be eaten vs what should not be... ...what can be drunk vs what cannot be... ...what can be spoken vs what should not be uttered... ...mankind is the only species unable to distinguish between these. “Hence, it is important humans be taught, and this can be done only by Me. This responsibility should not be left to anybody else,” thought God.\nWith each avatara (incarnation), He made attempts. However, He manifested all aspects of His powers in Sri Krishna avatara. He needed to complete everything required in this avatara (incarnation) itself. This would be the last manifestation in which He would freely walk about. After Sri Krishna avatara, He will not manifest in a form which can move freely. “I will manifest in other forms as archa murthi (deity), a mountain, or a rock, etc.” “However, there will be no other manifestations free to walk about.” Hence, God decided, “I need to teach everything required now itself,” Yet, who is there to listen? Who has interest in listening? Who is there to ask Lord?\nAmong the contemporaries of that day, there were many learned Elders - scholars like Bhishma, Drona and others. However, due to their intense devotion, they did not feel the need to ask God. There were many great Kings. Due to their pride, they also did not ask. The remaining common people were not learned and hence did not think of asking. God made many attempts. He created many situations so that people might ask. However, nobody showed any taste. Thus, He had to create an appropriate ‘settingʼ. That became the great Mahabharatha war!\nLet us recollect what happened just before the war. Pandavasʼ aranya vasa (forest exile) and agnatha vasa (incognito exile), had come to an end. Later, Pandavas, the five sons of Pandu, tried to reclaim their rightful share of the kingdom. As part of those efforts, Sri Krishna took on the role as a messenger and went to Hasthina, the kaurava kingdom. In actuality, Sri Krishna did not go as a messenger of peace. His aim was to ensure there would be no peace agreement – in line with what Draupadi prayed for. Her husbands were calling for peace. Yet, there was one dastard who invited Draupadi to sit on his lap. There was another vile person who dragged her, by the hair, to the Kingʼs court. Bhima had vowed to tear the chest of the evil fellow who dragged Draupadi by her hair. However, he was also on the peace path following his elder brother. Amidst the council members, Bhima also vowed to break the thighs of the dastard who had insulted Draupadi. Yet now, obeying his elder brother, he was simply parroting the same peace mantra. Shouldnʼt both vows be fulfilled? Only if these two vows are fulfilled, could Draupadi feel justice. “My dear brother – you are clever, multi-skilled and unbeatable. You are going as a messenger now. You can achieve anything,” prayed Draupadi. Sri Krishna assured her. “I am going to achieve the same. All the earlier vows will be fulfilled and your hair will eventually be tied properly, my dear sister. Rest assured.”\nWhen Sri Krishna came to Hasthina, Duryodhana was willing to do anything to win His alliance. Duryodhana ordered all the houses to be readied, delicacies to be prepared “At whichever house Sri Krishna decides to stay, I will arrange delicacies to be prepared and bring Him to my side,” thought Duryodhana. However, Sri Krishna skipped all those houses and went directly to Viduraʼs home. Vidura did not expect that Lord would visit his house. He was so surprised that he even forgot to welcome Sri Krishna inside. He offered a small seat to Sri and started dancing on it. Lord asked, “I am the guest. Why are you dancing on the seat offered to me?” Vidura said, “Oh no! Apologies, Sri Krishna! Just as they did in the court earlier today, when your chair had a hole in it, I was afraid someone tampered with this one as well.” Lord was blissful with Viduraʼs devotion. So much so, he thoroughly enjoyed even the fruit peels offered by Vidura.\nWhen Sri Krishna returned to the kingʼs court, Duryodhana asked, “You are Pundarikaksha (the one with beautiful wide eyes).” “Didnʼt you notice we were all waiting respectfully at our doorsteps to welcome you?” If the Lord actually intended to arrange peace, what should He have said? “As Vidura is my old friend, I stopped by his house and he compelled me to have food there.” Lord said nothing like that, however. He said “one should not stay at the enemyʼs house, nor accept food there.” “If someone says ‘you are my enemyʼ, will there be any scope for peace?” He antagonized Duryodhana with His words, “Donʼt you hate Pandavas?” Duryodhana replied, “Yes, we naturally clash, we are cousin-brothers after all.” Lord said, “They are my internal life force. If you hate my internal energy, how can you possibly love me? I accept Pandavas as my prana (life).” Thus, He successfully broke down any chance of peace between both sides. He arranged for war to start, thus, accomplishing His mission.\nHe hoped that at least then, someone would ask Him [about the purpose of life]. Yet, even then, nobody asked. Both armies arrived face-to-face for war with weapons drawn. As a last resort, He used His yogic powers to transform Arjunaʼs heart and create a situation whereby Arjuna could express curiosity and seek instruction. Thus, His avataraʼs (incarnation's) purpose could now be fulfilled. As if to address Arjunaʼs queries, Sri Krishna gifted the world this deep, yet lucid essence of Vedas as Bhagavad Gita. It is forever new. Whenever we take a dip in it, our doubts are cleared. It gives us fresh energy and is needed for all of us at this juncture. Let us try to enjoy it to some extent and strengthen our inner selves.\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nThe first chapter of Bhagavad Gita is known by the title, ‘Arjuna Vishada Yogaha’. We already discussed that the 700 verses of Bhagavad Gita are split into 18 chapters. Each chapter is named ‘Yoga’. The first chapter is named ‘Arjuna Vishada Yogo Nama pradhamodhyayaha’. Elders decided to start this chapter with the name of Dhruthrashtra. Generally, we start any work or event with the name of God for positivity. However, Bhagavad Gita begins with the name Dhruthrashtra, who was blind both physically and internally. Let’s start following the same path laid by the Elders. We will begin learning the summaries and key points of all the verses as passed onto us by Elders. This is a class. Do not consider it as a discourse or a speech to entice interest. Realizing that Bharat has inherited the greatest source of knowledge, we should all try to at least learn our root scripture, Bhagavad Gita.\nWhat is it that our rushis (sages) like Veda Vyasa established and gave us through these scriptures? As its proud descendants let us try to earn the qualification to learn it or at least grasp its surface level meaning. This is an effort in that direction. Let’s attempt to understand the significance and summary of each verse appropriately. Likewise, let us attempt to find any subtleties within. On the off chance that somebody misinterpreted a couple of words here and there, let us try to understand the correct meaning. It is the aspiration of those who shared it, that we ought not to fall into that dilemma. When learning something, let’s have a clear and complete understanding of it. Primarily, we must learn for our understanding. Secondly, when someone else asks us face-to-face what we know of our great Bhagavad Gita, we should be able to speak about it with confidence. Let’s try to learn it with that objective. We start with Dhruthrashtra as the first word.\n‘Srimad Bhagavad Gita Pradhamodhyayaha Arjuna Vishada Yogaha’\nFor each chapter, its number and name are recited. This is for the first chapter. For the second chapter onwards, we use the word ‘atha’, meaning ‘the next one’. Thus, the word ‘atha’ is not used for the first chapter.\nPradhamodhyayaha followed by the name of the chapter Arjuna vishada yogaha. Similarly, we end each chapter with a notation. For the second chapter, we say ‘atha dwitiyodhyayaha sankhya yogaha’. Therefore... ‘Atha’ is used for the rest of the chapters indicating ‘next one in order’. In the first chapter, the first verse itself is significant. This sloka reveals a question from Dhruthrashtra.\ndhruthrashtra uvacha\nDhruthrashtra called upon Sanjaya and inquired...\ndharma kshethre kurukshethre samavetha yuyuthsavaha |\nmamakah pandavas chaiva kim akurvatha sanjaya! ||\n\"Hey Sanjaya, they have assembled at Kurukshetra, where dharma (righteousness) is protected. Why did they assemble? Is it why? Or what did they do?\"\nyuyuthsavaha samavetha\n\"With a desire to wage a war.\"\n\"Who all assembled?\"\nmamakah pandavas chaiva\n\"My people, and Pandavas too.\"\nPandavas are his people. Duryodhana and team are also his people. However, he mentioned his people and the Pandavas assembled to fight each other.\nkim akurvatha sanjaya\n\"Kim akurvatha, what did they do?\"\nThis is the question. It seems absurd. He doesn’t seem wise in asking this question. He clearly mentioned that they assembled on the battlefield to fight. He then asked “what did they do?” akurvatha means ‘did’. kim akurvatha means ‘what did they do?’ When people assemble at a war zone, they battle. They don't go for lunch or take a nap. Some people take rest while working. However, there is zero chance to rest or play in a war zone. They need to battle. Wherever we go to accomplish a task, we must be working on the task appropriate to that place. We all know this. A person like Dhruthrashtra also must know this.\nyuyuthsavaha samavetha\nassembled, desiring to fight, both my people and Pandavas.\nkim akurvatha\n\"What did they do, Sanjaya?\"\nThe nature of this question reveals Dhruthrashtra’s mean nature. How? He began by asserting that this is a dharma kshethra, the place enhancing one’s buddhi (intellect). One should understand what ‘enhance’ means. When one joins this place, his innate nature will grow. A sattvic (good) person becomes more sattvic. A rajasic (ego-driven) person becomes more rajasic. A tamasic (ignorant) person becomes more tamasic. “My sons, Kauravas, arrived here with a firm intention for battle. Thus, their desire to fight grows multifold.” Then again, Pandavas are good-natured and peace-loving people. They have no desire to fight and see bloodshed. They preserve peace. They are of the type ‘when slapped on one cheek, they show the second one as well.’ When they are in this kshetra, this nature will be enhanced.\nThus, Dhruthrashtra thought that his people would win the kingdom so easily that not a strand of hair on their heads would be lost. That’s because of the nature of the kshetra. It is dharmakshetra! Thus, what would it, the kshetra do? “This place will make Pandavas soft-hearted, wanting no bloodshed. They would rather beg if required, and halt the war by any means. This would be the effect of kshetra on them. Whereas my people, Kauravas, will not back off. Therefore, there is no question of the war beginning. It’s a walkover for Kauravas.” This is what Dhruthrashtra assumed, and it began exactly the same way.\nArjuna did not want to fight. He felt, “What is the use of killing everyone? What is the use of the kingdom after killing those I care for?” “I can’t live ruling a kingdom acquired by bloodshed. I don’t want it.”\nka prithis syath janardana\n\"Where is the bliss in this? I don't need this any longer.\"\nsreyo bhokthum bhaiksham apiha loke\n\"Begging is far superior than war- I don't need this.\"\n“Luxurious or not, we don’t need anything. It’s okay for us to live the way we are now.” Dhruthrashtra guessed that these thoughts would arise in the minds of Pandavas and it was precisely their reaction. Sri Krishna was there leading Pandavas. He ensured what needed to be done was done. Otherwise, Kauravas would have exiled Pandavas for another 12 or 13 years to forests. They would have neither given a chance for them to enter the kingdom nor let them live peacefully there.\nThe first verse begins with ‘dharma kshethre’. Then ‘kuru kshethre’. King Kuru was the progenitor of all assembled. Hence, it is dharma kshethre. All are assembled here.\nkim akurvata\n\"What did they do?\"\nSounds funny. An inappropriate question when they have assembled to fight a battle - a better question would have been ‘katham akuruta - how did they fight?’ When one goes to a dining hall, it makes sense to ask what they had to eat, not what they did. Similarly, katham akuruta should be asked, not kim akurvata. Here, Dhruthrashtra's malevolent expectations are clear. Pandavas won’t fight. Kauravas will easily win. His malicious mood is uncovered by another word. Let’s discuss in our next session.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus,\nLet's understand a few interesting facts from chapter 1, verse 1 of Bhagavad Gita.\nWe begin reciting Bhagavad Gita with the name of Dhruthrashtra, who is blind in every way (physically and internally).1 We will understand why later.\nDhruthrashtra asked Sanjaya, “Pandavas and Kauravas gathered on the battlefield to fight each other. What did they do?”\nAs is known, people go to a battlefield to fight.\nHowever, Dhruthrashtra did not ask how Pandavas or Kauravas were doing, nor what each one was doing. However, he asked what they were all doing on the whole.\nHis intention was to know if the righteous nature in Pandavas grew, and the selfish nature in Kauravas grew. Consequently, he wanted to know if Pandavas sacrificed the kingdom and opted for exile, resulting in Kauravas regaining their glory, power and kingdom without struggle. This was the ulterior selfish motive of Dhruthrashtra.\nTherefore, his question to Sanjaya was...\nkim akurvatha\nwhat did they do?\nThe thought of asking such a question must have originated from the effect of the battlefield, Kurukshetra. To describe how Kurukshetra was he used a great adjective for the place, in the beginning of his question.\ndharmakshethre\nthis place is the abode of righteousness.\nWhat is the greatness of Kurukshetra?\nWhy did it become Dharmakshetra, the land of righteousness? This is something we need to understand.\nKing Kuru was the main root ancestor of both Pandavas and Kauravas.2 He was born to Samvarana and Thapathi.3\nDuring his time, Kuru had ploughed this land with an intention that whoever takes birth here should attain heaven. He did not want anyone born on his land to go to hell. Such was his magnanimity. If rulers are this broad-minded, their citizens are truly blessed. They need not wait for any heaven; they will be happy here itself.\nHowever, we are all aware of our rulers and their apathy these days.\nIn the bygone days, King Kuru looked after his subjects with such generosity. So, he ploughed the entire land. By ploughing, he made the land and the nation more prosperous. Hence the name, Kurukshetra.\nWhile Kuru was at it, Indra forbade him many times, as it would increase the inhabitants in heaven. This will cut down facilities and cause inconvenience to the inhabitants of heaven making it hard to manage.\nWith utmost belief in Veda and with great persistence, King Kuru went ahead with ploughing the land. Witnessing the undying will of Kuru, Indra blessed him with a boon.\n“Whoever leaves the body here with an empty stomach (nirahara) will attain heaven.”\nNot only this, since this land is vast, when there comes a need to fight a battle here, all the warriors who die in the battle here will also attain heaven.\nDue to Indra's boon, Kurukshetra became Dharmakshetra, the land of righteousness.\nThere is another historical episode that speaks about the profound importance of this land.\nWe have all heard of Parasurama or Bhargavarama. The implacable person that he was, he held Parasu, the axe. Wielding it on his back, he walked the entire earth. He is named Trisaptakruthvaha, meaning he walked the entire earth 21 times. Why?\nTo find and behead the rulers who demeaned Vedic practices, or those who belittle the pious people learning Vedas. Beheading them was his mission. So great was Bhargavarama. He was aggressive and did not tolerate immoral attitudes in anyone. .\nHe walked 21 times around the earth to uproot unjust rulers and those who are against Vedas, practiced bad deeds. By this mission, he expunged those who caused suffering to mother earth. In this process, he created 5 lakes containing the blood of the tyrannous rulers of mother earth. He named them Samantha Panchakam. He created this as an offering to pithru devathas, forefathers... for the love of his father, a saint who lost his life due to a despot known as Kartha Viryarjuna. To alleviate his fury and to free the rest of the earth from such faults, not only did he kill Kartha Viryarjuna but he created the Samantha Panchakam from the blood of such rulers.\nHe was a great person for having offered tharpanas, gratitudinal offerings and thus provided peace to his ancestors. The kshetram’s significance lies in its ability to satisfying the ancestors.\nWhat does this mean? If our ancestors are happy, then our activities in this current birth go smoothly.\nSometimes, we put in all the effort and follow the right processes. Yet we do not attain success in our work. It looks as if success is round the corner, but it doesnʼt happen. We reach close but it is elusive at the last moment. This is something that most people experience many times in their life. We are not aware of why this happens. According to the scriptures, this happens because our attitude towards ancestors was not justified.\nIf we can please our ancestors, by offering tharpanas, offerings or performing havan, fire sacrifice, we can then get past the obstacles in achieving our goals. It can be business, education or any other endeavor. Maybe your child is well educated and beautiful but somehow not able to find a suitable match for marriage. Such problems can be resolved when one clears the fault of not honoring ancestors.\nWhen these offerings are made to ancestors in a land like Kurukshetra, they become much more fruitful. This is why many great sages and saints have chosen Kurukshetra to perform dhirgha sathra yagam, which can last a year or longer.\nSome yagas are performed for half a day, a day or two or three or five or nine or eleven days. Some are performed for as long as a year. If a yajna crosses one year, it is termed as ‘dhirgha sathra yagam’. Such yajnas are performed with many participants, both donors and doers. Such yajnas are termed sathra yajnas. If it lasts a long time, it is termed dhirgha sathram.\nMany people performed dhirgha sathra yagas in Kurukshetra. Hence, Kurukshetra became the land of righteousness.4\nThere is one more reason why Kurukshetra has powerful energy. In ancient times, there lived a great saint called Dadhichi.5 Dadhichi was known for his sacrifice.6 Indra and devathas (God’s administrative force) requested Dadhichi, “Please give us your backbone so we could use it as a weapon to win against our enemies. For our sake, donate your spinal cord”. Reflecting on how the world would benefit through them, Dadhichi not only convinced his pregnant wife, but also arranged his own pyre for the ultimate sacrifice.\nHe sacrificed his body, so his spinal cord could be used as a weapon to fight evil. All the other bones from his body were made as weapons to support devathas, God's administrative force. So that they could fight the evil forces, much like the present day pandemic COVID-19. It was troubling the whole world; a vaccine was needed to destroy it. That vaccine was the great sage Dadhichi’s spinal cord. We don't have a perfect solution yet, but devathas obtained their vaccine through Dadhichi to fight their evil.\nSuch was Dadhichi’s benevolence; he sacrificed himself for the well-being of the world.7\nWe all heard of Ramanujacharya. History tells us that he was willing to accept permanent hell as a result of sharing the sacred manthra which begets liberation to humanity. Even later after many ages, such sages remained an inspiration for Ramanujacharya.\nBefore Dadhichi sacrificed himself per Indra’s request, he did not forget to appease his ancestors. He made a wish to devathas to conjoin all rivers to this Kurukshetra to perform sacred rites. With the precious waters from these rivers, he made offerings to his ancestors on amavasya, no moon day of the lunar cycle.\nHenceforth, to this day, Kurukshetra remains the favored destination for making offerings to our ancestors on amavasya. It is also the destination for scientists to observe solar and lunar eclipses.\nHence, Kurukshetra became the celestial destination where many rivers converge and where people make offerings to their ancestors on amavasya.8 This is why Kurukshetra is named sannithi, confluence of many rivers, where the greatest of events occurred.\nKnowing the importance and the effect of this land, they decided to have the war here. Because of this, Pandavas and Kauravas waged war in Kurukshetra.9\nScriptures established that anyone who leaves the body here, due to any cause, will surely attain the heavenly abode.\nThus, Dhruthrashtra thought his sons, Kauravas, would regain the reign of Kuru Kingdom, and Pandavas would opt for exile.\nkim akurvatha sanjaya\nin addition, Dhruthrashtra had another ulterior motive in mind.\nIt is evident in the words he used. What are those words?\nLet's discuss further.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya bhagavadbandhus,\nBhagavad Gita starts by mentioning a blind man. That’s because the human race should emerge from blindness and approach the light.\nthamaso ma jyotirgamaya\nWe have to emerge from darkness and enter into light. We emerged from our mother’s womb by breaking through the darkness, to see the light in this world. However, after coming onto this earth, we are falling back into “darkness.” Which kind of darkness? We are falling into the darkness of ignorance. We are falling into the darkness of selfishness and the darkness of hypocrisy. We are falling into the darkness of attachment and the darkness of cheating others. We must come to the light from this darkness. “I only care about my happiness, my selfish motives, I don’t care about what happens to others,” this is Dhruthrashtra’s instinct. This instinct should subside within us. “I have to enjoy others’ wealth as well. I should drive away everyone and enjoy everything alone”, this is Dhruthrashtra’s instinct. We should come out of this darkness into light. The purpose of Bhagavad Gita is to take us towards light, to mentor us in such a way that we can happily enjoy being in the light. That is why, as we must rise from our current stage, Bhagavad Gita starts by mentioning Dhruthrashtra. We should introspect what this stage is like. We can understand through the first verse.\nIn the first verse, Dhruthrashtra asks Sanjaya...\ndharma kshethre kurukshethre samavetha yuyuthsavaha |\nmamakah pandavas chaiva kim akurvatha sanjaya! ||\n“Hey Sanjaya, with the intention of waging war, Pandu’s sons, Pandavas, and my sons, Kauravas, have assembled at Kurukshetra.” “It is dharmakshetra, a land where righteousness flourishes. Did they behave accordingly?”\nkim akurvatha\nHe asked, “What did they do?” We can understand his selfish nature by the way he segregated the progeny (into his sons vs Pandu’s sons).\nMamakaha\nWith one word, ‘my’ people, Dhruthrashtra showed favoritism to his 100 sons.\nPandavaschaiva\nOthers, Pandavas as well, as if not even wanting to consider them.\nActually, he shouldn’t speak like that. They are his brother Pandu’s sons. They are also like his sons, right! He should have asked, “What did all our people do?” Saying ‘mamakaha’, he hugged his 100 sons with his possessive hands and turned away from the rest (Pandavas). It’s clear that he was disassociating himself from Pandavas. Saying “pandavascha,” he turned his face away and rejected them.\nWhat was the result? From among those that this blind and wicked person hugged, not a single person survived. Everyone perished, alas. What do we learn from this? We should not become recipients of vicious people’s love. Never reach a state where a malicious person thinks of you as their own. If they look at us and say ‘you are also in our team’ – that’s it, we will be finished. If he puts one of his hands on our shoulder, we also will turn into ashes. That’s why, don’t try to earn their favor or love. This is what the first sloka tells us.\nMamakaha – not one survived.\nPandavaschaiva – rejected by Dhruthrashtra, at least these five, Pandavas, survived.\nEven if bad people spurn us, it’s for our own good. It means we are fortunate to be on this earth for some more time, we will be alive for some more time. That’s why all five Pandavas survived happily without excessive danger.\nStay away from evil people. This is what we learn from Dhruthrashtra’s example. From a different angle, there is a great man who thought Pandavas as mama pranaha (my life). That was Sri Krishna. When Sri Krishna took the role of a peace messenger, Kauravas readied their houses, hoping He might visit. Instead, Sri Krishna went to Vidura’s home, ate banana peels and then went on His way. Duryodhana got angry. So, he planned to insult Sri Krishna. He ordered that no one should stand in honor of Sri Krishna. They asked, “How can we stay like that, disrespecting Sri Krishna?” He responded, “Don’t even look at the entrance to the assembly hall. Only look at me, and do whatever I do.” Everyone in the assembly agreed. They stayed focused on Duryodhana instead of the doorway through which Sri Krishna would enter. As soon as Sri Krishna stepped inside, Duryodhana, who was sitting on his throne, as if out of reflex, rose upon seeing Lord - with folded hands, he bowed his head. Since Duryodhana ordered everyone to copy him, everyone also stood up, expressed ‘Namaste’ with folded hands, and bowed their heads. “Hmm, the whole plan was wasted,” thought Duryodhana. Thus, he decided to insult Sri Krishna at least with his words. With this intention, he asked Sri Krishna, “You came with a message. When you come to us with some work, shouldn’t you accept our hospitality? Instead you went elsewhere!”\nKimardham vrushala bhojanam?\n“I thought you had big eyes. Your name is Pundarikaksha (one with wide, lotus-like eyes). Did you become blind?” “We are all standing in front of our houses to welcome you with purnakumbhas (welcoming pots of water).” “You ignored all of us and went to that Vrushala’s (Vidura’s) house. Why did you go and dine there?”\nIf He was really on a peace mission, Sri Krishna should have simply said, “He is a friend. I was here anyway. So, I thought I would visit him too. He pleaded with me to eat, so I ate there.” If He had said this, it would have been fine. However, Sri Krishna didn’t say that. He told Duryodhana “Don’t you know at least this much about politics? You call yourself a king?! Only in name! Don’t you even know this simple rule?” “In an enemy’s house, we shouldn’t even drink water, do you know why?” “While offering milk to your enemy with love and good intention, if he dies for some unrelated reason, people will blame you, thinking you poisoned him. Thus, you should never be hospitable to your enemy.” “Don’t you even know this standard? That’s why I didn’t come to your house. I went to Vidura’s home, ate there and came here.”\nDuryodhana became very angry. Duryodhana asked, “Are we your enemies?”\npandavan dvishase rajan\nSri Krishna asked “Hey Duryodhana, do you hate Pandavas?”\nDuryodhana responded, ”Yes. Pandavas are my cousins. There is property commonly inherited by us, about which we may have some differences. Such fights are common between brothers.” “However, what is the enmity between You and us? Why are you calling us your enemies?”\ndvishadannam na bhokthavyam dvisham chaiva na bhojayeth\nSri Krishna told Duryodhana, “You should not go to the enemy’s house or eat there. You shouldn’t offer food to the enemy.” Duryodhana said “What is the enmity between us?” Sri Krishna responds...\npandavan dvishase rajan\nyou hate Pandavas.\nDuryodhana says, “So! What’s wrong? We already told you why.”\nSri Krishna replies...\nmama pranahi pandava\nthe 5 Pandavas are my pancha pranas, five life forces.\n“If one says he loves a person but hates his pranas, that’s considered madness. Pandavas are my pranas.” Saying so, Sri Krishna included all five Pandavas as his own. That’s why, Pandavas are regarded as...\nkrushna nadhascha pandavaha\nowned by Sri Krishna.\nkrushna pranaha\nthey are His life.\nFor Pandavas, Sri Krishna is everything. He is their life. He is their master. They comply by His orders. Pandavas thought, “We know nothing other than Sri Krishna.” They were great, blessed, to think like that. They were recipients of Sri Krishna’s love.\nThus, if you become a recipient of a good person’s love, you will be uplifted. Even if it requires great effort, behave in a way that a good person can think of you as his own. Don’t conduct yourself in a way that a good person thinks of you to be different from him. Sri Krishna told Kauravas, “You are my enemies.” Not one of them survived. That’s why, don’t conduct yourself in a way that good people talk to you harshly. Behave in a way that they love you. Their love should become our home. This is termed, ‘abhimana vasathi.’ If their love becomes our home and we live in it, it becomes a safe haven for us.\nWe learn this from Dhruthrashtra’s attitude in the first sloka, ‘mamakaha pandavaha’. Dhruthrashtra embraced his 100 sons and became the reason for their end. He rejected Pandavas, and hence, they lived happily. Try to earn the love of good people. If bad people reject you, consider it a blessing and live happily. This is what’s conveyed by the first sloka, verse of Bhagavad Gita. Dhruthrashtra’s selfish nature becomes obvious with this sloka. Dhruthrashtra thus questioned Sanjaya. Whatever Sanjaya responds, is the rest of Bhagavad Gita’s instruction.\nSanjaya said, “O king, your question - how did everyone react? Bhishma fell injured? Did they just stand there? Doing nothing at all?” “No one imagined Bhishma being vanquished on the battlefield! You want to know what they were doing, right? Well, let me tell you.” “Where do I begin? Since you’re enquiring, let me narrate from the outset of the war..” “Everyone, Pandavas and Kauravas, came to the battlefield with their armies. Both Pandavas and Kauravas planned their vyuhas (war formations).” “When your son, Duryodhana, saw Pandavas’ tactical maneuvers, he became petrified. Let me tell you what he did then.” Saying so, Sanjaya starts recounting from the first day. Let’s listen to what Sanjaya said.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

They can foresee things. However, the Kauravas' army lacks discipline because it is a conglomeration of kings and their troops from different regions. Therefore, each unit has individuality and ego, its own standards, and acts independently. No matter how many diverse battalions join forces, there should be only one unanimous commander systematically leading the entire army. All others should listen to him. However, in the Kauravas' army, no one seemed to conform to such discipline. They generally exercised free will.\nHowever, Pandavas' army is different. The commander of the Pandavas' army is Dhrishtadyumna, who always followed instructions given by Sri Krishna. Hence, all members of his army strictly obey his orders. The commander of the Kauravas' army is the great grandsire, Bhishma, an eligible, intelligent, disciplined, capable, grand, and invincible warrior... but his instructions should be obeyed by all the army members, isn’t it? The Kauravas' army was 11 akshauhini in size, while the Pandavas' was only 7 akshauhini. Despite this, the Kauravas felt that the Pandavas' army was much larger because of the vyuhas (tactical army formations) they deployed.\nWe are mostly familiar with Padma Vyuham, used for capturing Abhimanyu. There are many more vyuhas like Garuda Vyuham, an army formation resembling an eagle ready to fly with outspread wings, and Suchi Vyuham, an army formation resembling a swiftly piercing needle. Therefore, vyuhas are indications of an army’s strike strategy. The Pandavas, with their intelligence, followed a clever strategy in army formations such that their army appears larger than it actually is. It seems the Kauravas' strategy was not effective. This is true. The Kauravas' army was struck with fear as soon as they saw the Pandavas' army.\nThis is expressed clearly from Sanjaya’s description. That is the beauty of Sanskrit. Each letter delivers a specific emotion. People often discount the importance of language. No! The beauty of the language comes from each letter of the language. For example, ‘thu’ is a beautiful letter. Amara Kosam clearly explains how the preceding word changes following the word that ends with ‘thu’.\nthu antha; adha adi\nadha indicates the beginning of a new scene.\n‘Thu’ at the end of a word indicates the beginning of a new scene, disconnecting the word from the previous scene. Sanjaya narrated ‘Drushtva: thu’, meaning “as soon as he saw,” implying “it’s already over.” As soon as he saw it, Duryodhana got scared! What did he see?\npandavani:kam\nthe war formations of Pandavas.\nHow was it?\nvyu:dam\nwith a variety of different formations.\nduryodhanas thada:\nSanjaya asked, “Do you know what Duryodhana did then?”\nacharyam-upasangamya\nhe dismounted from his chariot and raced to his guru. (What a visual Sanjaya created with words!)\nIt is good to approach a Guru, but how should one do it?\nvinitha vesho praveshtavyaha\nvinitha veshena praveshtavyaha asrama padaninama\npraveshtavyaniha asrama padaninama\n(from the great poet, Kalidasa)\nWhen visiting Elders, wise ones, we should be humble, without pride and false ego. “However, your son (Duryodhana) was not that way.”\nraja vacanam-abravith\nhe referred to himself as Raja (King), not mentioning his own name. He simply introduced himself as what he wanted to be addressed as. How does he want to be addressed? Duryodhana likes to be called “raraju” (king of kings). Even more, the current king, Dhruthrashtra, likes to call his son raraju! Dhruthrashtra was still the king. Duryodhana was not crowned as King yet. However, he declared himself King and started acting as one! He announced Karna as King for Anga Desam despite lacking any declarative authority. Just as a baby is covered in amniotic fluid, Dhruthrashtra’s eyes, mind, and brain were masked by love for his son. Thus, he accepted everything Duryodhana did, without question. Otherwise, Duryodhana would threaten Dhruthrashtra with suicide. Because of the fear resulting from immense affection towards his son, Dhruthrashtra would yield to his son.\nDhruthrashtra also wanted his son, Duryodhana, to become King and so, kept calling him “raraju.” Sanjaya warned Dhruthrashtra, “Your son, Duryodhana, whom you think of as ‘raraju’, is full of pride because he was fed by your intention of seeing him as king.”\nacharyam-upasangamyaha\nDuryodhana approached Guru Dronacharya.\nDronacharya is Guru for both Pandavas and Kauravas, training them in weaponry.\nWhenever a human experiences sorrow, fear, or predicament, he or she must visit a Guru’s abode. This is a fundamental principle. However, there is a process for approaching a Guru. Vedas define that process.\nsa guru mevadhi gaccheth\nwe should visit a Guru with inquisitiveness, as a seeker with humility, without hidden expectations.\nraja vacanam-abravith\nhowever, Duryodhana visited with pride thinking himself as a king.\nWhat did he do after reaching? Duryodhana started speaking. However, we will never find Duryodhana uvacha (said by Duryodhana, aka Suyodhana) in Bhagavad Gita. Why? It is not good to even think or utter certain names! Some people, we do not call by name out of respect. Others, we do not call by name out of fear. Still others, we do not call by name because we might become attached to their sins. Thus, Duryodhana is not mentioned by name anywhere in Bhagavad Gita, so that the tongue does not get influenced by bad instincts. Starting from the 3rd verse, “pasyaitam pandu puthranam” was actually said by Duryodhana.\nDuryodhana approached his Guru, bowed unto him and said...\npasya etha:n pa:ndu puthra:na:m a:cha:rya mahathi:m chamu:m |\nvyu:dda:m drupada puthre:na thava sishye:na dhi:matha:\nThe surface level meaning of this verse is different from what is hidden within. Each word Duryodhana used in this verse is to find faults in his Guru. Instead of serving his Guru or expressing his doubt, Duryodhana started pinpointing faults of his Guru. First, he says...\npasya...ethan chamum acharya mahathim pasya\nOh Guruji, look at that great army!\nvyu:ddam drupada puthre:na\nhow awesome, the strategy planned by Drupada’s son, Dhrishtadyumna, is.\nWho is he?\nthava sishye:na\nhe is also your sishya (student).\ndhimatha:\nhe is highly intelligent, see how well he has planned.\nThis is what we understand at the surface. However, he did not stop there. He began provoking his Guru with sarcastic words. Rather than taking blessings from his Guru at this point, Duryodhana humiliated and abused him, causing sorrow. How? We will learn that in the next sessions.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus,\nBhagavad Gita is a monumental scripture clearly depicting human psychology.1 This is explicitly seen in the way Sanjaya describes the circumstances when responding to Dhruthrashtra's questions. Sanjaya explains to Dhruthrashtra, “Your son, Duryodhana, was scared as soon as he saw the Pandavas' army. He immediately ran towards his guru, Dronacharya.” Duryodhana should actually have approached the commander-in-chief of the Kauravas' army, Bhishmacharya. Instead he approached Dronacharya.\nWhen approaching a Guru, one must be humble to seek advice or blessings. Instead he exhibited his rajasik, arrogant attitude. He could have at least spoken in a way that either assures the Guru or sought his encouragement. However, Duryodhana spoke in a way that humiliated his Guru and hurt his feelings. We notice this in the way he spoke in the third verse.\npasya etham pandu puthranam\nacharya! mahathim chamum\nacharya\nHey Dronacharya!\npasya\nLook!\n“Are you seeing or not? You have come to the battlefield to see. Look there!” Duryodhana uses a demanding tone with his Guru, asking whether he is looking at ‘that’ side. He starts by saying, “Look at that side, have you lost your sight?” pasya! Even friends get irritated when one uses this sort of tone. Duryodhana used this tone with his Guru, Dronacharya.\nHe points toward the opponent’s army and says, ‘etham mahathim chamum.’ These are very beautiful words. etham means that which is close; tham means that which is far. However, he said...\nchamum etham\nthis army\nHe felt the opposing army was close, bearing down on him.\nbhithasya nunam, bhayakari sarvam\nWhen a person is in fear, everything around scares him.\nThat day, Duryodhana was in a state where anything he saw was frightening. He felt that the entire opponent’s army was attacking him.\npasya etham\nLook at this army.\n“Look at this army that is about to attack me! Whose army is this?”\npandu puthranam\narmy of Pandavas.\nLook at it! How is it?\nmahathim chamum\nOh my, such a huge, great army.\nWe know how big the army is. Kauravas had 11 akshauhini (1 akshauhini consists of 21,870 chariots, 21,870 elephants, 65,610 horses and 109,350 infantry) and Pandavas' only had 7 akshauhini. However, it was quite astonishing to see the vyuhas, tactical army formations, used by the 7 akshauhini. Vyudam! We already discussed that vyuhas have specific names.\npadma vyuham, sakata vyuham, suchi vyuham, varaha vyuham .\nVaraha Vyuham shows that it is ready to pounce and crush the opposing army. Sakata Vyuham warns that the army will crush the opponents under a cart’s wheels. Each vyuham conveys a different message to the opponent. Padma Vyuham is arranged to declare that it is impossible to exit for anyone entering the vyuham. Suchi Vyuham conveys that opponents cannot prevent penetration of their zone, no matter how hard they try. Each vyuham indicates a specific goal.\nacharya\nHey Dronacharya.\nvyudam dhrupada puthrena\nDo you know who planned all these tactical war formations? The son of Drupada.\nWhose name should he actually be referring to here? He should be using the name of the person, the commander-in-chief of the opponent’s army, Dhrishtadyumna. However, he refers to him as Drupada's son instead. This was meant to humiliate his Guru, Dronacharya. How?\nDrupada, the king of Panchala, and Dronacharya were childhood classmates. Generally, after graduation, childhood friends make vows to help each other anytime, sharing joys and sorrows with each other always. While returning to their homes after finishing their studies, Drupada and Drona also did the same, promising each other to help when needed. As he was the prince, Drupada went on to become the Panchala king. However, Drona was a poor Brahmin unable to meet his family needs.2 Dronacharya loved his son, Ashwatthama, tremendously.3 He was saddened for not even being able to feed him milk due to his poverty-stricken situation. Dronacharya thought of taking help from someone, remembered Drupada's promise to help and reached out. However, Drupada behaved as if he never knew him. Dronacharya was angered with Drupada because he showed no value for friendship - he made false promises as though they were words written on sand, ready to be erased.4 He took an oath to teach him a lesson. He planned to train someone in his primary skill, archery, and humiliate Drupada via this student. He wanted to prove himself. In that search, he visited Pandavas, trained them with the necessary skills to be great warriors. After completing training, all the students wanted to offer whatever Guru wished for as Guru Dakshina, an offering out of gratitude. Both Kauravas and Pandavas stood in front of their master, Dronacharya, and asked him what they could offer as Guru Dakshina.\nDronacharya said that he wanted his students to defeat King Drupada, tie him up and place him at his (Drona's) feet. All the other students were shocked after hearing this and backed out, but Arjuna said he would do what his Guru wished for. Arjuna fought with Drupada, won, and tied him to his chariot, placing him at the feet of his Guru, Dronacharya. As he was a king, after being humiliated like this, Drupada got upset and performed intense penance. He was blessed with two children, a girl and a boy, who could kill Dronacharya after performing a yajna, a ritual with an objective. Draupadi and Dhrishtadyumna were both born to him that way. The reason for their birth was to kill Dronacharya.\nDuryodhana says, “Hey acharya, knowing that Dhrishtadyumna was born to kill you, you made him your student. You knew that training him would be harmful to you.” “Despite that, what did you do?”\ndrupada puthrena thava sishye:na\nyou made him your student.\nHe said to his acharya, “Were you out of your mind? Would any normal person train a student to be a warrior despite knowing that the student would kill the teacher in the future?” “As a boon for his penance, Drupada had a son with the strength to kill you.” “You picked him as a student and trained him in all skills, on par with Arjuna.” “Such a person is now the opponent’s chieftain. What did you expect to happen??”\n“You are our Guru. You have to protect us. However, the opponent’s army chief, who was also your student, was born to kill you.”\nthava sishye:na dhimatha:\nyou took him in as a student and thus, nicely sharpened his intellect.\nDid you train him to become brilliant or take him as your student because he was brilliant?\nWhen reversed, the order of the words give totally different meanings.\ndhimatha: sishye:na\nsishye:na dhimatha:\n“Despite knowing that he would kill you, you have trained him with many skills, sharpening his intellect.” “You gave him so many powerful weapons and taught him the secrets of war.” “We have such a (dumb) person, you on our team as acharya, what should we do now?” That was how Duryodhana expressed himself.\nDronacharya knew Drupada humiliated him after Drona sought his help. While training Drupada’s son, Drona was aware that the son was born to kill him. So, what was the need to bring up his name now? It wasn’t necessary. However, Duryodhana somehow wanted to hurt his Guru. Some people are sadists.5 They poke another person and enjoy the resulting pain. It’s their nature. This was probably natural for Duryodhana. He started by hurting Dronacharya, using humiliating, harsh words.\nDuryodhana did not stop with this, but continued to further hurt his Guru. We must study his words carefully to understand how he was crushing his Guru’s heart. Let’s keep this in mind as we move further.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus,\nBhagavad Gita is a flow of knowledge which can purify even the Ganga River. Shedding light on our own personalities and inherent natures, Gita provides us with all the essential sadhanas (means) to reform and refine them for a purposeful life. Bhagavad Gita is an elixir, a divine message, from Sri Krishna.\nHe revealed this directly to Arjuna on the battlefield. Aside from Arjuna, no one else on the battlefield heard. However, Sanjaya was able to listen later due to the boon from sage Veda Vyasa. One should reveal knowledge only when requested. Hence, only when Dhruthrashtra asked Sanjaya on the 11th day of war, “What happened on the battlefield?”, Sanjaya revealed the entire divine message. Thus, the divine message has been spreading across the entire world since then, ultimately reaching us.\nWe should be mindful and watch ourselves when around Elders, the wise. We have to follow etiquette while sitting, walking or talking to them, or else one could be in trouble. Sanjaya was very much aware of this etiquette. Hence, though he could view the events in the battlefield, he revealed the incidents only after King Dhruthrashtra commanded him to do so 11 days after the war began. He disclosed the events lucidly without any shortcomings. Had Dhruthrashtra been sensible, after listening to Sanjaya, he would have stopped the war. He would have counseled his sons, Kauravas, to reconcile with Pandavas and give them what they requested. He would have instructed his sons to lead their own lives, however, Dhruthrashtra was blind in all aspects.\nHe was not only blind physically, but also ‘in the mind’ (manas). Hence, he was not able to provide essential guidance to his own children. As a result, he lost everyone. The first chapter of Srimad Bhagavad Gita is titled “Arjuna Vishada Yoga.” In fact, it was not only Arjuna who experienced grief in this chapter. Dhruthrashtra and Duryodhana also experienced anguish. However, It is only Arjuna’s sorrow that is taken as a means to become a better person. It is natural for anyone to experience distress. Bhagavad Gita also teaches us what kind of behavior at these times paves a path to grow from them. Man is very ambitious with desires in life. He wants to achieve many things. He also strives tremendously to succeed. However, there is no rule that all efforts fructify, and that all desires are fulfilled.\nuthpathyanthe: vili:yanthe: daridranam manoratthaha\nthe endless ebb and flow of wishes and desires bring happiness when satisfied, and sorrow when not.\nMost of them are not fulfilled. Hence, one generally remains in sorrow for most of life. However, it is essential to know how to conduct oneself when in sorrow. If one genuinely wishes to have his wishes fulfilled, it is important to know how to respond, and conduct oneself when in tough situations to become a better person. Dhruthrashtra, Duryodhana and Arjuna were all sorrow-stricken. How did they react? That is what we need to understand.\nDhruthrashtra's sorrow was not beneficial to the world and cannot be considered as a proper means.\nDhruthrashtra was engulfed in deep sorrow upon hearing that Bhishma had fallen on the battlefield. He was shocked. He felt sad. When in sorrow, one should seek refuge in a well-wisher, who can give good advice, and then carry out those suggestions. In brief, this is what needs to be done. Dhruthrashtra approached Sanjaya while in sorrow. Sanjaya was a good person, his well-wisher. Hence, there is no flaw in Dhruthrashtra’s approach in seeking refuge from a fit person. However, the attitude of the seeker is key. He asked Sanjaya about the happenings on the battlefield. Sanjaya revealed the entire scenario without reservation. However, Sanjaya’s entire narration was akin to rainfall on a buffalo’s back. It had no effect - Dhruthrashtra was an unresponsive recipient. He did not grasp the advice. Therefore, the first chapter is named “Arjuna Visha:da Yoga,” not “Dhruthrashtra Visha:da Yoga.” Dhruthrashtra asked for advice, listened to it, but ultimately did not implement it. This is not acceptable. The attitude that allows one to seek guidance, listen to it, but completely refrain from exercising it is a result of tamo gunam, unresponsive attitude. Tamasic sorrow is detrimental to man’s welfare. We learn this from Dhruthrashtra’s vishada, sorrow.\nDuryodhana's sorrow was a result of his rajasic nature.\nNow, let’s analyze Duryodhana’s sorrow. Why would Duryodhana be sorrow-stricken? In fact, he should have been enthusiastic. Charged with eagerness to fight, Duryodhana should have been proud to display his valor and swordsmanship. We may question the genuineness of Duryodhana’s sorrow. Many were mistaken too. Great acharyas like Bhagavad Ramanujacharya, disciple of Yamunacharya, did not have such doubts. They clearly perceived the scenario and elucidated the same for our benefit. What was the state of Duryodhana? He was in an emotionally aggressive and sorrow-stricken state. He approached his guru for respite, which was the right thing to do. However, the inherent rajasic nature of Duryodhana made him use harsh words and behave disrespectfully towards his guru. This caused immense pain to his guru. He lacked even an iota of inclination to listen to his guru’s advice.\nCompared to Duryodhana, Dhruthrashtra was far better because he at least keenly listened to Sanjaya’s advice, though not implementing it. When Sanjaya said, “Hey King! That day when Pandavas blew their conches, the sound shattered (vyadarayath) the hearts of all your people, Kauravas.” There was no reaction from Dhruthrashtra. Dhruthrashtra just listened passively. Towards the end of the divine message, Sanjaya said, “Wherever there is Sri Krishna, Arjuna can’t act on his own. He will act only as per Sri Krishna’s will.” Though Arjuna was initially against fighting the battle, Sri Krishna motivated him to fight.\nyathra yo:ge:swara krushnaha yathra pa:rttho: dhanur dharaha\nSri Krishna made Arjuna pick up the bow which he earlier flung aside, and made him fight in the war.\nSanjaya said “Hence, Oh King!”\nthathrasri:hi\nprosperity will be with them only.\nthathra vijayaha\nthey alone will be victorious.\n...implying “your sons will lose everything. They will be defeated.” Could there be a more transparent way of conveying this message to the king? However, Dhruthrashtra simply shut off his brain. Sanjaya continued, “Listen to me. I am speaking the truth.”\nithi dhruvam\neven morality is on their side.\nbhuthihi\nall wealth will be on their side.\nHowever, Dhruthrashtra did not want to accept this advice. Sanjaya did not mince any words while advising him. He described the situation on the battlefield as it was because he was a hithaishi, a well-wisher.\nDuryodhana was worse than Dhruthrashtra. It is said, puthra dhicheth parajayam, the son exceeds his father in exhibiting atrocious behavior. Knowing that one must seek refuge in acharya in times of distress, sorrow-stricken Duryodhana approached his guru, Dronacharya, without delay.\nsa gurum evabhi gacheth\nWhat should one do after approaching? He should express his pain and agony and listen to the advice. After approaching his guru, he expressed his anguish without any reservations. He criticized his guru in all possible ways. However, he was not inclined to listen to even a single word of his guru’s advice. He left immediately without looking back. Is it so? When examining chapter 1 of Bhagavad Gita, we can understand. In chapter 1, Duryodhana spoke approximately 9 slokas (verses) with his guru Dronacharya. After all that, he commanded his guru...\nbhishma evabhi rakshanthu bhavantha sarva evahi\nbe vigilant and protect Bhishmacharya, don’t act on your own - all of you be attentive.\nHe then simply left. Is this the way to speak to a Guru? Do you plead for advice or order him? This is rajasic nature, a state of extreme rajasic behavior crossing all boundaries. He had to experience the fruits of it. The sorrow resulting from this rajasic nature made him extremely angry. We already spoke about this during previous episodes. In chapter 1 sloka 3, Duryodhana reminded his guru about his inimical relationship with Drupada. He spoke satirically, “See your disciple, Dhrishtadhyumna, who is now the commander-in-chief of Pandavas army.” “It is you who trained him to be a duty-bound, brave soldier. You imparted excellent skills of designing tactical army formations (vyuhas).” “Giving such knowledge to the person who is going to kill you is beyond my comprehension. You were so dumb to do that!” This is how he spoke to his guru. He did not stop there. He started identifying warriors on both sides. This is a recommended action. A capable commander identifies warriors and their strengths to prepare for battle.\nHowever, how must one do it? He singled out only 7 warriors from his own side in a disappointing tone. “That’s all”, he said.\nHowever, from the opponents, he identified almost 18 warriors, praising their capabilities. Did he really do that? Yes, he did.\nLet’s listen to what Duryodhana said in the upcoming sessions, beginning with the 4th verse.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus,\nBhagavad Gita provides a process to reform and enhance one’s innate personality and nature. That is why anyone, regardless of nationality, race, etc., can easily face any adversity, in any situation, at any time, with Bhagavad Gita. We are trying to understand how that works.\nThere are 3 categories of people. Some conduct themselves such that they don’t hurt others, and don’t get hurt. They are sattvic. A few others are focused only on getting their work done. They don’t care about others’ feelings. They are rajasic. The last category focuses only on destroying others regardless of their own fate. We call them tamasic. Be it sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic, if they are willing to take guidance from the wise, there is a chance that they can attain a good state. Bhagavad Gita showcases this truth to us.\nDhruthrashtra is tamasic. Duryodhana is rajasic. Arjuna, though rajasic by nature, has a greater proportion of sattvic nature within. Hence, he became a role model among his other contemporaries. We can understand this when studying chapter 1 in the prescribed manner. We discussed how the tamasic Dhruthrashtra fails in spite of approaching Sanjaya as he did not take the given advice.\nNow, we are trying to understand Duryodhana's arrogance and malice in chapter 1. Duryodhana is the crystallized form of rajasam. He was overwhelmed with sorrow. He needed a means to come out of it and thus, approached his guru. Seeking guidance, prostrating before his guru Drona, he was to receive apt guidance. However, Duryodhana forgot to pay obeisances. He even forgot what to ask for. Rather, he began to command his guru. He began exhibiting his own timid nature as well. Let us see how. We have discussed a few examples in previous sessions. To begin, he was terrified seeing the army in front of him. He started speaking offensively, hurting the feelings of his guru. Then, he started to identify prominent warriors from both sides. He cautioned his guru to be mindful of the presence of those warriors. He used this act of caution simply as an excuse to command his guru.\nIn the 4th sloka (verse), Duryodhana says...\nathra suraha mahesvasaha\nbhimarjuna sama yudhi\n“Hey Acharya! Do you see all those brave warriors present here in the Pandavas' army?”\nbhimarjuna samah yudhi\neach and every one is comparable to Bhima and Arjuna in strength.\nWhy is he mentioning only Bhima and Arjuna? As the saying goes, 'bhithasya nunam bhayakari sarvam'. As one inflicted with jaundice sees everything yellowish, one filled with fear is terrified with all his surroundings. Duryodhana is not afraid of anyone in the Pandava army. He is not afraid of Dharmaraja. He doesn’t care about Nakula and Sahadeva. He doesn’t consider the remaining Pandava army as actual warriors. However, he trembles with fear seeing these two warriors, Bhima and Arjuna. Why? Because these two took oaths. ‘Ka karnaha kka suyodhanaha’ – “I will put an end to both Karna and Suyodhana!”, pledged Arjuna. The valorous Bhimasena took a pledge to vanquish the entire Kaurava Army. Hence, Duryodhana was terrified of Bhima. He previously tried to kill Bhima many times, but each attempt was in vain. He poisoned Bhima's food, but it was easily digested. In another instance, he tried to drown Bhima, but Bhima survived and resurfaced. He placed Pandavas in a house of lac and set fire to it, but they safely escaped. He attempted to end Bhima’s life many times but was always unsuccessful. Hence, Duryodhana was scared of Bhima who pledged to eliminate the entire Kaurava army. He was afraid of Bhima and Arjuna.\nDue to that fear, whoever he saw from the Pandavas' army appeared to him like Bhima and Arjuna. This is what Duryodhana clearly confesses.\nathra suraha mahesvasaha\nall the warriors from the Pandavas' army.\nbhimarjuna samaha yudhi\nseem as great as Bhima and Arjuna.\nWas everyone as mighty as Bhima and Arjuna? No, but his mental state was such. He began counting the warriors on his side. This is a noteworthy quality of a leader. Being able to identify capable ones is a quality of the wise. However, if blown out of proportion, it becomes harmful. This is what he did. Let’s keep track of who he counted as a mighty warrior from the Pandava army.\nFirst, he mentions the commander-in-chief, Dhrishtadyumna, son of Drupada.\nLet’s count as each one is named.\nyuyudhanaha viratas cha drupadas cha maharathaha\nmaharathas (great warriors) Drupada, Virata, Yuyudhana (Satyaki).\n3 so far.\ndhrushtakethuhu chekitanaha kasirajas cha viryavan |\nDhrishtakethu, Chekitana, and the great warrior, Kasi Raja.\nThe total comes to 6.\npurujith kunthi bhojas cha saibyas cha narapungavaha ||\nthe good and noble Saibya, Purujith, Kunthi Bhoja.\nAdding 3 more, taking the total to 9.\nIncluding the commander-in-chief, this totals 10.\nyudhamanyus cha vikranthah authamaujas cha viryavan\nvalorous Yuddhamanyu, mighty Authamaujas, a very fierce opponent.\nAnother 2 warriors named here.\nsaubhadroha draupadeyahas cha\ngreat Abhimanyu, son of Subhadra, the five sons of Draupadi born to 5 Pandavas.\nThey are all very young children.\nHowever, he refers to all of them as ‘sarva evama:haratthaha’, great warriors. In fact, a maharathi is one who can defeat 10,000 warriors single-handedly. However, Draupadi’s children could not achieve this feat. Abhimanyu might be great, but Upa Pandavas (Draupadi’s sons - Prathivindhya, Shruthasoma, Shruthakeerthi, Shataneeka, and Shruthasena) were not that capable.\nHe identified 18 warriors and categorized all of them as maharathas. This shows how his fear tainted his perception. That’s okay, it’s good to identify others’ strengths. However, one shouldn’t look down on his own people. He should not discourage them. He should not insinuate and demean their bravery and swordsmanship. He should equally encourage and give them confidence. That is the true nature of a leader.\nThese days, we see many people advocating social service. Many times, they neglect their own family, pretending to serve society. Families become distressed, unhappy while these folks reach out to serve others. The earlier leaders of Bharat (India) ruled our country in that way. Current leadership has enabled us to at least take care of our own people first. Beginning with the education system that doesn’t let our children learn our own history, all of us are bereft of it. We think those who learn others’ version of history as great, we feel only those who respect foreigners are great. We have been brainwashed to take pride in leaving behind all our history and traditions. This was the mandate. We were subdued and oppressed all these years. This is not Equality. Duryodhana belongs to the same category.\nHence, while speaking to his guru, Dronacharya, Duryodhana says... “Hey Acharya! There are 18 of them excluding the five Pandavas.” If we add them as well, they total 23. Now, let me identify soldiers from our side.\nIn the 7th sloka (verse)...\nasmakam thu visistaha ye:\nthan nibodha dwijotthama! |\nnayaka mama sainyasya\nsamjartham than bravimi the:\n“Oh great acharya! We have remarkable warriors on our side as well!” “But alas, the ones in their army are greater.” “You were their instructor! And you are a Brahmin!” Apparently, according to Duryodhana, a Brahmin is one who only chants Vedas. “You are supposed to do only that, chant manthras.” “However, you have now come to fight a war! You became our acharya! What can we do? This is our fate!”\nYou might question, “Swamiji, what are you saying?! Did he really mean that?” Yes. Observe how he addressed his guru, Drona.\n‘than nibodha dwijotthama!’\n“Hey great one! I identified maharathas from their army, right? Let me tell you about my army too! Listen!”\nnayaka mama sainyasya\nHe could have said “our army.” Instead, he said, “my army.”\n“You may or may not remember them. Let me remind you.“\nThese words spoken by Duryodhana seem simple and straightforward. Yet, the underlying current of his words indicates contempt towards his acharya. However, he is compelled to show respect to Drona, an elder whom Bhishmacharya appointed. We will be surprised to see that he identified only 7 warriors as capable from his army. He says “There is no one else.” Really? Let’s see in the 8th sloka.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nWe are discussing Duryodhana's situation in Bhagavad Gita chapter one today. Duryodhana is symbolic of rajasic nature. However, when he saw the Pandava army, he felt sad and fearful. To overcome his fear, he went to his guru. He reminded his guru of all the heroes on the other side. He started mentioning the great warriors on his side of the army too. He mentioned 18 great warriors from the Pandava army, but on his side, he could not name beyond 7 people. In fact, the total Pandava army was only seven akshauhini, large units of soldiers 218,700 not including the charioteers and large number of chariots, horses and elephants. The Kauravas army was eleven akshauhini.1 From seven akshauhini, he could point out twenty-three great warriors. However, from his eleven akshauhini, he could not count beyond seven.\nLet us see who they are.\nStarting with chapter 1, verse 8.\n\nSLOKA WORD - bhava:n bhi:shmas cha karnas cha krupas cha samithinjayaha | aswattha:ma: vikarnas cha2 saumadaththi: thatthaiva cha ||\nSLOKA MEANING - (On our side are) yourself, and Bhishma, and Karna, and Kripa (who is) ever-victorious in battle, and also Ashwatthama, Vikarna, and Saumadatti.\nFull stop. He stopped there saying ‘thatthaiva cha’, which means ‘that is it’. Who all? He said “Bhavan – first you, oh Dronacharya!” bhi:shmascha: - my grandfather, Karnascha - who is my life, Equivalent to my brother krupascha: samitinjayha: - the one who is well experienced in battlefield, the great Kripacharya Aswattha:ma: - your son vikarnascha: - my brother In reality, Vikarna was a good person. Amongst the hundred brothers, Vikarna was the only one who openly spoke out against his brother’s evil deeds. However, it was of no use. All the other brothers asked him to stay silent, “You are young, be quiet and refrain from giving advice.” This was during Draupadi's incident. He said “soumadatthihi: thatthaiva:” then Saumadatta and that is all. He did not stop there. What he said further upset his teacher even more.\n\nSLOKA WORD - anye: cha bahavas su:ra:ha madartthe: thyaktha ji:vitha:ha | na:na: sasthra praharana:ha sarve: yuddha visa:rada:ha ||\nSLOKA MEANING - And many other heroes have come to sacrifice their lives for me; they are all well-versed in warfare and equipped with various weapons.\nThese words sound good, but we need to understand the intent. anye:cha bahava suraha: there are so many to count but none worth recognizing by name. That is still fine, but the way Duryodhana saw them is more significant. madarthe: thyaktha ji:vithaha: they sacrificed their lives for me. They sacrificed their lives implying they looked like dead bodies to him. They looked lifeless to him, they all seemed dead to him. Can we say so?! People proudly declare, “He is ready to sacrifice his life for me!” We say one is ready to sacrifice his life, but can we say he is equivalent to a dead body? What Duryodhana said was thyaktha ji:vithaha - thyaktha means that which has left. It is used in the past tense. Is it wrong? It is not about what is wrong, it is about the usage. He could have said it better as “They are ready to sacrifice their lives for me.” Wouldn’t the verse sound bad if we change it? Our great poets know how to phrase it in a better way. It could have been phrased as madarthe: thyukthumudyathaha:. This way, it would have not disturbed the flow of the verse and would have been auspicious too. Even before the battle started, he spoke in inauspicious terms like someone saying inappropriate words at a very auspicious time. madarthe: thyaktha je:vithaha. Not only this, he said something else…\nna:na: sasthra praharana:ha: all of them knew how to use various weapons but no one was expert at using one as we say “jack of all trades”. When someone has many skills without expertise in a particular one, he is termed as a ‘jack of all trades but master of none’. Intending the same, he said all his warriors were like that. Each Pandava was an expert in using a particular weapon and could fight independently and efficiently. Bhima had different skills, Dharmaraja different, Arjuna different, Nakula in something else and Sahadeva in yet another one. One was an expert in sword fighting, another in archery, one knew how to use gadha (mace), while another other knew how to use musalam. Their expertise was so great that no one could defeat them at their skill. Pandavas were experts. However, in case of Kauravas, he said...\nna:na: sastrapraharnaha: they simply know how to use all the weapons. He continued saying as if to sound a bit positive... sarve: yudhavisa:rada:ha: everyone knows a little about warfare. All these inauspicious words came involuntarily out of Duryodhana’s mouth indicating his sorrow and arrogance. He used another set of words, denoted in chapter 1 verse 10.\n\nSLOKA WORD - aparya:ptham thad asmakam balam bhi:shma:bhi rakshitham | parya:ptham thwidam e:the:sha:m balam bhi:ma:bhi:rakshitham ||\nSLOKA MEANING - That army of ours, protected by Bhishma, seems inadequate, while this army of theirs, protected by Bhima, appears sufficient (to defeat us).\nThese words are really surprising. “Oh teacher, you have heard all this.” thath means so thasma:th ka:rana:th because of the reasons I told you till now asma:kambalam apariya:ptham the army we have is apariya:ptham, not adequate. We have a shortage of troops. Many people are confused with this word, apariya:ptham. People think apariya:ptham means abundant. Sanskrit does not define it that way. Apariya:ptham means ‘it is not enough, it is not efficient’. Why? bhi:shma:bhirakshitham because Bhishma is leading. “Although we are an army of eleven akshauhini, I feel it not sufficient because Bhishma is leading.” However...\npariya:ptham thvidhamethe:sha:m balam – he says ethe:sham which means it is these people’s. Idham means this. It refers to something near. Ethe:sha:m refers to people who are around him. The:sha:m or thath is used to refer to someone far away. However, he did not say the:sha:m or thath (he said e:the:sha:m meaning people who are around him). He felt that his army was far away and that the opponent’s army was sitting right on top of his head. pariya:ptham thu idham this army e:the:sha:m balam the power of these Pandavas. Pariya:ptham means it is enough to kill us. How? bhi:ma:bhirakshitham because it is protected by Bhima. We need to observe this very carefully. When we compare a person on one side with the one on other side, both should have the same capability and should be of the same level. For example, when a prime minister visits another country, the PM of that country receives him. Similarly, a foreign minister is received by his counterpart in another country. The same protocol applies to a Secretary or under secretary. In brief, when a person of a certain level visits another country, he will be received by a person of similar level even though he can meet others. Because Bhishma was commander of Duryodhana’s army, he felt the army on his side was not capable enough. Whereas on the other side, Bhima was commander. So he felt that side had the capacity to defeat his army. He compared Bhishma to Bhima. Is this fair? Here the words thath, apariya:ptham and pariya:ptham are crucial. Also, comparing Bhishma and Bhima is very significant. We have discussed apariya:ptham, pariya:ptham and thath. However, why is he comparing Bhishma from his side with Bhima from their side? Is it because he was the commander-in-chief? No. Dhrishtadyumna was commander of Pandavas army, not Bhima. Is it because he was the eldest? No, Dharmaraja was the eldest of the brothers, not Bhima. Or is it because he was the chief advisor for the entire army? No. That was Sri Krishna for Pandavas, not Bhima. Or is it because he was a renowned and efficient fighter? That was Arjuna, not Bhima. Then why did he consider Bhima to be fit for this comparison? Because all he could think of were the two oaths. Nothing else. One by Bhishma from his side and another by Bhima on the other side. What were they? Bhishma declared that if he had to lead the Kaurava army, they would have to respect his oath. His oath was that he would not directly attack any of the Pandavas brothers. Then why be the commander? He mentioned that he would fight anyone else. Karna immediately reacted stating that they will fight the five Pandavas and that Bhishma should take care of the rest. He asked, “Will you fight the rest?” Bhishma replied “except for Pandavas, I will fight and kill the rest of the army,” For which Karna gave assurance to Duryodhana that he will fight and kill Pandavas. Therefore, the commander-in-chief of Kauravas, Bhishma, will not harm Pandavas. Bhima’s oath was that he will not spare anyone from the Kaurava army. Thus, Duryodhana could only see Bhima from Pandavas and Bhishmacharya from Kauravas. That is why he compared both and expressed his opinion to Drona. This incident describes Duryodhana’s fear. We will also discuss how he continued to express his fright.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhulara,\nThe words in Bhagavad Gita may sound simple. However, when learning from Elders, one can understand the intended original tattvam (in-depth nature). Bhagavad Gita is God’s upadesam (divine message). If one desires His grace, one needs to worship its physical form, the scripture, with utmost respect. Such worship allows the devata (celestial being) that embodies the scripture, to respond by revealing the meaning to the seeker. That is why in the olden days, the respective scriptures were also worshipped daily along with worshipping archamurthi, the deity form of the Lord. Scriptures were not looked at as mere books, but were treated as worthy of worship. Why? Because only scripture can explain the meaning of these words, and the corresponding devata embodying the scripture can bless seekers.\nOur forefathers thus worshipped scriptures and bestowed their meanings to us. We are trying to understand them, bit-by-bit. Our forefathers put tremendous effort in learning them. We have the opportunity to learn without such immense efforts. We are trying to examine a few aspects of chapter one discussing Duryodhana's grief. Duryodhana was frightened to see Bhishma in his army and Bhima in the rival army. We know the reason. Bhishmacharya says that if Sri Krishna was not part of the rival army, then he could fight very well and destroy the entire army. However, why wouldn’t Sri Krishna be in the army on the other side? This is either Bhishma's weakness or devotion towards Sri Krishna, or love towards his people (Pandavas). It could be any reason, but the bottom line is that he would not harm Pandavas.\nsaktho:ham dhanushe:ke:na nihanthum sarva pa:ndava:n\nI can defeat all Pandavas without even adjusting my bow\nsaktho:ham dhanusha: e:ke:na - nihanthum sarva pa:ndava:n\n...only in the absence of Sri Maha Vishnu, the root cause of the entire existence, now in the form of Sri Krishna. Duryodhana thinks this is the weakness of his chieftain, Bhishma. Seeing Bhima in the rival army... Duryodhana remembers Bhima’s vow after Draupadi was disrespectfully dragged to the assembly.. What was the vow?\nmadhna:mi kaurava satham samare:na ko:pa:th\ndussa:sanasya rudhiram na pibha:mi urastha:ha\nsanchu:rnaya:mi gadaya: na suyodhanu:ruhu\nsandhim karo:thu bhavatha:m nrupathih pane:na\nThe elder brother is sending Sri Krishna to mediate, the other brothers are talking about a peaceful resolution - but Bhima says...\nsandhim karo:thu nrupathihi – let them try to negotiate\nDo you know what I will do?\nmadhna:mi kaurava satham samare: ko:pa:th\nI will crush all Kauravas into powder with my mace\ndussa:sanasya rudhiram na pibha:m urastha:th\nI will rip open Dussasana’s chest and bathe with his blood\nsanchu:rnaya:mi gadaya: suyodhanu:ruhu\nI will crush the thigh of Suyodhana who asked Draupadi to sit on it\nIf I don’t do this, then Sri Krishna can go and negotiate with them. This meant that he intended to definitely do everything he declared. He did not stop there.\nBhima told Draupadi on the same day in the assembly...\nchanchatbhujabhramitha chanda gada:bhi ga:tha sanchu:rnitho:yugalasya suyo:dhanasya\nI will break the thighs of the evil person with my whirling mace\nsthyana:vamushti ghana so:nitha so:na pa:nihi uttam sayishyathi kacha:n tava de:vi bhi:maha\nBhima said to Draupadi that he would massage her hair with the blood of Dussasana’s chest.\nEven after 13 years, these words were echoing in Duryodhana’s ears as if they were just uttered.\nSo, everyone in his army looked like Bhishma, who would not fight.\nEveryone in the rival army looked like Bhima, as if they were ready to take his life..\nThus, Duryodhana, out of fear, approached Dronacharya and expressed himself in many ways. Finally, he says in the 11th verse...\n\nSLOKA WORD - ayane:shu: cha sarve:shu yattha: bha:gam avastthitha:ha | bhi:shmam e:va:bhi rakshanthu bhavanthas sarva e:va hi ||\nSLOKA MEANING - (Therefore) let all of you, positioned in your respective divisions, protect Bhishma alone.\nDuryodhana feels if Bhishma alone can be protected, that’s enough. He tells Dronacharya to keep aside other thoughts and tasks, and simply protect Bhishma from all directions. Is he the one to tell Drona? Dronacharya is the one who taught Duryodhana the basics of everything, including how to hold a bow and arrow. However, Duryodhana is commanding Drona on what to do and how to protect Bhishma. What could Drona do? It wasn’t the right time to correct him in the battlefield. It’s not the time to demotivate or depress anyone in this war. Therefore, poor Dronacharya did not speak up, feeling despondent at the stupidity of Duryodhana. A series of verses from the first chapter depict the cowardly state of Duryodhana. This carried through for almost 9 verses in the first chapter where he displayed cowardice while expressing fear to Dronacharya. Bhishma was also listening to this, and observing the state of Dronacharya and Duryodhana. What could he do? Bhishma felt that if the leader is demotivated then the whole army will be demotivated as well. So he felt the responsibility of rejuvenating and building Duryodhana’s confidence. We can observe this in Sanjaya’s words in the 12th verse.\n\nSLOKA WORD - thasya sanjanayan harsham kuru vruddhah pitha:mahaha | simha na:dam vinadyo:chchaihi sankham dadhmau pratha:pava:n ||\nSLOKA MEANING - In order to cheer him, the oldest among the Kurus, the magnificent patriarch Bhishma, roared like a lion and sounded his conch loudly.\nHe sounded the conch at a very high pitch. Why?\nthasya duryo:dhanasya sanjanayan harsham\nthere is no happiness on his face or enthusiasm in him; if I don’t energize him, things will spiral out of control\nsanjanayan harsham\nthere was a need to inspire and energize him\nThis is what he did. Thus, we understand that Duryodhana, symbolic of a highly rajasic personality, was undergoing grief. When one experiences grief, one must approach Elders. He approached Drona. One must express his current state. He did. One must listen to advice given. However, he didn’t like it or follow it. This is a sign of his immense pride and ego. That is why Elders did not name the first chapter after the grief of Dhrtarastra or or Duryodhana. It was not named Suyodhana Vishada Yogaha or Duryodhana Vishada Yogaha Prathamodhyayaha. Instead, they named it, Arjuna Vishada Yogaha.\nNow, let’s examine the state of Kauravas and the discipline in Pandavas. When Bhishma sounded his conch, the rest of Kauravas had no clue of what was happening in their army. One may question how we can claim this. Let’s listen to 13th verse -\nthathaha\nas Bhishma sounded the conch\n\nSLOKA WORD - thathas sankha:s cha bhe:ryas cha panava:naka go:mukha:ha | sahasaiva:bhya-hanyantha sa sabdas thumulo::bhavath ||\nSLOKA MEANING - Then, conches, drums, kettle-drums, and horns suddenly blared forth, and that sound was a great tumult.\nEveryone randomly sounded their conches, causing chaos, no one knew where everyone was or what was happening.\nthumula abhavath\nThis indicates a lack of discipline in Kauravas. 11 akshauhinis of army, but there was no discipline. Though Bhishma was on their side to rejuvenate them, they were not qualified to receive that encouragement.\nThus, we don’t consider their sorrow as an example. Chapter 1 depicts this. However, Arjuna’s sorrow is worth learning from. To know why, we must observe Pandavas’ disciplined conduct. Let’s try to understand.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus,\nDiscipline always makes one victorious. Lack of discipline causes even great personalities to fail. The first chapter of Bhagavad Gita clearly exemplifies this aspect. Kauravas’ army was 11 akshauhinis, army consisting of 218,700 warriors in size, while Pandavas had only 7 akshauhinis. However, Pandavas’ army operated as an organized, single unit. They all looked upon Sri Krishna as their leader and unquestionably followed his lead. Arjuna was relatively outgoing, yet humble. Hence, he was given priority after Sri Krishna. Then, Bhima was next because of his ferocious and impulsive nature. Though Dharmaraja was the elder statesman, his inherent quality of encouraging the young to be in front positioned him after Bhima. The rest of the army followed. None of them craved fame, nor were they rash. Hence, all Pandavas could conduct themselves as a single, collective team. However, Kauravas lacked this quality. Each and every one wanted to be at the forefront. They were a flock of indisciplined warriors. We clearly observe this in Sanjaya’s words.\nIn chapter 1 verse 13 of Bhagavad Gita, we see that Kauravas sounded their conches at once, soon after Bhishmacharya sounded his conch.\nsa sabdaha thumulo: bhavath\nmaking the whole atmosphere chaotic\nThe war-initiating sounds from the Kaurava army subsided. The opponents’ (Pandavas) also need to respond, right? Sanjaya describes the captivating response of Pandavas.\nIn spite of Dhrishtadyumna as commander-in-chief and Dharmaraja is the eldest amongst Pandavas, it was Sri Krishna and Arjuna who led in the forefront. Sanjaya starts with describing their chariot. Chapter 1 shloka, verse 14 is wonderful. It is the quintessence of the entire Bhagavad Gita.\n\nSLOKA WORD - thathas sve:thaihi hayair yukthe: mahathi syandane: stthithau | ma:dhavaha Pa:ndava:s chaiva divyau sankhau pradadmathuhu ||\nSLOKA MEANING - Then, Madhava (Sri Krishna) and the Pandava (Arjuna), seated in a magnificent chariot drawn by white horses, blew their divine conches.\na nice chariot\na great chariot\nwith pristine white horses\na well-equipped chariot\nMadhava and Arjuna were stationed in this chariot.\ntheir conches were divine\nthey both sounded their conches as a response to Kauravas\nThis is the shloka’s superficial meaning, but it summarizes the essence of the entire Bhagavad Gita. How?\nLet’s understand that later.\nFirst, we can focus on how disciplined Pandavas were.\nResponding to Bhishmacharya’s and Kauravas’ conches, these two sounded their conches. Who? First, Sri Krishna and then Arjuna, in sequence. Sri Krishna is addressed with a wonderful name in this shloka. What is it? The name indicates Sri Krishna initiating the sounding of conches…\npa:nchajanyam hrusi:ke:saha\nIf we want to observe the way these conches sounded, we should understand that each conch had its own signature sound and was named accordingly. Let's examine how.\npa:nchajanyam hrusi:ke:saha\nfirst, Hrishikesha (Sri Krishna) sounded His conch, Panchajanya.\nNo one spoke until this was complete. As the din of the conch gradually subsided…\nde:vadattham dhananjayaha\nDhananjaya (Arjuna) started with his conch, Devadatta.\nAs soon as the sound was heard, it was identified. “Oh wow, this sound is from Devadatta!”\nDevatas, divine souls in God’s administrative force, gifted this conch to Arjuna.\nWhen did they present him this conch?\nWhen Agni Devata, the celestial being controlling fire, devoured Khandava forest, the capable Arjuna protected him.\nArjuna fought against all devatas. None of whom, including the King of devatas, Indra, could defeat him.\nThrilled with Arjuna’s valor, Agni Devata praised and gifted Arjuna with the conch, Devadatta.\nKauravas thought, “Wow, this is not the conch of any common man! It is indeed no ordinary conch!”\nAs the conch was blown, Kauravas were reminded of its owner’s gallantry.\nNo one spoke until Devadatta’s resonance diminished.\nEarlier, we discussed that Bhima was the ferocious one amongst the brothers. As soon as Arjuna stopped, the mighty Bhima started blaring his conch.\npaudram dadmau maha:sankham bhi:ma karma: vruko: daraha\nThe thunderous sound from this conch reminds one of his qualities, toughness and relentlessness.\nAny ordinary conch would have been ground to powder in the hands of Bhima. Hence, handling anything delicate or exquisite by him was out of the question. This conch, Paundra, matches the owner, Bhima, in its ability. Observe its intonation -\nPOUN-DRAM!\nDevadatta is Arjuna’s conch, Panchajanya is Sri Krishna’s; but Bhima’s is PAUNDRAM. The word itself exemplifies the Bhima’s ability.\nWhat is his greatness?\nbhi:makarma: vruko:daraha\none who has a huge appetite like vrukam, fire\nFor instance, when the brothers were in exile, begging for alms while living in Ekachakrapuram, a village half was set aside for Bhima and the other half was split amongst the rest.\nNot giving him even half felt like injustice to Bhima’s ferocious appetite. The name, Paundra, illustrated his capabilities.\nAs soon as the sound from Bhima’s conch waned, Dharmaraja started blowing his conch. Listening to its victorious sound, everyone identified that it originated from Ananta Vijayam conch. One who owns this conch will always be victorious. There is no scope for defeat.\nanantha vijayo:ra:ja kunthi:puthro: yuddhishttiraha\nthis is Yudhishthira\nWhenever he stood in the battlefield, he never took a step back until victory was his. Hence, initially named Dharmaraja, he was titled with the name Yudhishthira.\nWhile his conch sounded, no one came forward. As soon as he stopped...\nnakula sahade:vascha\nboth Nakula and Sahadeva, who were elegant and beautiful, began sounding their conches\nThe sound from Nakula’s conch, sugho:sham, was highly sonorous. Sahadeva, an admirer of beauty, had a conch named manipushpaka. His conch had a cluster of precious gems dangling from it. Whenever he sounded it, the dancing glittering radiance of those gems reflected on his cheeks like a light show. Everyone who listened to its sound was reminded of that beautiful spectacle.\n\nSLOKA WORD - ka:syas cha parame:shwa:saha sikhandi: cha maha:ratthaha drushtadyumno: vira:tas cha sa:thyakis cha: para:jithaha drupado: draupade:ya:scha sarvathah prutthivi:pathe: | saubhadras cha maha:ba:huhu sankha:n dadhmuhu prutthak prutthak ||\nSLOKA MEANING - The great archer king of Kashi, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the unconquerable Satyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu) all blew their respective conches, oh King!\nThe words “prutthak prutthak” are crucial. All the warriors from Pandavas army sounded their conches but no two sounded simultaneously. This demonstrated their discipline. After one stopped, the next started. After he stopped, the third warrior started. The fourth started only after the third, and so on. Thus, they all exhibited their discipline. Doing so, what message did they convey to the opposing army?\n“Beware! We are all following a well-planned, systematic approach. Watch out!”\n“Thus, Oh King! Saghosha, the Pandavas conches resonated for a long time.\nIf they all had sounded their conches simultaneously, the entire process would have been completed within 3 to 4 minutes. Then a sudden silence would have descended on the whole atmosphere. However, the sound of Pandavas conches kept echoing in sequence, perhaps lasting a few hours. How scared would the other side have been, listening to all these conches’ sounds!\nsagosha\nWhat happened?\ndha:rthara:shtra:na:m hrudaya:ni vyada:rayath |\nit shattered the hearts of all your sons (Kauravas)\nDo you know why?\nnabhas cha prutthivi:m chaiva thumulo:pyanuna:dayan\nsounds from their conches resonated and reverberated around earth and into the skies!\nThis is an act of the wise. Previously, during Dipavali festivities, elders would buy different types of firecrackers and distribute them equally to the kids. A few foolish, impulsive kids would group all of their firecrackers together and light them. All would burn at once. Within 10 minutes, all their firecrackers would be exhausted. Those children would then sit idle with folded hands. However, an astute kid would just watch and enjoy the show. After everyone else finished bursting their crackers, he would then start. That too, one-by-one - a sparkler, then flower pot, a rocket, twinkling stars, etc. It would take almost two days to exhaust his stock! The other kids would cry, claiming they received less. However, actually, the fire crackers were equally distributed. Because one kid was wise, he would simply watch when others were exhausting their quota and then would start lighting his, one after another. This is the attitude of the astute. Pandavas were clever, wise. Hence, they followed a protocol. This dwindled the Kaurava army morale.\n“Hey king, this is the difference between your sons and those children. Even now, it’s not too late!”\nHowever, Dhruthrashtra was not in a position to heed Sanjaya’s advice.\nEarlier, we briefly mentioned the importance of chapter 1 shloka 14. It’s wonderful.\nIt gives the essence of the complete Bhagavad Gita. What is that shloka?\nthathas sve:thair hayair yukthe:\nmahathi syandane: stthithau |\nma:dhavah Pa:ndava:s chaiva\ndivyau sankhau pradadmathuhu ||\nIt is the quintessence of Bhagavad Gita. It encapsulates the entirety of knowledge essential to our understanding.\nHow? Let’s understand gradually.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

Not to scare Arjuna, to make him at ease, encourage Arjuna to raise doubts, without hesitation.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = arjunasya:jou: kurvan gi:thamrutam dadau:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = why in a battlefield, surprising\n\nAre people able to comprehend deep philosophical messages just when they are about to sit down for a meal? Similarly, with everyone ready for battle, eager to fight... ...no one will be able to comprehend spiritual topics about soul and God. So, when should this material be taught? In fact, the reason for Sri Krishna avatara (incarnation) was to give this message. He came to benefit lokathraya (all three worlds). However, valuable topics should not be disclosed unless asked for. If shared without being asked, the speaker will be called crazy. Thus, someone should ask. By explaining to the seeker, the same message can benefit everyone. Nothing valuable should be revealed without being asked. Imagine a policeman at a crossroad. If someone asks for directions, then his advice holds value. Otherwise, if he gives various directions to different destinations throughout the day while on duty without being asked... ...people will think he has gone insane and question what happened to him. People will call him crazy. Why? Nothing is incorrect with his information. However, because he is sharing without being asked, the value is not recognized. This goes for any information... Even if it's simply ordinary information, revealing it when not asked is considered an insane act. Who will recognize the value of such an important message like Bhagavad Gita, if disclosed, without being asked? That's why someone must ask. However, people were not in a position to do so. He found only one person. janmaniki oka sivarathri la (once in a blue moon), He waited for a long time, approximately 90 years. He found one, and only person to simply express, “Sri Krishna, all I need is you and you alone.”\nEveryone else was always requesting one thing or another. He did not find even one who could say, “I need you, I have no other means.” Everyone was simply in his own world. When He chose to go as a peace ambassador, Kauravas did not compromise. Ultimately, both parties assembled armies. Let’s recall the events... Both Duryodhana and Arjuna simultaneously went to Sri Krishna for help. Duryodhana reached slightly earlier, and because of his ego, sat near Sri Krishnaʼs head. Arjuna came later and sat near Sri Krishnaʼs feet. With folded hands and head bowed, he paid his respects. Although Sri Krishna was lying down as if sleeping, he would have known what was happening. Pretending to wake up, he first noticed Arjuna and greeted him. Immediately afterward, the proud king, Duryodhana, said, “I arrived first.” Realizing both came to seek help in the upcoming war, He made a proposal to treat both fairly. “I have ten thousand supreme, well-armed, warriors. They will be given to one party and I will join the other party.” “With one condition - I will not hold a weapon. I will not fight in the war. I will simply advise when needed.” “You can choose one - me or the ten thousand great warriors. Arjuna, as the junior, can choose first.” Duryodhana was anxious! Why? He was nervous Arjuna might choose the 10,000 supreme warriors! A lone Sri Krishna, would not fight and would only offer advice. “I already have more than enough war-time counselors,” thought Duryodhana. “Why would I need another advisor for the same?” However, Arjuna was given the first choice. What to do? “Arjuna, pick one option. Choose whom you want,” said Sri Krishna. Arjuna said, “Sri Krishna, I want you.” Sri Krishna said, “I won’t fight in the war.” Arjuna said, “Itʼs not needed.” Sri Krishna said, “I wonʼt even hold a weapon.” Arjuna said, “Itʼs not needed, your presence is enough. Simply be with me.” Duryodhana was jumping with joy. He won the ten thousand-warrior army! With delight, He went to his grandfather, Bhishma Pithamaha. Bhishma was happy as well. Finally, at least once in his life, he saw Duryodhanaʼs face beaming with happiness. Bhishma checked, “did Sri Krishna really say He will not touch any weapon?” “Yes, He said so,” said Duryodhana. Bhishma then made an oath of his own, “Sri Krishna made an oath not to touch any weapons, right? I will make him use a weapon in the war!” Duryodhana was overwhelmed with happiness to hear this. He thought his grandfather always favored Pandavas, in all matters. However, now, Bhishma took an oath to outweigh the very oath Sri Krishna took.! With his grandfather directly opposing Sri Krishnaʼs oath, Duryodhanaʼs happiness knew no bounds.\nOnly Arjuna had the thought, “Sri Krishna, whether you fight or not, being with me is enough.” When the war was to begin, now that Sri Krishna felt Arjuna was favorable... ...intending to use Arjuna as a medium for the divine message, with everyone assembled in the battlefield...\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = sarathyam:ajau kurvan\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = acting as Arjunaʼs charioteer in the battlefield\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = pravruthe: sasthra sampa:the:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = when everyone was literally ready to release their arrow\n\nHe thought that at least now Arjuna would seek good advice. However, since Arjuna still did not ask... ...Sri Krishna transformed Arjunaʼs heroism and enhanced his feelings of grief and misery. He influenced Arjuna to ask an appropriate question.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = na:aprushtaha: kasyachith bhru:ya:th\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = following the scriptural rule that nothing should be disclosed without being asked for\n\nAs if preaching solely to Arjuna...\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = lo:kathrayo:pakara:ya:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = benefitting all three worlds\n\n...with great compassion, Sri Krishna delivered this Srimad Bhagavad Gita. It was vital not only then, but also has equal value today. In addition, to withstand current dangerous situation and to make us mentally strong... ...everyone benefits by understanding Bhagavad Gita, the divine elixir given by Sri Krishna. Thus, letʼs start Bhagavad Gita. Letʼs begin to grasp this message one sloka (verse) at a time. With this in mind, letʼs also learn verses to chant and meditate upon before beginning Bhagavad Gita. This is also our duty. While recollecting this, we just discussed a sloka (verse). As discussed, acting as a charioteer in the battlefield, encouraging Arjuna to fight, Sri Krishna delivered this Bhagavad Gita benefiting all three worlds (higher, lower and earthly plane). Remembering this great deed, we will recite a few prayers given to us by our noble Seers. We can indulge in this githagangodaka snanam (divine bath in the Ganga River that is Gita). Actually, Bhagavad Gita is a collection of 700 slokas (verses). In that, approximately, 574 and a half slokas (verses) were uttered by Sri Krishna - the rest, by others. Once we know the backdrop, we can truly enjoy its beauty. For that, letʼs all prepare. Letʼs pray that the essence of Sri Krishnaʼs blessing becomes instilled in our hearts.\n\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhulara,\nBhagavad Gita is the essence of Vedas, the quintessence of all Upanishads.\nOne of the shlokas, verses from the invocation prayers eulogizing Bhagavad Gita says...\nsarvopanishado: gavo do:gdha: go:pa:la nandanaha\npa:rdho: vathsaha ssudhi:hi bho:ktha: dugdham gi:tha:mrutham mahath\nThis shloka beautifully explains who bestowed Bhagavad Gita, for whose sake, and how it was given.\nPreviously, we discussed how Vedas are the base, a rich mine, an ocean of knowledge for all scientific knowledge that man has attained in any field.\nUpanishads are parts of Veda that contain the knowledge of self, that a desirous true seeker must learn by approaching the Elders.\nThese beautiful Upanishads are also referred to as Vedantam. Generally Vedanta is understood as the ending of Veda because vedantam = veda + antam and anta translates to ‘the ending’. Hence, many conclude that Vedantam is the ending portion of Vedas. However, that is not the correct definition because Upanishads are found in the ending, middle and other sections of the Veda. Not all of them are towards the end, and hence this meaning of ‘Vedantam’ does not fit. Thus, we can’t define it this way.\nAntam means goal. When we start a journey, when does it end? When we start an effort, when does it end? Whenever we attain what we aimed for, that’s when our effort ends. Whenever we reach the desired destination, that’s when our journey ends. So, ‘prayanantam’ is the destination we desire to reach. Prayatanantam is the fruit we desire to attain with our effort. Similarly, ‘veda antam’ is that ultimate knowledge, when learned, puts an end to a seeker’s effort to know everything there is to know. It is that ultimate knowledge encompassing everything and therefore, there is nothing else left to know for the seeker. Vedantam is such complete knowledge, the one which is the destination and goal for all knowledge.\nOnly then, our efforts end. Hence, Vedantam doesn’t mean the ending of Veda. It is the quintessence of Vedas.\nPoets during kavya samayam, poetic conglomerations, delineate the word antam as beautiful and enchanting. They describe, ‘at vanantam’ as ‘at that part of the vana, forest, which holds all beauty’.\nSimilarly, Vedantam is that desirable knowledge which is precious and beautiful. What does one find to be most beautiful? We find our own form to be the most beautiful to us. Everyone feels the same. For others it may not appear so. Our appearance might be horrific or disgusting to others. However, we feel we are very beautiful.\nAs our perception stops at the physical body level, we see one as fair, dark, tall, short, fat or thin. However, the externally visible body is functional because of the invisible ‘I’ tattva (principle), running it.\nWhen present in the body, the body functions. Or else, we call it a dead body. We know this very well. Hence, “I”, which we point to as the indweller, is the life force for the physical body. We call it as jiva or God. It is not akin to elements of nature we see around. It transforms the elements of nature as its body and resides within. Of course, jiva is not capable of that. Someone else gives it a body and the jiva simply resides in it.\nWe need to use this body carefully. Why? This is given to us as a wonderful means to exhaust burdensome loads of karma, the bondage that keeps us tied to life and death. Thus, it is beneficial to attain knowledge that supports judicious use of this wonderful tool. Therefore, it is dangerous to use intelligence that focuses solely on feeding and satisfying this tool. We need to get rid of such intelligence and inculcate an appropriate perspective. Thus, the real meaning of ‘I’ shouldn’t stop at the physical body, but rather reach the in-dweller of this body.\n‘I’ is jiva. Jiva is self-luminous wherever he is. That is called jnana (knowledge). All jivas have jnana.\nThis jnana is natural for all jivas irrespective of which body they are in. However, depending on the bodies, jnana manifests differently. When we light a lantern, the light of that lamp depends on the cleanliness and color of the glass chimney. If the chimney is green, the light also appears green. If blue, the light appears blue, if red, we feel that there is something red inside. Due to the effect of the changes in the outer body and the impact of karma that is responsible for these changes in the body, we are not able to view the indweller i.e ‘I’. However, we are able to see it in everyone separately. That is, we are able to relate to it, at least to an extent. In fact, there is no difference between the jivas at all. Why? Because, no one gave birth to these jivas. Even God did not create jivas. Surprising! You may ask. “How can you say that? Vedas mention many times they were created by Him.”\nthadaikshatha: bahusya:m praja: ye:ye:thi:\neverything emanated out of Himself at His own will\nsrujyatha:\nHe created\nAren’t all these stating that He creates, sustains and dissolves them. Yes! They all exist eternally, but Bhagavan, God is the one who brings everything together and channels them to their respective bodies. Again, once the purpose is over, He brings everything together and then releases them by giving them new bodies accordingly.\nKarma, the resulting state of one’s actions, carried forward from all previous lives, causes changes in bodies. Based on karma, a jiva can be granted the body of an ant, a mosquito, a fly, insect, microbe, flora, fauna, stone, etc.\nIrrespective of the body, the Jiva’s original nature remains unchanged. On understanding this, we realise the oneness of all.\nIf we can understand, see and know the jiva in those bodies in their true nature, we see no differences in any of them. They are all the same. This is the philosophy of samata (equality) with respect to all jivas.\nHowever, jiva is not visible to the naked eye, unperceivable through imagination as well. He can be seen only in shastras (scriptures). Thus, we can know about him, jiva, through shastras alone. It’s not reasonable to declare, “I don’t believe this unless I see it, I want to examine him with an apparatus or tools!” Such arguments are of no avail because we accept so many things not seen as shastras reveal these. The same shastra proclaimed the existence of jiva too! How minute he is.\nJivas inside the body are equanimous, based on the samatha – all have an equanimous relationship with God. All are ‘sat santanam’, worthy children of God, Lord’s progeny. Perceiving this relationship, 1000 years ago, jagadacharya, Guru to the whole world, Sri Ramanujacharya proclaimed, “Everyone is eligible for this mantra.”\nHe called upon everyone and shared the mantra, opening the doors of ultimate liberation to everyone.\nWith no taboos of untouchability, all are equally qualified. Untouchability and other categories are defects limited to the physical body only. In fact, one’s body becomes untouchable if he conducts unnecessary activities. Untouchability sprouts from the behavior of a person. It stems from one’s attitude. An intelligent person can become untouchable if abstaining from righteous deeds. A strong person also becomes untouchable if he fails to use his strength for the benefit of the weak. A person regarding all equally without inhibition becomes worshipable.\nHence, there are no differences between jivas, only the bodies are different for each.\nHow does a particular jiva get a certain body?\nWhy did he get it?\nWho is this jiva?\nWhere did he come from?\nWhy and how did he come into existence?\nWho brought him and when?\nHow is he brought and what does he do?\nThese are the questions one must seek answers for.\nWe know how to decorate our body because it is visible. However, it’s perishable. The imperishable and the invisible entities are atma (soul), and paramatma (the supreme soul sustaining all), God. The sections discussing these become the actual beautiful parts of Veda. That is why wherever these valuable sections exist in Veda are named ‘Upanishad’. These sections could be in the beginning of Veda. Ishavasya, however is towards the end of the last chapter in Sukla Yajurveda. This is the one area where it is towards the end. In others, it is in the middle portion. Hence, Vedantam means Upanishad.\nWhy is it named Vedantam?\nIt is the part of the Vedas elucidating the meaning of the most important and beautiful tattvam...\n... because it explains what we all should know…\n… because it is that which can uplift us.\nOur ancestors declared that Bhagavad Gita is the essence of Vedanta, Upanishad. We can’t read all of them, but we can read and understand Bhagavad Gita. Hence, let us try to understand the encrypted hidden meaning of Vedanta from it during our sessions.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya bhagavadbandhus\nBhagavad Gita is a pre-eminent, divine message giving Vedanta shastram (Vedic essence) to the world, in a simple format, understood even by the untutored. It reveals many rahasyas, commonly known as ‘secrets’.\nWhat is a rahasya?\nWhat does it mean to reveal a secret?\nNormally, we feel a secret is something which cannot be shared with others.\nIronically, secrets spread faster than what actually needs to be known. They reach the entire world faster anything else. The first person says, “I’m sharing this with you alone, be careful!” The second person repeats the same with the third person, and the same continues. Now we have many software apps like WhatsApp, etc., where such secrets are supposedly “kept safe.” It’s surprising to know how many “secrets” get circulated through these mediums.\nWhat does it mean by rahasya?\nNear the beginning of the 14th century, there was a great scholar, Pillai Lokacharya, a guru in our lineage. He gave 18 upanyasas (teachings), called ‘rahasyas’. He named them Ashtadasa Rahasyas.\nDoes rahasya mean that which can’t be known to or shared with others?\nIt is said that a mantra should be carefully kept secret. Does it mean we shouldn’t tell anyone about it? Must be, as it’s termed as ‘secret’! If it is a secret, then why even bring it up?\nRahasya does not mean secret. It means something that is so valuable that it has to be carefully preserved. If not to be shared with anyone, then there is no question of talking about it, at all. Rahasya means very valuable and meant to be shared only with those who recognize its value. This is what we term, ‘rahasya’.\nA country has certain secrets. Military departments have certain secrets. It is said that each profession has secrets. For example, the priest community has their secrets. Only people in that affinity group have knowledge of certain information, not evident to others who are not connected to that group. However, with deep interest and attentiveness, it becomes evident.\nThis is rahasya.\nThere are secrets regarding country, military, or governance. It doesn’t mean this knowledge should be shared with no one. Officers and others in relevant departments know them. They use the information to the extent and the form that is essential. Only to such people are those rahasyas revealed. It’s because they recognize the value. If not, what might happen? Without realizing its value, one could sell information to another country, for example. He would not understand the rationale for preserving it.\nIt should only be given to people wishing to make essential progress without abusing, misusing or neglecting it.\nmanthram yathen:na go:paye:th\nmantra is highly valuable and hence, should be preserved carefully.\nIt doesn’t imply ‘not sharing’ with anyone. It should definitely be given to those who have the ability and deep interest to know and use it properly. This is termed ‘rahasya’. Many such rahasyas exist in our scriptures.\nVedas have many such rahasyas. These rahasyas, valuable knowledge, find place within Upanishads. God assembled all those parts and delivered them to us as Bhagavad Gita. Therefore, Bhagavad Gita grantha (scripture) can aptly be named ‘rahasya grantha’, ‘upanishad grantha’, or ‘vedanta grantha’. That’s why when such knowledge is shared, the recipient’s qualification is gauged to know if he or she can carefully protect it. If capable of protecting it, it is further observed if he is able to deliver it to others clearly, in a way easily understood. Only then, that person is trained to share that knowledge with the world for the benefit of future generations. If given to people without checking such qualifications, they might use that knowledge for fame, money or gaining respect in society. It is best to keep it away from such people.\nThat aside, there is a single letter, omkaram, encompassing the essence of all Vedic knowledge. Vedic literature, Veda mantras, and mantras explaining the meaning of Vedas are all like extremely valuable ornaments. For the one learning properly and attentively, it is akin to a beautiful necklace, as he memorizes them (keeping them in his chest, his heart). Such great people understand and carefully preserve that knowledge in their hearts. As they carefully preserve, they do an extensive search for qualified seekers and give it only to them. Hence, it is called a ‘rahasya’. Many such rahasyas exist in our scriptures.\nThey are hidden via technical terms. Thus, the actual meaning is not obvious. They are not accessible to those who casually check the book. As discussed, they are to be understood only by those who have true desire, and are deeply interested. Wouldn’t the same text be visible to someone casually checking the book? The text will seem simple to him as his vision is limited to the superficial meaning. He would not be able to speak about the inner, great wisdom. To comprehend the actual meaning, one needs to do sushrusha (carefully listening to guru). When the guru is satisfied, then she or he reveals it to the seeker. This is a process termed ‘guru shishya parampara’ (guru-disciple lineage). The lineage secures rahasyas using codified terms.\nWe are familiar with one such common process. If a number needs to be conveyed, it is not mentioned directly. I.e. 487 needs to be conveyed only to interested people who can decode the number. Others may read it as simply as ‘487’.\nHowever, when a rahasya is embedded, one begins investigation. What investigation? The number is 487. The first step is to find the technical term which, when interpreted, reveals ‘4’. Four hundred, eighty and seven. Vedas are 4 in number. Purusharthas (aims of human pursuit) are 4 in number. There are others like this. To hide the number 4, they use technical terms, like purushartha or veda or amnaya. Each has synonyms. I.e., purushartha also means phala, the resulting outcome. Thus, the term phala can also be used to indicate ‘4’.\nOtherwise, ‘veda’ can be used. Veda has synonyms like amnayam or shruthi. Words like these might be used in place. What does the usage of such words indicate? Veda. What does the word, ‘Veda’, indicate? It indicates ‘4’. Therefore, use the number 4 here. When the word ‘Veda’ is used, ordinary folks like us think they are talking about Veda and put it aside. However, a qualified person attentively thinks about why the word ‘Veda’ was used. They reflect and try to decode it. Then they understand that the word ‘Veda’ is used to indicate ‘4’. Conveying the number 8, words connected to ‘8’ will be used, like vasuvus, 8 celestial beings or ashta-vasuvu or ashta-prakrutis or prakruti (nature). When seeing ‘vedam vasuvu’, we might think vasuvu did something to Vedas. However, that’s not the writer’s intent.\nIt means, ‘4’ followed by 8.\n48.\n‘Rushi’ comes next, indicating ‘7’.\nThus, vasuvu from Vedas was transformed into a rushi.\nSeeing this, we might think, “a vasuvu from Vedic times was transformed into a rushi. He might be sitting somewhere in the forest doing penance.”\nHowever, only keenly interested people, understanding these words’ deeper meanings, grasp the author’s message. He understands that the author is indicating ‘487’.\nThere is another rahasya here, ‘ankanam vamatho gathihi’.\nWhen learning to write numbers, we learn how to place digits such as ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.\nEarlier, we said 4-8-7. We must reverse this. The correct number is 784.\nWith this password, a treasure (of knowledge) is opened.\nThat’s how carefully they preserve rahasyam.\nThere are innumerable secrets like these in our Vedic literature. If we can learn to recognize them from a person who knows such secrets, we can learn many things.\nBhagavad Gita is a scripture full of such rahasyas. Let’s try to learn a few such messages.\nWe need not grasp everything, let’s start bit-by-bit.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya bhagavad bandhus,\nWe are trying to comprehend a few aspects of Bhagavad Gita. Literarians globally, novice or expert, all have attempted to connect with Bhagavad Gita.1 None missed the opportunity to opine on it. Anyone recognizing the beauty which Gita holds and the joy it gives, has made it a major part of their lives. Bhagavad Gita is such a great scripture. Sanjaya revealed a beautiful rahasya, hidden message in Chapter 1.\nWe will discuss it now.\nWe learned that Elders use codes to preserve knowledge. Interested people make efforts to decode and understand their essence. Those without deep interest only understand the superficial storyline and relish to that level. Those understanding the depth benefit immensely.\nFor a numeric example, the number 0 would not be used to convey 0. A code word ‘sky’, is used. Similarly, to convey ‘9’, the number 9 would not be used. Instead, a code word ratnam (precious stone) is used. There are 9 types of precious stones. Sampada or nidhi (wealth) can also be used. Wealth is of 9 types. Thus, these code words imply ‘9’ to a sincere seeker. Sometimes, the direct word, such as ratna, is not used. Mani or pravala is used in place. Each is a type of a precious stone, hence, implying ‘9’.\nThere are actually several such great aspects like this. When sharing a mantra, it is not simply given directly. Why? Nowadays, everyone is printing books. Going a step further, in recent times, everything is available via digital archive. Everyone has access. If everyone is able to read the script, understand the essence, and implement it, that’s great. However, do we all have such interest? We may browse through with initial excitement, then we quickly move on. We generally don’t have enough interest to dive deep. It’s not that we’re too busy, we simply don’t have enough interest in the subject. This is why such hidden aspects are not revealed to just anyone. They are revealed only to those seeking with deep interest. Thus, these rahasyas (inner meanings) are hidden in codified words.\nSimilarly, Bhagavad Gita is also embedded in a beautiful codified language. There are countless commentaries on Bhagavad Gita. Even those barely literate are composing commentaries. However, our ancestors revere it as vedanta grantham (scripture revealing the essence of Vedas).2 They firmly believed that it demanded complete focus to comprehend all of its aspects. Thus, they followed a strict process, acharya-upadesam (guidance through a qualified acharya), to properly learn. Through that process, they established Bhagavad Gita’s immense value.\nWhile many types of commentaries on Gita exist, how many recognize Sri Krishna Tattva (eternal reality) in it, and have surrendered to Him? Some preach Bhagavad Gita and talk about attaining union with Bhagavan (God). Some discuss attaining kaivalyam (self-realization). Others, something else. However, is that what this scripture contains? They read the same letters and simply preach out of their own speculation. However, sadly, they do not grasp its intended teaching. Whatever they grasp on the surface, they preach using the name of Bhagavad Gita. Such commentaries also attain global popularity rather than notoriety, perhaps due to the speaker’s personality, his/her oratory skills, etc.\nBecause of its immense depth, the Great Ramanujacharya himself travelled 18 times on foot, 100 miles each way, to learn just one verse. Just one verse. Any common person could read and try to understand it. Probably, we also know that verse!\nsarva dharma:n parithyajya\nabandon all righteous practices\nma:m e:kam saranam vraja\njust surrender to me, alone\naham thva: sarva pa:pe:bhyo:\nI will relieve you from all sins\nmo:kshayishya:mi ma: suchaha\nand I will give you liberation, moksha\nNo need to worry. I will give you liberation happily.\nWow, how greatly He explained it! One need not do anything, no strenuous dharma (righteous deeds), nothing.\nsarva dharma:n parithyajya... \"sab ko chodo!\"\nSomeone once said, “give away all dharmas and surrender to God, Sri Krishna!” Wow, the same one saying to abandon all dharma, then declares\ndharma samstha:pana:ya sambhava:mi yuge: yuge:\nevery yuga, I take birth to establish dharma\nHere, He says He came to establish dharma. There, He says “sarva dharma:n parityajya,” abandon all dharmas!\nIs this crazy talk? Has He come to establish or abandon dharma? He says something there and something else here. However, is there a relation between the two? The same one declares both statements. There must be a connection. What is His mood? What truth is to be grasped?\nTo understand this, Sri Ramanuja, a child prodigy, who impressed his scholarly guru, travelled 18 times by foot, even after accepting the monk order! This must indicate that the word, parityajya, does not simply mean to abandon.\nWhat is Sri Krishna asking us to abandon?\nHow must one abandon it?\nWhere must one abandon it?\nWhen must one abandon it?\nWhy is He asking to abandon it?\nAll these are revealed when you approach Elders and seek guidance. If we learn by our own effort, we understand it as: abandon everything! If He is asking us to do everything, yet abandon everything, what is the connection here? It seems to make no sense, like the words of a crazy person. After learning the meaning, Ramanujacharya was so overjoyed that he shared it with everyone, “even if I land in hell, all others who who I share this with will get liberation!” We have heard this in the life history of Ramanujacharya.\nThere are many such intense, deep verses in Bhagavad Gita. One such verse is chapter 1, verse 14.\n\nSLOKA WORD - thatha swethair hayair yukthe: mahathi syandane: stthithau | ma:dhavah pa:ndavas chaiva divyau sankhau pradadhmathuhu ||\nSLOKA MEANING - Then, Madhava (Sri Krishna) and the Pandava (Arjuna), seated in a magnificent chariot drawn by white horses, blew their divine conches.\nIt appears simple on the surface. We understand the high-level meaning. In Sanskrit, a horse is hayam. A chariot is syandanam.3 White is shwetam. A white horse is shweta hayam.4 We all understand these words, right? Let’s take a deeper look at chapter 1, verse 14. The shloka looks simple, easy on the surface. What does it say?\nthathaha\nlater on\nswethair hayair yukthe:\nthat which has white horses\nmahathi syandane: stthithau\na great, very powerful chariot - mahan syandanam\nstthithau\nthere are (in that chariot)\nThose two. Who?\nma:dhavah pa:ndavas chaiva\nMadhava and Pandava\nMadhava is Sri Krishna Himself and Pandava is Arjuna. They are in the chariot.\nWhat did they do?\ndivyau sankhau pradadhmathuhu\nthey played the wonderful conches in their hands\nHere, Sri Krishna is not referred to as Sri Krishna. Whenever He spoke, the text states ‘Sri Bhagavan uvacha’. Here, the word ‘Bhagavan’ was not used, Madhava is used instead. For Arjuna, neither ‘Arjuna’, nor ‘Partha’ nor ‘Vijaya’ was used. Earlier and later shlokas refer to him this way. Maybe. However, there is an intention in that name. What name?\npa:ndavaschaiva\nand also Pandava\nWhy ‘Pandava’ instead of ‘Arjuna’? Pandava could refer to any of the five brothers, right? Of course. However, there is an intent of referring to Arjuna as Pandava here.\nWords appear simple on the surface. Look how simple the verse is. “Later on, in the chariot drawn by white horses – Sri Krishna, nope, Madhava and Arjuna, nope, Pandava blew their magnificent conches!” This appears as the surface level meaning. However, is that all? No.\nThis verse is actually the essence of the entire Bhagavad Gita! If we understand this verse properly, we know the entire Bhagavad Gita. If we grasp this one verse, the entire Bhagavad Gita is made clear to us. When examining this verse in depth, we can capsulize the entire scripture in it. It is a great verse. What all did he say in it?\nHe said horses, fine. However, why white horses? It seems enough to say that they are in a chariot, but, why mahath ratham (a great chariot)? Why was Sri Krishna referred to as Madhava? Why was Arjuna referred to as Pandava? They played their conches, ok, however, the rest named their conches. They could have as well. Nope, ‘divyau sankhau pradadhmathuhu’.\nDivyau has many meanings, but we can focus on a few. Divya means one that has an unprecedented effect. Both of them are holding a conch. What are they? Is ‘conch’ a code word for something? Is its color a code for something?\nOur gurus wonderfully recognized the essence of this shloka and revealed its rahasya to us. If we also grasp it, not only will we experience bliss, but we will also attain divyatva (unprecedented glory). Let us try to attain it.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya bhagavad bandhus,\nChapter 1, verse 14 of Bhagavad Gita is a wonderful shloka. Just as a small seed contains a large banyan tree, this shloka contains the essence of the entire Bhagavad Gita. As we say, “Bhagavad Gita in a nutshell”...\nIf we understand this shloka (verse) clearly, and expand on it bit-by-bit, it evolves into complete Bhagavad Gita. This implies that we should explore the rest of the scripture in alignment with this shloka. Generally, certain codes are given to indicate the established essence of a particular scripture. When we understand these codes, we must correlate the remaining content accordingly, without contradiction. We cannot simply pick up some random text here and there and declare it to be the essence of the scripture. It is analogous to having a meal in a systematic way, in the right order, and with the correct combination of items such as rice, curry, lentils, papad etc., rather than just individually. Similarly, any scripture contains an essential root element that reveals its comprehensive essence. If we can decode that, everything else comes together effortlessly.\nSome “great” people speak about Bhagavad Gita, singing “Oh Advaitamrutha Varshini.” We don’t know where that was said in Bhagavad Gita. However, great scholars like Ramanujacharya Swami, following the path of His preceptors like Yamunacharya Swami, graced us with its essence, clearly presenting the heart of Sri Krishna. There was an international conference on Srimad Bhagavata, where all scholarly people in the world knowing the ins and outs of Bhagavata attended. It was a 2-day conference. About 1.5 days into the conference, an interesting debate occurred. One person suddenly stood up and said, “Do you know what Srimad Bhagavata teaches? It says, God does not exist. God is not eligible to be worshiped. This is what Bhagavata says.” Everyone was in shock! Why? Because God is in fact the essential truth of Srimad Bhagavata.\nbhagavataha + idam = bhagavatam\nthis is how Bhagavatam was named\nThis is the scripture detailing the marvels and wonders of Bhagavan (God), thus, it is known as Bhagavata. It is a collection of experiences of great people who grasped the complete truth about God. Hence, it is termed Bhagavata.\nAs participants were discussing these aspects, this same gentleman said, “No! Srimad Bhagavata says God is not worshipable!” Eventually, everyone recovered from shock and asked him how he arrived at that conclusion. He immediately referred to the 7th Canto. They quickly turned their pages and read that particular content from 7th Canto. It has the same exact content as he mentioned. The scripture says “Who is God? Where is God? Who is that God other than me? I’m the one who rules this earth.” True, it has the same words. After collecting themselves, they read the pre and post text, and realized that those words were spoken by Hiranyakashipu (a demon who opposed God) when discussing with his son, Prahlada. True, it has the same text. However, can we conclude it to be the essence of Bhagavata? That is the question.\nWe need to understand the contextual pre and post references before summarizing an essence. Scriptures mention six aspects determining the essence of a given text. We need not dive into those details now. If one arrives at its essence without considering the introduction, details, conclusion, and the context of when, to whom, and by whom something was said - one must be termed a ‘media person’.\nThe modern media person, not the media journalists of olden days. Why? Some media personnel pick up only what suits him/her, ignoring the before and after portions of a speech. They repeatedly play the same, a number of times, once in the morning, after an hour, after another five minutes, after 10 minutes, until night...it keeps repeating. We have experienced this well.\nOnce, we went to inaugurate an eye hospital. There were others also. A gentleman was from Washington, DC. During his address at the event, he mentioned that eye diseases are prevalent in children of those who marry a maternal cousin (menarika vivaham). Instead of leaving it at that, he mentioned that Swamijis know more about these issues and should speak about such topics. After he concluded, it was our turn to speak. Since he said we should speak up on this issue, we did. Eminent doctors are stating that menarika vivaha can become the cause for eye diseases and many other diseases as well. Our country has an established family system and as part of it, we have menarika vivaha. That means, menarika vivaha is not prohibited in our country. Sri Krishna married his mother’s brother’s daughter. Her name was Nagnajiti, also referred to as Nila Devi. God Himself did it. There is no mention that His progeny had any kind of eye ailment. Even at an elderly age, His progeny fought valiantly in the war. They had no ailments throughout life. Even in these days, many couples belong to this category; their families live disease-free, happy lives. We all are their descendants and are talking about this now.\nIn most foreign countries, there is no such family system. It exists in certain regions like South America, and may be few other places globally. However, it does not exist in many places. So, there is no scope of such marriages there. People get married to others with different origins, but their families still suffer many diseases. They are the ones who have researched eye diseases. Many doctors claim to have done all the research and discovered these ailments. How are foreigners suffering from these diseases? Not from menarika vivahams! Not only eye disease, but no disease stems from menarikam. There is a technical word used in medical terms. This was informed to us by well-known doctors and we mentioned the same at that time. This was more than 15 years ago. We are stating what doctors have told us. We did not make this up. What is that word?\nIf the doctors cannot figure out the cause of a patient’s pain after conducting all known tests, they have termed it “idiopathic.” That means they do not know the reason, yet, the patient is suffering. So, doctors came up with this term. This is not my interpretation. So, what did doctors declare?\nIdiopathic means the patient is suffering from excruciating pain, yet despite a doctor conducting various CT scans etc., he can not diagnose any root problem. Thus, he tells the patient that he is fine and there is no problem. So, the doctor is saying the patient is fine, but the patient is crying out of pain. What does it tell us? The patient is in a “pathetic” situation. The doctor who had conducted the tests has no clue, so he is an “idiot”. You got the point? The doctor is an “idiot”, and the patient is in a “pathetic” state, so they named this kind of issue as “idio-pathic.” We did not come up with this. We just repeated what doctors had mentioned to us at that time, and even now. We then continued to complete our speech and then traveled back.\nMid-way through our journey, we began receiving phone calls. “Swamiji, what did you say? It has become a big issue.” “They are having big discussions on TV. Several parties have joined the discussion.”\nThey are saying, “Doctor Chinna Jeeyar says, ‘Doctors are idiots’.”\n“Who gave him the right to insult doctors? We will boycott him, and we will protest until he explains and apologizes for what he said.”\nAfter some time, it eventually subsided. So, what did they do? They left out the pre and post portions of the message. They simply picked the portion that they wanted to use. Anyway, picking up a small portion from somewhere and trying to manipulate it is called distortion of facts. It is done to mislead people.\nSimilarly, in Bhagavata, if someone says, “God does not exist and this is the essence of the scripture”, we can conclude the speaker is a fool and trying to fool others. To know the essence, we must understand the whole scripture, in the manner our sages have shown it to us. Then, we can say “This is the essence.” Whichever section you take, it should not contradict the whole and should correlate to the rest. This is the rule. It applies to those who intend to learn scientifically. However, for one who thinks that because he has a tongue, and hence, can say whatever he pleases, ultimately misusing it, what can we say about him? What rules can be applied to him?\nThis is the same message aimed at people who distort facts about Bhagavad Gita. Chant chapter 1, shloka 14. Understand its essence. With it as the key, correlate the remaining content systematically.\nOnly then, will we have genuine reverence for Sri Krishna and follow His path. Otherwise, we are feigning it for selfish purposes.\nLet us try to understand the essence of Gita in the prescribed method!\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya bhagavad bandhus,\nShastra (Vedic literature) recommends incorporating 6 aspects to conclude the purport of any scripture. What are those 6?\nupakramo:pasamha:ro: abhya:sa: pur:vatha: phalam |\nardhava:da upapaththi:cha lingam ta:thparya nirnaye: ||\nThese rules are for those who want to respect the scripture for its true nature. They’re intended for those who want to understand the subject as it’s meant to be, benefit from it, and ultimately comprehend its value. These are not for speculators, who simply say what they think sounds nice and what people want to hear. In fact, these Gita discourses are also not for the audience of those speculators. These lessons are for those who have interest in Gita, trust it, and want to improve their life.\nWhat are these rules called?\nshadvidha tatparya lingas (elaborating a topic while following 6 rules)\nupakramopasamharau: Observing the beginning and end of a scripture to ensure they correlate. A topic that starts in one place should conclude on the same point after its elaboration.\nabhyasa: The repeated reminding of the central topic so the reader does not lose track.\napurvata: The unique aspect revealed by the scripture that distinguishes it from others, its sole purpose for being delivered.\nphala: The resulting benefit of learning the scripture.\nupapatti: The use of intriguing, relevant incidents or logical reasoning to reinforce understanding and faith.\narthavada: Linking a similar event from the past (often through stories or fables) to explain a current situation or moral value.\nFor example, the fable of “The Crow and The Fox” from Panchatantra is a perfect illustration of arthavada. The story's moral is the lesson: one should not be carried away by false praise, as it is often a ploy to gain something from you. The fictional narrative of animals speaking is simply a vehicle to make the moral easy for a child to grasp.\nAuthors of shastras establish the intended purpose of a scripture through these 6 aspects. Our purvacharyas (lineage of gurus) conveyed scriptures with exact meanings, never adding their own interpretations. Ramanujacharya, in particular, was known for this. When writing his commentary on Brahma Sutras, he stated that he was simply elucidating the meaning of the words and the depth of their connection, with no room for his own independent thought process. This is the hallmark of his work and the reason his commentary on Bhagavad Gita is so highly regarded. To truly understand Sri Krishna’s intention, one must follow authentic commentaries that adhere to these literary rules.\nAs an example, we must carefully observe the hidden message Sanjaya gave us in verse 14, Chapter 1.\n\nSLOKA WORD - thathas svethair hayair yukthe: mahathi syandane: stthithau | ma:dhavah pa:ndavas chaiva divyau sankhau pradadhmathuhu ||\nSLOKA MEANING - Then, Madhava and the Pandava, seated in a magnificent chariot drawn by white horses, blew their divine conches.\nLet's dive into the words' in-depth meanings.\nthathaha: \"later on,\" after the clamor of the Kaurava army subsided.\nshvethaihi hayaihi yukthe:: The chariot is \"buckled with white horses.\" The word haya comes from the Sanskrit root haya gathau, which means \"that which moves\" and also implies giving intelligence or knowledge. The four white horses represent the four Vedas.\nmahathi syandane:: The chariot is an \"outstanding chariot.\" The word syandana comes from the root syandu prasravane, which means \"flowing\" or \"moving forward.\" A rule in Sanskrit, gadyarthaha buddhyarthaha, states that words conveying movement also convey conscious intelligence. The chariot, therefore, is symbolic of pranava or Omkara, the ultimate guide of our knowledge.\nstthithau: \"are\"\nma:dhavah pa:ndava: The two people on the chariot are Madhava (Sri Krishna) and Pandava (Arjuna).\nWhat did they do?\ndivyau sankhau pradadhmathuhu: \"they blew their conches, the most powerful ones.\"\nThis is more than a simple description of a scene. The chariot symbolizes Omkara. The horses symbolize the Vedas that navigate this Omkara. The two people on the chariot, Madhava and Pandava, represent something profound. They each hold a conch, creating a sound.\nWhat do the two sounds in Om convey? What does the chariot symbolize? What do the horses symbolize? We will discuss this further.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya bhagavad bandhus, dear devotees…\nBhagavad Gi:tha conveys deep meanings with succinct words. That too, it is bestowed upon us by Sri Krushna, God Himself.\nSri Krushna considered the Upanishads as a cow and Himself as a Go:pa:la, cowherd boy milking the essence from that cow as Bhagavad Gi:tha. He qualified those interested individuals to tastet. A calf is needed for a cow to give milk. The milk is not for the calf alone. The calf is a means to extract the necessary milk. Similarly, making Arjuna as a calf, posing inquiries through him, Sri Krushna gave this Bhagavad Gi:tha elixir to all. Scholars have a nice verse for this.\n\nSLOKA WORD -\nsarvo:panishado: ga:vaha do:gdha: gopa:lanandana:ha\nparthovathsa:ha sudhi:rbho:ktha dugdham gi:thamrutham mahath\n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll Upanishads are like wonderful cows. The one who milks them is the cowherd boy, the son of Nanda, Sri Krishna. Arjuna is the calf. The Bhagavad Gita, a great nectar, is the milk, and spiritually-minded people are the drinkers.\n\nSri Krushna is such an expert. He preached not because He is all knowledgeable and wanted to speak whatever He wanted. Cowherds don’t produce anything different than what the cows give. Similarly, Sri Krushna milked these Upanishad 'cows' and gave everyone their essence. do:gdha is His name, His Title. gopa:lanandana:ha means the cow needs a calf, which triggers the cow, to start the milking process. partho:vathsaha, Arjuna was used as that calf. Who drinks the milk then? sudhi:hi bho:ktha, spiritually interested people are qualified to consume this milk. What is that milk? dugdham gi:tha:mrutham mahath, the wonderful Bhagavad Gi:tha. What is its greatness? It does not diminish if you drink it once. The more you drink, the more its taste enhances. vardhate: vardhate: vardhate:, an ocean of knowledge, it does not deplete – the more it quenches the thirst of seekers, the more its essence and greatness grows. This is the vaibhava, wealth, of Bhagavad Gi:tha.\nChapter 1, verse 14 reveals the essence of the entire Bhagavad Gi:tha. Let’s dive in. The verse says, “in a radiant chariot with wonderful white horses, Ma:dhava and Pa:ndava blew their divine conches.” We are trying to learn the hidden meaning behind this verse, as given by Sanjaya. Haya means Horse, Syandana means Chariot. It doesn’t matter whether we call it Sri Krushna’s or Arjuna’s chariot. This chariot has great importance, hence ‘Mahath syandana’. It was not made by any common carpenter. Once, Arjuna performed Kha:ndava Dahana. Agnide:va, celestial being in God’s administrative force controlling fire, unable to digest large quantities of ghee offered during Rajasuya Ya:gam, sought advice from celestial doctors. They suggested to consume, i.e. burn down, Kha:ndava Vanam, full of medicinal herbs, the magnificent forest cultivated by Indra, the king of heaven. Hearing this, Agni De:va was nervous. Wouldn’t he lose his post by burning down his master’s forest? Not sure of what to do and unnable to bear the indigestion, he sought the help of Arjuna, a savyasa:chi, expert archer able to shoot arrows using both hands. Immediately, Arjuna promised protection. It was his habit to protect, without hesitation, anyone seeking refuge. Arjuna does not even consider his own capability. His confidence comes from his faith in Sri Krushna, always there to rely on, in any situation. With this confidence, Arjuna offered protection and asked Agni to consume Kha:ndava Vana with fire, at will. Immediately, Agni began burning Kha:ndava Vana. Indra found out and ordered huge storm clouds to extinguish that fire. Agni again rushed to Arjuna in panic and sought protection. Arjuna again pacified Agni and released many arrows forming a protective layer over the entire Kha:ndava Vanam, preventing even a single water droplet from reaching the fire below. No amount of water or stones could penetrate that covering. Indra tried vehemently to extinguish Agni’s fire but failed despite the assistance of many other de:vatha:s, celestial beings in God’s administrative force. Sri Krushna was the support there for Arjuna to create that covering and fight with de:vatha:s. Thus, Agnideva could happily consume Kha:ndava Vanam. Out of gratitude, Agnide:va offered a few gifts to Krushna and Arjuna. One was the divine chariot, Sugho:sha, which Arjuna used in war. One of the gifts was the divine chariot that Arjuna is using in the war. It is named Sugho:sha, which makes a wonderful sound while it moves. It is also named Nandaka, which gives bliss. Such is the greatness of this chariot. Once, children of a brahmin were disappearing as soon as they were born. All attempts to trace the reason were in vain. That brahmin came to Arjuna, surrendered, and explained the plight of his children’s demise. Arjuna pledged, “Henceforth, I will take the responsibility of protecting your children.” The children were disappearing immediately after birth. Nobody knew who was responsible. The brahmin asked Arjuna, “What will you do if you are unable to find out the reason and protect them?” Arjuna said “If I’m unable to fulfil my promise, I myself will jump into a fire offering.” 9 months later, brahmin’s wife was about to deliver.. Arjuna was ready with his bow and arrows. He constructed a fence around the area. Then he heard a voice, “A child was born, and the child disappeared.” Arjuna was dreadfully ashamed. He thought, “In spite of my alertness and effort, how did this happen?” Everybody remained silent as nobody could dare tell him anything. “It is so shameful not to keep my promise, it’s better not to live at all.” As he was about to enter the fire, Sri Krushna came to the rescue. “Oh Arjuna, brother-in-law, what about my sister’s fate if you do this?” Arjuna replied, “What should I do? I made a pledge and could not keep my promise. I must perish!” Sri Krushna said, “Why did you take such a pledge? You should vow for what you are capable of, rather than such things.” “Anyway, somehow I have to protect my sister’s husband, so, I will take you on this chariot to retrieve those children.” Sri Krushna took Arjuna with Him, that too, during the night. They needed to return with the children that same night, before dawn… …all the while, crossing earth, other planets, the sun, the milky way, other galaxies and ultimately reaching the end of the universe itself. At that point, as Arjuna had no authorization to go further, Sri Krushna proceeded even further. They brought those children back, including the ones who had disappeared previously. All this was done swiftly before dawn. We all know the tremendous journey to the moon. We know it takes 7 days to reach the moon and 7 days to return. For other planets, it takes months. For planets like Saturn, it might take us several years, even with modern rockets traveling 25,000 miles per hour! We can imagine how long it would take to reach the end of the universe! Sri Krushna took Arjuna along and did this overnight. Imagine the immense speed they travelled in that chariot, without any burns or air-pressure problems? This episode reveals the greatness of that chariot. Today, we are able to send rockets quite far off. However, they do not return. The chariot Sri Krushna drove during Dwa:para Yu:ga travelled to the end of universe and returned with immense speed, without a scratch, without any inconvenience to its passengers! There was no trouble to Arjuna or even the small children who were brought back in that chariot and handed over to the brahmin mother and father. What a great chariot! What a great charioteer this Sri Krushna is! That very moment, Arjuna decided to have Sri Krushna as his charioteer in case of any future war. That’s why, when choosing between Sri Krushna and His army, Arjuna chose Sri Krushna. “Having You with me is enough.” “Just be my charioteer, that's enough! You need not participate in war, You need not take up any weapons. Just be with me, that’s enough.” Arjuna said this remembering Sri Krushna’s charioteering expertise while saving the brahmin’s children. The chariot travelled extremely far, at incomprehensible speed, without any inconvenience to its passengers. It came to be known as Nandaka - The Great Chariot, Mahath-Syandana. Let’s keep discussing.\nJai Sri:manna:ra:yana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya bhagavad bandhus,\nEven today, people give lovely names to their vehicles, ornaments, and weapons. The chariot in which Sri Krushna and Arjuna reached the battlefield also has a name. Nandaghosha. It makes a nice ghosham (sound) and creates nandam or anandam (bliss). Thus, it is nandaka and sugosha as well. Hence, named Nandagosha. In chapter 1, verse 14, there is a mention of this chariot, Nandagosha.\nmahathi syandane: stthithau\nin the incredibly influential chariot\nThe chariot has enormous strength. What is that strength? We discussed earlier, during khandava dahanam (burning down of Khandava Forest), agnihotra (celestial being controlling fire) gave two gifts to Arjuna out of gratitude. What are they? The first one is the chariot named Nandagosha in which Sri Krushna and Arjuna are seated, getting ready for the battle.\nAs discussed, it is nandana and sugosha. Combining these words, it is named Nandagosha. It was given by Agnihotra.\nThe next gift was a wonderful bow named Gandiva. When Arjuna emerged victorious over Indra, all devatas (celestial beings in God’s administration) were pleased with Arjuna’s skills and gifted him with a sankha (conch). The conch that is to be blown as a mark to begin battle! The name of that sankha,conch is devadatta – given by devatas. Sri Krushna’s sankham also has a name, Panchajanya. After killing an asura (demon) named Panchajanu who lived in water, Sri Krushna’s conch was made from the spine of that asura. It is called Panchajanya as it is related to Panchajanu.\nEven the horses which are tied to the chariot are very powerful. Four horses are tied to this chariot. Some people draw pictures of Sri Krushna and Arjuna in a chariot with five horses. They depict them as panchendriyas (five senses). This is incorrect. There is also a chariot with five horses. That chariot is the jiva’s (soul's) chariot, not what Sri Krushna drives. It is mentioned in a different place in a different context.\nThe horses tied to the chariot, Nandagosha, are used by Sri Krushna and Arjuna in Bharatha Sangramam (battle between Kauravas and Pandavas). These horses belong to Sri Krushna. When Sri Krushna is driving the chariot, He needs those horses which listen to Him and are accustomed to Him. That’s why He used His own horses and tied them to this chariot, Nandagosha.\nThe names of those four horses are\naswascha se:bya sugri:va me:ghapushpa vala:hakaha\nOne is named Sebhya, the second is Sugriva, another is Meghapushpa and the fourth is Valahaka. These four horses, white in colour, are tied to this chariot. What is this chariot? What are those horses? Let’s explore.\nPreviously, we discussed the essence of the word, syandana. The root of this word comes from syandu + prasravane:. something that flows, enables flow, and moves, enabling movement. This root word indicates movement, gamanartha. Gamanartham reveals jnana (knowledge) and becomes buddhyartham (translated into intelligence) as well. Meaning it grants knowledge, has the power to grant knowledge to the world. One that gives such power is omkara. This chariot, syandana, is an amazing chariot called omkara. There are four horses that pull this chariot. What are they? They are the four Vedas named, Rug, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva. These are white. Vedas give jnana (knowledge).\nvid jna:ne vid la:bhe\nVedas give knowledge, revealing the purpose of one’s existence\nTo tell us what they are, Vedas are named as hayam (horses). Hayagathau is the root word. It also indicates something that moves, that which grants knowledge. Vedas show us all types of goals that can be obtained and the means to attain each one of them. What are the different types of results or goals one can aim for and how to attain them. This is similar to what horses do - where we can go and how to go there – they take us. Thus, horses indicate Vedas. What kind of horses are these? They are white in color. Actually, it seems like an unnecessary adjective. They could be white or black or red. Why is color important? There must be some purpose. Here, white perhaps indicates that they were brought from some Arab country, not needing a whip to be driven. These horses understand the intentions of the rider and behave accordingly.\nswe:thaihi hayaihi\nindicating absolute faultless characteristics of Vedas, these horses are referred to as white in color\nSwe:thatthva is a symbol of purity. When discussing Vedas, we need to know that they are flawless and pristine. Why? Usually (people think of) Vedas as scriptures. Many people think someone wrote Vedas 3000 years ago, or even further around 20000 B.C. Thus, they talk of people as ‘those living in Vedic times’, etc. However, Vedas are timeless, they have no beginning. Why? Vedas were not written by anyone. If written by someone, we could say it was written during a particular time, printed at a particular time, by a certain person who wrote it, his time period, etc. However, nowhere in Vedas has it been revealed that a particular person has written them at a particular time and place. When discussing Vedas, it is said, “This is what Elders, the wise, told us.”\nithi sushruma purve:sha:m ena sthad vyecha chakshiree\nwhatever our elders have told us, we are saying the same - we have not written this ourselves\nHence, Vedas have no beginning. All other scriptures have a beginning. Bharatha has a beginning - Vyasa wrote it. Ramayana has a beginning - Valmiki wrote it. Matsya Purana, Kurma Purana, Varaha Purana (histories of God’s avataras as a divine fish, tortoise and boar) and other puranas were all written by someone during a particular period. Veda is not anything like that. It is not composed by purusha (a being). Hence, it is apaurusheya. All others are paurusheya granthas (written by someone). However, Vedas are apaurusheya granthas (not written by anyone). Why do we name them as apaurusheya granthas?\nUsually if humans write something, that work is liable to contain some fault. What kind of faults? There could be misinterpretations, a fault termed bhrama. Whenever written by a human, there will be some level of misinterpretation. Another type of fault is pramada, lacking attention. Just as Vedas do not have misinterpretation, they also lack inattentive delivery, unlike human-composed literature. Veda is content with no chance of being composed with an inattentive mind.\nThe word pramada has different meanings in different languages. In Tamil language, it means ‘really nice’. If you give tasty coffee to a Tamilian, he may say ‘romba pramadam’. We also need not think that some danger has arisen because pramada in Telugu means danger. Pramada in Sanskrit means inattentiveness. In any man-made literature, no matter who composes it, there may be pramadam (faults due to inattentiveness). However, Vedas were not written even by God. That’s why they are unambiguous. They tell exactly what needs to be told, very clearly and directly.\nThirdly, if books are written by human beings, they might be saying something to deceive the reader or to satisfy him for selfish motives. This is vipralipsa. Man-made literature could have vipralipsa but Veda doesn’t have that fault, vipralamba. They don’t say anything for someone’s sake. Vedas described truths as they exist, clearly - whether you like it or not. Hence, Veda is free of that fault as well. Veda has no vipralipsa anywhere.\nFourthly, there is a chance that one cannot express his intention with proper words. Any author, , may know something very well but find it challenging to express it literally. For example, we know the taste of sweetness. If someone asks for the taste of mysore pa:k, gula:b ja:mun, laddu, ja:ngari (Indian sweets), we say that they are all sweet. We also say that sugar and jaggery are sweet. However, if someone asks us to describe the word ‘sweetness’, we can’t do it. We know it, but we can’t explain it. No one can explain it. There is a difference between the sweetness of each item compared to the other item, jile:bi versus ja:ngari, jaggery versus sugar, laddu versus mysore pa:k. If someone asks us to describe the difference, we can’t. We can’t describe it in words. We feel helpless in explaining things we know. In anything man made, there is a chance for this inability. Not only man made, anything made by any being has this limitation. Vedas do not have such limitations as they are not composed by anyone. They are free from this limitation, termed ashakthatha (helplessness or inability).\nVeda does not have bhrama, pramadham, vipralipsa or ashakthatha. It is out of the realm of these 4 types of limitations, all-together operating at a different level. Thus, Vedas are referred to as white. By referring to Vedas as white horses, it is conveyed that Vedas give us pure, faultless knowledge. Vedas are the horses drawing the omkara chariot. Let’s try to learn how it fits in our case, and what else this verse is saying.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

It depicts how easily and wonderfully they explain profound topics.\n“Seated on the magnificent chariot, harnessed by the four white horses, Madhava and Pandava played their divine conches.”\nThis is the 14th verse. However, every word in the verse has a very deep meaning. Previously, as we discussed, each word is symbolic. The use of the word, syandana (chariot), implies something. The use of the word, hayam (horse), implies something. The use of the word, swetha (white), implies something. White horses represent four Vedas. They are specific.\nIn general, any written manuscript may contain four types of limitations. They are bhrama (inadvertence), pramada (inattention), vipralipsa (cheating) and asakthatha (inability of the senses). Some books contain all four types of errors. Some are exclusively composed of these errors! Even for books written by our ancestors, there may be some of these errors. That is why it is considered that Vedas are not written by any specific person.\nGreat personalities, like Nayyayakass (logicians), suggested that God authored Vedas. Our Vedic scholars do not agree, “even God did not write Vedas.” God can be known through Vedas, but He did not write them. He is a srashta (one who does srujana). Srujana itself means to bring out what is inside. It means bringing something from an invisible form to a visible form. He gave a recognizable form, Vedas, to that which exist in Him in the form of breath. He taught the same to Bramha and others. He also did not create Vedas from scratch. Those who study Veda or Vedantha proclaimed this as the essence. We need to understand this. That is why Vedas are represented by hayams (horses) that guide us, steering us within the lanes of life. To represent their attributes, they are described as swethaihi (white or pure) hayayihi (horses). A chariot pulled by four white horses - this is represented as four Vedas.\nVedas are apaurusheya. Something which is written by a purusha (one who lives in a body) is called pourusheya. Apaurusheya means not written by any purusha. God also belongs to the category of purusha. We are normal purushas, He is the supreme purusha. Veda is not even written by Him. Hence, Vedas are declared as apaurusheya. Some may question “How can a scripture exist without someone authoring it?” These people may consider this a clever question. However, one must understand what apaurusheya means. There are umpteen examples of such things in this world, where the sounds are not a result of any human intervention. The chirping of birds is one example. Who could have taught them? A crow’s call has not changed in thousands of years. It is the same as it has ever been. Does anyone have to teach a crow to call? A peacock’s squawk also has not changed, from thousands of years. A lion’s roar has not changed in lakhs of years. These are also apaurusheya, in one sense. One may argue, “all of these examples are living beings.” Okay, consider the sound of ocean waves. These sounds existed as they are now from time immemorial. They will sound the same forever. Who created them? Did you? Did I? I didn’t. We don’t know who created them. No living being has created that sound. Hence, there is no rule that only a living being must create something. The sounds, or the written content, or the words that a human being creates, change over time because humans are never stable. Sounds made by other living beings or nature doesn’t change. A man’s thoughts or words are neither pure nor stable. He uses the same words to convey different meanings as time changes. Let’s examine a common expression, ‘high-level’, used by people in the computer industry. When somebody says, “this decision was made at a high-level,” they mean surface level [not in depth]. However, the actual meaning of ‘high-level’ is something ‘very deep’, not easy to grasp for someone with basic knowledge. However, current usage indicates ‘high-level discussions’ as which are not in detail, they are at a basic level. Two contrasting meanings to the same word! There are many other similar examples.\nThe words and the corresponding meanings used by humans are all fickle. Unlike man, other creatures in nature do not change. Sounds of nature also do not change. Hence they can all be categorized as apaurusheya. Have animals ever changed the sounds they make? No. A cat meowed in Sri Rama’s time-period exactly as it does today. How many eras have passed? How many lakhs of years? Does it change? Did human beings maintain that stability? Animals and birds have maintained. Okay, let’s put living beings aside.\nLet’s look at non-living entities, like wind. When wind passes through a flute, a sound is produced. Such instruments are termed kichakamulu (wind-based musical instruments). The sound produced by such instruments is venu nada (the sound of a flute). Has it ever changed? It has not, it sounds the same even today as when Sri Krushna played it. The sound of the ocean waves has not changed since time immemorial. Do we call it living or nonliving? What about paurusheya or apaurusheya?\nCertain sounds contain the secrets of nature and possess the power to transmit them. Those sounds have emerged by themselves, just as the sound of ocean waves or the wind exist by themselves. Such sounds are called apaurusheya.\nSages comprehended these sounds during a deep meditative state as their consciousness was completely pure to receive them. A dish antenna receives signals present in air and then transforms them to a format which one can see [television]. Similarly, sages used their intellect to receive knowledge contained in natural sounds and passed on the same to future generations. Thus, this knowledge shared was extraordinary. The meaning of those sounds cannot be understood through any other means such as the physical senses, or imagination. Therefore, such knowledge was termed vedayathi (that which enlightens!) Hence, it was termed ‘Veda’. The one who comprehended it passed it onto his students. They, in turn, did the same and this continued for ages. Nobody knows when it originated, by whom and for how long.\nIt is an uninterrupted stream of knowledge passed on in lineage, from one to another exactly as the first one has begun it and concluded it. This is called ‘apurusheyatva’ (the succession of knowledge from one to another with no distortion from the origin).\nThis is a fantastic concept that we need not delve deep into for now. As Vedas are apaurusheya, which are impeccable, they are represented by white horses. Therefore, they say the chariot has four horses representing four Vedas. They are pulling something. What is it? They are pulling omkara, the sound of ‘om’, the essence of Vedas. Om is like a precious manjushika (a jewelry box), containing Veda. Generally, people store a valuable ornament in a jewelry box. When wanting to use it, they open the box and remove it. When finished, they place the ornament back in the box and close it safely. Similarly, Vedic scholars use a box, ‘om’, to begin reciting Vedas. They decorate their neck [vocal chords], with these mantras like a necklace, memorizing them. When finished, they again end with ‘om’.\nThey recite ‘Harihi Om’ when beginning to recite Vedam. At the end, no matter how long the recitation, they end with ‘Harihi Om’. As the recitation starts and ends with ‘om’, it is represented as a jewelry box. After chanting ‘om’, they recite Veda to the people of this world. Veda, therefore, is considered as a neck ornament [vocal chords] as it is memorized. Veda is neither to be recited by looking at the text, nor it needs any enrichment by being understood by others.\nMany people try to understand it. They think that what cannot be understood is mere waste. However, those who term it a waste are mere wastrels. One need not “understand” Vedic sounds. Can one fathom the sounds of ocean waves? Or the sound of wind? Can one fathom the koel’s cooing, a peacock’s scream, or a lion’s roar?\nYou simply hear it to adore it, and benefit from it. Veda is like this. Some people can explain the inner meanings. Let that be put aside for now. However, Vedic sound in itself is powerful and effective. That’s why it is memorised. They begin with om and end with om. This is why om is represented by a jewelry box which safeguards Vedam. The greatness of om is thus specified. It is driven forward by four Vedas. For this reason, Vedas are represented by horses. Om is represented by the chariot that is driven by Vedas. The chariot (om) gives us jnana (knowledge) and is thus termed, syandana. It makes one happy when one understands it. Therefore, it is called Nandagosha (a beautiful sound, giving bliss). It is also called ‘pranava’. Pranava is the chariot. The horses are Vedas. Their (om and Vedas) journey is with two - Madhava [Sri Krishna] and Pandava [son of King Pandu, Arjuna].\nLet’s further unravel the hidden meanings of this journey.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nIt seems, astronomers discovered a fascinating nadam (divine sound) connecting all the planets and galaxies in this infinite, universal space. A modern Nobel laureate mentioned a theory in science termed ‘strings theory’. In summary, it implies that all planets in the entire universe are held together by unknown strings, keeping them in designated positions. We can put such theories aside for now. However, a NASA video supposedly reveals that the divine sound is ‘Om’ and spread across all celestial bodies. They installed highly powerful microphones in space to magnify the sound.\nMany of us might have seen that video. The video essence is that the divine sound, ‘Om’, is holding the entire universe in it and with it. In fact Vedas, convey the same. This same message is the essence of Vedas. We discussed how Vedas are like jewels adorning great people. Vedic scholars memorize Veda and always associate themselves with it through recitation. Hence Vedas are regarded as their necklace [adorning the vocal chords]. They begin and end recitation with ‘Om’. Hence, Om is considered as a box storing and protecting valuable ornaments, Vedas. This is what our sages revealed.\n\nSLOKA WORD -\nO:mka:ra prabhava: ve:da:h: O:mka:ra prabhava: swara:ha: |\nO:mka:ra prabhavam sarvam jagath stha:vara jangamam ||\n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nall moving and non-moving objects, all substances, all sounds they produce, and anything else other than these, emerge from the divine sound of ‘Om’\n\nWe can imagine the greatness of this sound, Om. Everything, including Vedas, musical tones, and the multitude of all moving and non-moving substances, emerge from the root, Om. It encompasses everything.\nEarlier, we discussed the same as Narayana, where Narayana Tattva (supreme eternal entity) encompasses all beings from within and around. Vedic literature states the same. It is said that the divine sound, Om, or the ‘Om strings’ connect everything from everywhere by being within and around it all. That implies that the same exists within us too. It also exists surrounding us. Hence, they intended to describe in this ‘strings theory’ the existence of the divine sound, Om. However, they do not say it directly because they don’t believe in Vedas or Om. They cannot accept it because of ego, pride and scholarly degrees. Let’s put that aside for now. However, everything they said is already contained within ‘Omkaram’. The same is already defined as God. Hence, Om is God Himself. Taking this a step further, in Bhagavad Gita ‘Vibuthi Visthhara Yoga’ (God explains His glory), God explains His glory, defining Himself to be Om. We need to know that Om is the root cause for all of existence.\nOm is also termed pranava, meaning one that controls something completely. It means that Om has the ability to contain the all-powerful supreme God, named Narayana, in it. Therefore it is termed, pranavam.\npranava:dhya: sthatha: ve:da:ha:\nVedas begin chanting Om, with the name of God’\npranave: paryavasthi tha:ha:\neverything returns into pranava\nva:ngmayam pranavam sarvam,\nthe entire Vedic literature exists to elaborate pranava\nAlternatively…\nva:ngmayam pranavassarvam,\nall Vedic works are the expanded form of pranava\nVangmaya is that which appears in the form of various sounds. Commonly, ‘vangmaya’ can be translated as ‘literature’. However, it actually refers to various sound formations. All various sounds, voices, words, languages, and everything else we know in existence are pranava, they all originate from ‘Omkara’.\ntasma:th pranava mabyase:th\nhence, our sages recommend practicing Omkara\nWhat does this convey to us? It conveys how powerful and effective Om is. Om is the form of God. To explain this fact, a great chariot is brought into place. What kind of chariot is this? It is syandana (that which spreads its essence to the world). We discussed the root, syandu prasravane. A stream or a channel spreads water to the entire land for cultivation and survival. Similarly, Om is the mountain that spreads streams of knowledge to the whole universe, thereby elevating us. This is syandana. However, Sanjaya added an adjective to this - “mahath syandane:sthithou.” Mahath syandanam. Mahath means great. So, what is the greatness of Om? It not only elevates people who worship in this world in this time period. It is so powerful that it liberates all people in any time period, in higher worlds, etc. Hence, it is termed mahath syandanam. That is the power of pranava, Om. It’s not ordinary.\nWhat’s the use? Some people who meditate upon it do not understand its purpose and what is to be done. They distort the intonation, adding new tones. Om has its defined tune. However, they ruin it in every way possible, pronouncing different intonations. Sastra (Vedic scripture) specifies rules on how to pronounce ‘Om’. Sound lengths are measured by matra (unit of time), i.e. one matra, two matras, or three matras. Grammarians specified rules to measure matra. A matra is relative to the person using it. If someone is slow, they take longer to say even the first matra.\nLet’s examine the indigenous rooster, not ones from hatcheries we see today. Indigenous roosters have red crowns and a red beard, and make a clucking sound, “kokkorokoo.” Hybrid roosters from recent days do not make such sounds, they make different sounds. Grammarians have taken the sound of these native roosters to explain a matra. Eka matra defines the length of the first sound the rooster makes, “ko.” It continues to say “kokkoro:.” This is dvi matra dhvani, defining the length of the second matra. It ends saying, “kooo”, “kokkorokoo.” This is tri matra dhvani, the length of the third matra.\nWe discussed previously that the sounds of nature, animals, and birds never change. We may ask, why do the roosters from hatcheries make different sounds than the others? By nature, they do not change. However, human intervention affects their natural properties. The roosters from hatcheries are genetically modified by humans and thus, are not natural roosters. Hence, such transformed breeds are not of interest in regards to this topic. Anything natural does not change. The sounds they make do not change. Similarly, the natural breed of roosters has the original sound that does not change.\nPeople from English countries later refered to this this as “cock-a-doodle-doo.”In reality roosters do not make such a sound. Thus, it is said that roosters from English countries do not cluck, but ours do. The sound from natural roosters measure eka matra, dvi matra, and tri matra. Pranava, the sound of ‘Om”, also should be used within these matras. Veda clearly states that results vary based on how it’s used, not based on one’s preference. Some people worship or chant Om saying, “ooooooo...mm.” Why should one elongate the ‘O’ to that level and then make mmm sound very short? That is not how it is meant to be said.\nEither meditate with eka matra, dvi matra, or tri matra. In case you want to practice it, you can practice on the nada and not on the matra. Nada is the ending part, mmmmm.. If we meditate on Om with eka matra (1 ‘o’ count), we will be blessed with worldly benefits. If we meditate on it with dvi matra (2 ‘o’ counts) as ooo...m, we will be blessed with atma sakshatkara (self-realisation). If we meditate on it with tri matra (3 ‘o’ counts), we will attain the purpose of life. One will not only lead the current life with all he needs, but also will have secured the essentials for afterlife. Meditating on ‘Om’ with tri matra gives the most benefits, oooooo..m. After this, if you want to practice it, you can stretch the ending, mmmmmmmmm... as much as you prefer. However, one should not stretch between ‘o’ and ‘m’. We are not sure why recently everyone is practicing in the wrong way. Maybe because of this, we are affected with scary results such as the Covid-19 pandemic. That is not the correct way to chant. Eka matra, dvi matra, and tri matra should be used based on what you desire. Tri matra is the most beneficial as it has the potential to yield both worldly and divinely benefits. This is Om. If one can practice and reach the stage of chanting it in the right way, then Vedas emerging from it will reveal its meaning.\nWhat does Om say? This nada is not only worshipped and meditated on by people from this world, but also by devatas (celestial beings) in heaven, by liberated souls and by souls who have always been free and in bliss with God. It is for everyone. In order to remind us of the importance of Om, Sanjaya brilliantly added an adjective, “mahath” to describe this chariot. It is therefore mahath syandanam. We will learn more about this.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya bhagavad bandhus,\nSages and acharyas (spiritual teachers) have been highly merciful to give us the greatest scriptures for our upliftment. The volume of Vedic literature is immeasurable. We lack the ability to appreciate even the names of all the scriptures they provided to us. A great seer once said, “With chalk, one can write the names of scriptures along the circumference of Earth, and still wouldn’t be able to finish.” Only the names of those texts! Such is the volume of literature given by sages and acharyas. This could be because each brain has a special intellectual level like each tongue has a special taste. Keeping in mind the interests of each individual, scriptures were provided to attract the individual’s attention, ultimately leading him or her to core truths for their benefit.\nThe humongous efforts by our great sages and acharyas gave us fantastic literature. The source of all this literature is Veda. Veda exists as four forms - Rug, Yajur, Sama, Attharva. Scriptures reveal that the 4 Vedas are divided into 1131 branches. If one focuses only on it, it takes a minimum of 24 years to study one branch. Despite that effort, it is still difficult. One can imagine the extensive knowledge embedded in the 1131 branches. All that vast knowledge base is distributed into 4 main parts: Rug, Yajur, Sama and Attharva. Rugveda has 29 branches. Yajurveda has 101 branches, Samaveda has 1000 branches and Attharvaveda has 9 branches. This extensive knowledge base, Veda, is the source for all literature we have been given. Veda emerged from ‘omkara’. Sri Krushna graced us with Bhagavad Gita to elaborate the meaning of the divine sound, om. This was explained by Sanjaya in chapter 1, verse 14. He referred to om as ‘syandana’ (a chariot) - a ‘mahath syandana’ (a great chariot). Om is so powerful that it can liberate anyone from all the three worlds. Therefore, it is referred to as ‘mahath syandana’. This is termed pranava or omkara.\nWhat is the tattva (philosophical theory), established as this chariot? What is the essence of omkara, that which is riding the chariot? Some people say it represents union with Brahma. Others say something else. Some others believe that its worship gives a seeker good health. This would be analogous to using crores worth of precious kohinoor diamond as a paperweight, ignorant of its true value. The value of omkara is boundless. Om has the power to bestow benefits greater than the value of all Vedas combined. How? There are two people in omkara, the chariot.\nma:dhavaha pa:ndavas chaieva\none is Madhava and the other is Pandava\nWhat are they doing?\ndivyau sankhau pradadhmatuh\nthey both are sounding divine conches\nThey are indicating that they are ready, and questioning if we are. Implying that they are ready to give what is to be given, and questioning others for their readiness to receive.\napa:ram anantham amu:lyam\nif ready to receive, boundless precious treasure will be yours\nThis is what they both conveyed with the sound of the conch shell. One is Madhava and the other is Pandava. Each held a sankha (conch). They have an undetachable bond with each other. They are brothers-in-law, an inseparable bond. What are the constituent entities in omkara? You may have heard - it is composed of ‘a, u and m’. The sound of the three together, a, u and m makes om. Some so-called intelligent people say that when a, u and m are together, it should sound “a-u-m” and not “om.” They are inventing their own versions of the sound. We are not sure on what basis they are chanting in such tunes. However, the way it must be pronounced is clearly defined by the expert grammarians, authors and commentators. These pseudo “intelligent” people consider themselves greater than those specialists and create new tunes. Let them be there. However, when you join ‘a’ and ‘u’, it becomes ‘o:’, not ‘ow’. The next letter is m. There is no vowel next to it. Therefore, it is “mm”. Together, they are pronounced as “om.” Elders defined the method of denoting and chanting it as “om.” Let us follow them. They discussed, elaborate and established meanings of ‘a (first letter)’, ‘m (last letter)’, and ‘u (middle letter)’.\nThe first letter, ‘a’ describes the first entity, or tattva among all the entities, Narayana. This was declared by sages who gave skilled commentaries on grammar.\na: ithi bhagavatho: na:ra:yanasya pradhama: vidha:nam\n‘a’ is Narayana, performing many activities, in various forms, referred to by various names\naka:ra:rdho vishnuhu jagadudaya raksha: pralaya kruth:\nemanating the entire universe from within himself, He resides within, supports every being, and then absorbs everything back into Him\nWhen He feels it is time for re-creation, He manifests all beings out of Himself. We all know what is taken in does not come out in the same form. For example, if we eat fruit, we can vomit it out, but the fruit won’t resemble itself anymore. It is of different form and shape. However, Sri Vishnu emanates objects from within Him, taking them back, and re-emanating them carefully, in the same state that they were taken in. He ensures everyone’s karma (records of past actions), remain intact respectively with them, without any distortion. Therefore, He is known as ‘jagath karana’. Meaning, He is the only one who creates, protects, and destroys.\nIt is not three different entities performing three tasks. It is only One who must perform all three tasks. This is what Veda says.\nyatho: va: im:ani bhu:thani ja:yanthe: ye:na ja:tha:ni ji:vanthi\nyath prayanthy abhisamvisanthi:\nHe brings out from Himself, protects and takes back into Him; when ready, He alone grants souls their permanent abode\nHe is the one and only. The great Telugu poet, Pothana, eloquently explained “evvaniche: janinchu jagamu evvani lopalanundu linamai”, the one who is the cause of the entire existence also carries it within Him. It should be only one Supreme Being doing all these. He is named as Narayana. He is also named Vishnu. He is also named Vasudeva. As per eternal Vedic science, He is also referred to with many other names. He is the first one. All other objects emerging from Him are secondary. Therefore, the first letter is ‘a’ kara. It is from ‘a’ kara that om has emerged. It is from om that Vedas have emerged. It is from Vedas that all the other literature and later other world languages took shape. They all trace back and merge into ‘a’ kara.\n‘A’ kara is adi (first). Narayana is the origin. The substance is Narayana and the sound which explains this substance is ‘a’ kara. Therefore, as they are both firsts, Elders established that both ‘a’ kara and Narayana have a relation: ‘sound and its meaning’ with each other. They clearly state that ‘a’ kara explains Narayana and Narayana is identified by ‘a’ kara. However, what name is used here? “Madhava.” Madhava is one of the two [in the chariot]. Why was the name Madhava used? This reveals that the tattva revealed as ‘a’ karam is not an entity all by Himself. He has ‘ma’ along with Him. ‘Ma’ means Mother. Mother is also joined with Him. As per Veda…\nhri:shchathe: lakshmi:scha pathnyow:\nthe creator of this entire existence, sahasra sirsha purusha (1000 headed being) is the spouse of Lakshmi\nLakshmi is an extraordinary tattva, enhancing God’s compassionate nature. At times, characteristics such as His unquestionable supremacy can suppress His soft side of compassion, empathy etc. Lakshmi Tattva in Him invokes that softer side thereby making Him go easy on us. Lakshmi Tattva is that which tunes Him to be more empathetic, loving and compassionate towards us so that He takes us to the most blissful state. This tattva is referred to as ‘Ma’. He is the spouse of ‘Ma’ and therefore named “Madhava.” Narayana is Madhava! Hence, He is named “Madhavaha.”\nHe is dayanatha (compassionate).\nHe is karunamaya (kind).\nHe is krupamurthi (full of grace).\nHe is Lakshmi pati (spouse of Lakshmi), Sriyah pati (spouse of Sri).\nHe is thus beautifully explained. He is holding a conch. ‘Om’ is composed of the letters ‘a’, ‘u’ and ‘m’. The letter ‘a’ is the conch that is worn, augmented, by Madhava. Thus, God is recognized by ‘a’ kara. The last letter, ‘m’, represents Pandava (Arjuna), as he is holding the conch denoted by ‘m’ karam (all the souls). They both are sounding conches. The meaning of this is being explained to the world.\nWe know Madhava, who is Narayana. Now, He incarnated as Sri Krushna. The second is Pandava, who is named Arjuna. He is sounding one conch. However, there is ‘u’ kara in the middle of om. This explains the unbreakable relation between both. Arjuna belongs only to Madhava and Madhava is showing His grace only for the sake of Arjuna. ‘U’ kara conveys this message. Not this nor any other conch, it simply denotes the connection between Madhava and Pandava. That is why, there are only two people in the chariot, “Madhavah pandavas chaiva.”\nThere is a relationship between them - ‘a’ in ‘a kara’ and ‘m’ in ‘ma kara’. What does ‘m’ say?\nmaka:ra:rdo ji:vaha thadupakaranam vaishnava midam\n‘m’ is jiva (a soul), an instrument in Lord’s hands in relation to Sri Vishnu, Vaishnava midam\nThe relation between God and soul is undetachable. The relation between Arjuna and Madhava is inseparable. ‘U’ karam explains this...\nuka:raha ananya:rham niyama ithi sambandham anayo:ho\nthe eternal relation between both\nOn joining all three, we get A: U: M: (Om) omkara. This is the chariot. One need not think that we are making baseless interpretations of Pandava, jiva, ‘m’ karam etc. We will gradually understand further in our next sessions.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "chapter": 1,
    "episode": 4,
    "content": "Dear devotees... When taking avatharas (incarnations), God's primary objective is to educate people with appropriate knowledge on the purpose of life. Activities performed during these avatharas are in accordance with those respective time periods. One common activity during each avatara (incarnation) is revealing an upadesa (divine message). He manifested as a wild boar (Adi Varaha) at the beginning of this kalpa (time period). He gave an upadesa then. Later, he arrived as Narasimha (half-man, half-lion). He also gifted a divine message then. He descended as Sri Rama and gave an upadesa then as well. He offers a message capturing the essence of each avatara, known as charama sloka (ultimate verse). For each charama sloka, he prepares the backdrop before revealing that divine message. For example, we might want to enjoy the sweet water inside a coconut. However, it is covered with a white flaky substance... ...that in turn is encompassed in fiber-like material... ...which is encapsulated in a green-colored shell...in this manner, a tree offers us the coconut. Similarly, God assembles a nice package before offering a charama sloka. That package is Bhagavad Gita. Its essence, the charama sloka, is chapter 18 verse 66. Everything prior is simply context to help us to grasp that ultimate message properly. Bhagavad Gita has 700 verses, grouped within 18 chapters. Who grouped them into 18 chapters? Was it Sri Krishna? Arjuna? Veda Vyasa? Or was it the great, later historians who distributed them as such? Keeping this discussion aside, we see that the chapters are organized based on relevant topics. The 18 chapters are organized as 18 types of ‘yoga'. The charama sloka embellishes these as a supremely beautiful message. Scholars reveal that this charama sloka is Sri Krishna's ultimate message.\nIn the 4th chapter, God explains that he descended on earth to take care of devotees who are inclined to help society. Those devotees are known as sajjanas, sadhus, or prapannas (faithful ones surrendered to God). ‘Prapanna' is a person who has believed and taken Lord alone as his protector. God arranges whatever is needed for such prapannas. He treats that as His objective for taking an avatara. This act of protection is known as ‘pari tranam'.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = tranam\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = to protect\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = pari tranam\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = complete protection from all sides, in all respects\n\nGod declares this alone is the objective of His avatara..\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = pari-trana:ya sa:dhu:na:m sambhava:mi yuge: yuge:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = descending to protect prapannas, He is also known as ‘prapanna parijatham' (like a flower from a wish fulfilling tree, giving whatever is desired for prapannas)\n\nWhat does he do when descending? Though his primary objective is to protect these devotees, With warnings, He keeps in check evil ones hurting devotees. If they heed the warning, He is pleased. If not, he will make them understand. If necessary, He will administer appropriate punishment so they return to a proper path. Hence, He is referred as vetra thothraikapana ye. He holds the vetra thothram (a horse whip), in his pani (hand). In reality, is this whip meant for horses? Probably not. Why? Sri Krishnaʼs horses did not need to be beaten or reined in to do their job. They precisely understand the ingitham (thoughts), of the chariot driver. They act according to whatever the driver is thinking. Given Sri Krishnaʼs chariotʼs horses are of this nature, the whip in his hand is not meant to direct them. We wonder why is He holding it?\nAlwars (devoted saints originating in South India), reveal that the whip is actually a weapon in disguise.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = or maya por panni\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = though an external weapon to destroy enemies is needless\n\nTo follow this realmʼs rules, He is constantly giving chances, birth after birth. However, if someone has deep faith and interest, Lord connects him with an acharya (teacher) who graces him with Lordʼs name, manthra (sacred syllables) and form. The resulting exchange of divine knowledge liberates both student and teacher. This is generally the case for sajjanas (pious people). However, for those causing disturbances, he assures they are weeded away.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = vina:sa:ya cha dushkrutha:m\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = riddance of enemies is not His primary objective\n\nAs a matter of fact, this happens in the natural course of His primary activities. This is why He is called 'vetra thothraika pa:naye:'. He holds a whip-like object in one hand. A weapon is needless. He holds the whip simply to follow the rules of this world. Alwar says, “is this necessary for You, O Lord?” “Simply for the guise of warfare, you do so, but it is not actually needed.” “It is used to misguide all the warriors, as if you need to control the horses.” “A forward whiplash annihilates the army in front. A backward whiplash eliminates the army behind.” “Like this, you are the one who conducted the entire war.”\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = maya ppo:r panni\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = normally, we say “I did” or “I made it happen”\n\nHe did not make the war happen. He, Himself, conducted the entire war! All others present were mere instruments. He confirmed with Arjuna...\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = nimittha-ma:thram bhava, savyasa:chin\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = a mere instrument, Arjuna (savyasachin)\n\nThus, with the power of incredible sankalpa (intention), without prejudice, God performed a wonderful act of eliminating everyone fighting in that war. The riding whip in His hand indicates the act of punishing evil. His primary activity is prapanna parijathaya – like a flower from a wish fulfilling tree, giving whatever is desired for prapannas.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = ve:thra tho:thraika pa:naye:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = in his other hand, You are holding the riding whip to properly steer the evil ones\n\n“Not to control evil – you hold the whip to control our senses!”\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = jna:na mudra:ya krushna:ya\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = after removing evil, He bestows knowledge to prapannas\n\nAs if holding a whip, He is actually displaying ‘jnana mudra' (posture of knowledge dissemination). This is a beautiful posture, known by many names jnana mudra / chin-mudra / atma-mudra. He teaches righteous activities to the world with this posture. This indicates jiva (showing the index finger). It is called tharjani - the one which threatens. We are the ones threatening everybody else. Right? Others are scared looking at us. That is our ability. Hence, this tharjani denotes us. This is called ‘angushta' (showing the thumb).\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = angushttah ma:thrah purushaha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = the thumb denotes God\n\nThis finger is assigned to us (showing the index finger). The remaining three fingers refer to prakruthi (nature). The three gunas (attributes), present in prakruthi – rajas, thamas, satthva - are indicated by these. The jiva (soul) has to be pulled away from these three. He should continue to live with prakruthi, but turn away from it, surrendering to God, with head bowed down. That respectful bowing needs to be done by the jiva. Since this posture reminds the jiva of his duty, it is termed ‘chin mudra'. As it gives necessary knowledge, it is also termed ‘jnana-mudra'. Since it asserts the innate nature of atma (soul), it is called ‘atma-mudra'. Lord is displaying this mudra with His hand holding the riding whip. Jijnasus (knowledge-seekers) recognize this posture. jnana mudra:ya krushna:ya. This mudra also serves another purpose. He is milking the essence from all Vedas and offering it to us.\nVedas are like the milk-yielding cows and this posture indicates the process of giving the essence. He milked the elixir of Gita and gave it to all of us. Let's accept and enjoy this. Let us all pass on this elixir to all our near and dear. To teach us this, God unveiled His form as a charioteer, holding the riding whip. He gave us the elixir of Bhagavad Gita. Let's dive into that elixir and enjoy the essence to some extent.\n\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya bhagavad bandhus, ...\nVedas emerged from Omkara. Omkara is termed pranava. It is known for nada (the sound it produces). Therefore, it is referred to as Pranava Nada (the sound of ‘Om’). Omkaram is symbolically compared to Sankha (conch) because similar sounds are produced. In addition, Sankha resembles Om in shape. If we write the word ‘Omkaram’ in either Telugu or Nagari script, it resembles a sankha shape. These reasons are probably why Sankha is symbolically compared to Omkaram.\nBhagavad Gita, chapter 1 sloka 14, explains there are two people on a chariot. One is Madhava, the other is Pandava. Each holds a conch. We learned that the chariot represents Omkara. Madhava and Pandava are Sri Krushna and Arjuna. The 2 conches they hold are 2 primary letters in Omkaram, ‘a’ and ‘m’. The letter ‘m’ represents souls and the letter ‘a’ represents God. He and us. The letter ‘a’ represents Him. The letter ‘m’ represents us.\nOne may feel this is illogical, questionable. That’s not necessary. ‘A’ represents Him, a well-known being, the universal cause. He is akara ardham (the meaning of ‘a’). Why? He is the protector of the entire universe. ‘A’ also denotes protection. ‘Ava rakshe’ is the root of ‘a karam’ in Sanskrit. A word used in describing a person should be qualified to describe that person. Narayana is the protector and the cause. He has these qualities. Similarly, ‘a’ is the first letter, the source and reason for all letters, carrying and protecting all of them with and within it. Every letter merges into ‘a’ and every letter emerges from ‘a’. Linguists have declared this. ‘A’ and Narayana have similar qualities, and therefore, are related. Hence, ‘a’ represents Him, Narayana, God.\nThen how does ‘m’ denote us?\nNature can be classified as sthavara (immobile) or jangama (mobile). Numerologists have identified each substance by a few letters. We all know a big chart of elements that began with 105 elements. It increased to 109 and then to approximately 129 elements today. However, Elders, the wise, did not make as many classifications. They classified everything into only 25 categories. Everything we see is formed by five elements - earth, water, fire, wind, and space. They mapped a set of 25 letters, each representing an element. All those 25 letters, from ‘ka’ to ‘ma’, were grouped into 5 rows with 5 letters in each.\n'Ka' group – Ka:, Kha:, Ga:, Gha:, Nya\n'Cha' group - Ch:, Cha:, Ja:, Jha:, Ini\n'Ta' group - Ta, Ta:, Da, Da:, Na,\n'Tha' group – Tha, Tha:, Dha, Dha:, Na:\n'Pa' group – Pa, Pha:, Ba, Bha: Ma\nA total of 25 letters, five groups containing five letters each. Based on an alphabet’s embedded power, realising the innate quality of an element, each element is represented by one letter. Space is symbolized by the letter Ka:. Earth is symbolized by the letter Na:. Air is symbolized by the letter Ga:. Fire is symbolized by the letter Gha:. As fire gives heat, it is referred to as Gha:. As the sky shines, it is referred to as Ka:. As earth inculcates ignorance, it is referred to as Nya:. These are symbolic representations. The same applies for the rest. So, the five elements of nature are represented by the ‘Ka’ family.\nWe have 5 jnana indriyas (sensory organs). What are they? Eyes to see a form, ears to listen, nose to smell, tongue to taste and skin to touch. These are called jnanendriyas (sensory organs). These five are represented by Ch:, Cha:, Ja:, Jha:, Ini. We have 5 karma indriyas (organs to perform work) - mouth to speak, hands to work, legs to walk, and excretory/urinary organs. These five are represented by Ta, Ta:, Da, Da:, Na. There are five qualities associated with the five elements of nature. Earth has a smell. Water has taste. Fire has color. Wind can be felt. Space makes sound audible. These 5 are termed vishayas (experienceable natural qualities). They are represented by the five letters of the ‘Tha’ family - Tha, Tha:, Dha, Dha:, Na:.\nThen, the letter ‘Pa’ is used to indicate manas (subtle mind), the inner organ. ‘Pha’ indicates buddhi (intellect), which is the base for the manas. Mahath tattva (a greater element) guides the intellect. The root of mahath tattva is aham tattva (the ego) and is represented by ‘Ba’. The root element of all this is called mula prakriti and is indicated by ‘Bha’. This completes the 24 natural elements. These are the 24 sounds (letters) that define all substances in nature. Whether the most minute particle or massive substance, all elements belong to one of these 24 elements. Even a tiny micron, or even further, the most microscopic, smallest particle, also belongs within one of the 24 elemental categories. Our body is also composed of these 24 elements.\nIf we assume the body, made of these 24 elements, as a throne, then the person who sits on this throne is jiva (a soul), indicated by the 25th letter. That 25th letter is ‘ma kara’ (‘m’). Makara indicates jiva, a soul. Why? Why is jiva represented by ‘ma’ and not ‘ka’? As we discussed previously, codes and their corresponding entities should have similar characteristics. Knowledge is an essential characteristic of a soul, and none of the 24 elements have inherent knowledge. These 24 elements are analogous to a machine. Jiva (soul), is analogous to a battery powering this machine. Knowledge is an inherent power which the soul possesses. All 24 elements work only if the soul possessing knowledge resides within. None of those elements work independently without the jiva. Therefore, a soul is one who has knowledge and who is knowledge.\nThe corresponding root words in Sanskrit that describes this is\nman jna:ne:\nmanu avabodhane:\nThus, the letter ‘Ma’ can be used to represent the soul. From the letter ‘Ka’ to ‘Ma’, the 25th letter, each letter indicates an element. ‘Ma’ indicates soul. Therefore, ‘ma’ means jiva (soul), the 25th letter. The sound of ‘Om’, has the sound of ‘a’ representing Narayana and the sound of ‘ma’ representing jiva, a soul.\nJiva, represented by a letter in Omkaram, is also a sankhadhari (one holding a conch). Though we are all souls, we do not have pure knowledge. Our knowledge has been contaminated in many ways. In Sanskrit language, flawless knowledge is termed as panda. Panda translates to clean, pure knowledge. Those who possess sanctified knowledge are termed Pandu. The son of this Pandu is referred to as Pandava. This means Pandava is one who is in a lineage of pure knowledge. It is not easy for people like us with contaminated knowledge to sound the conch in the same tone as pranava nada. It is only possible for those with pure knowledge. We should take them as a model. Therefore, the sound of ‘ma’ in ’Om’ refers to the soul with pure, clean knowledge.\n‘A’, ‘Ma’\nGod, soul\nNarayana, jnani (soul possessing purified knowledge)\nA jnani is one with sanctified knowledge like an alwar, or acharyas in a lineage. Such great jnanis represent ‘ma’. The letter ‘u’ [between ‘a’ and ‘m’] represents the imperishable bond between God and Soul. The relation between God and soul is everlasting. This is explained by ‘u karam’. God and soul cannot exist without each other. God does not exist without jiva and jiva does not exist without God. Pranava (Om) does not form without ‘a’ (God) or ‘m’ (Jiva). Thus, they are interdependent on each other and one cannot exist without the other. God never leaves jiva, yet, jiva is not God. Both ‘a’ and ‘m’ are not the same, they are different. However, they have an everlasting relationship. Veda declares that jiva will never become God. However, a jiva can become like God.\n\nSLOKA WORD - de:ho deva:laya pro:ktaha, ji:vo de:va sana:thanaha SLOKA MEANING - Many people ignorantly claim that one becomes God after leaving this body, they claim jiva is God Himself.\nThat is wrong. One can never become God, yet, one can become as great as God. As we progress in Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krushna Himself says...\n\nSLOKA WORD - mama sa:dharmya magatha:ha sadge:pa no:paja:yanthe pralaye:na vyadanthi cha SLOKA MEANING - one can become as great as me\nIf one’s impediments and impurities shrouding jnanam are cleared, pure knowledge will shine brilliantly and he will become the abode of true bliss similar to God. It does not mean he will become God. Rather, he will attain eternal union with God. As per Bhagavad Gita, they are in the same ‘Pranavam’ chariot, thus, their eternal bond should be known and understood by Pranavam. It explains that the soul, represented by ‘ma kara’ (‘m’) should be God’s instrument.\nmaka:ra:rdo ji:vaha thadupakaranam vaishnavan\nhe should be an instrument held by God\nOne should always remember this. At the outset of the war, Arjuna thought that he was the one who would fight, these people would die, he would gain virtue, he may commit sins, etc. Later, after listening to the entire Bhagavad Gita, he realized properly, and declared himself as Sri Krushna’s disciple.\nkarishye: vachanam thava\nwithout question, I will follow your instruction\nyathra pa:rdha dhanurdharaha\nimplementing Sri Krushna’s orders, Arjuna picked up the bow that he initially threw down\nHe became an instrument of Krushna. He followed Krushna’s orders and did exactly what he was instructed. A soul is never independent. He does not possess abilities independently to serve his purpose. One should remember this. You are an instrument in the hands of God, thus, behave like one. An instrument is never independent and is never selfish. An instrument is always subservient to its owner. It works for the purpose of the owner in the way he desires. It works because of its owner. If a jiva realizes this, that is enough. God is the leader. I belong to God. I am His instrument. I work for His purpose. I will offer all my activities to Him. This is the gist explained by Sri Krushna in Bhagavad Gita. If we understand this, we grasp the entire Bhagavad Gita. Establishing this as a base, we need to relate the content of all the other chapters. Therefore, if we grasp this 14th verse - thatha swethair hayair yukthe: then we understand the entire Bhagavad Gita. If not, no matter what else is understood, it is not comprehensive.\nSanjaya gave this divine inner message by embedding it in a small verse. The knowledge of the sages is so clear and crisp. We should be ever grateful for the benevolence of acharyas’ desire to enrich us through the wealth of knowledge which has reached us so beautifully. Let’s proceed and realise this further.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya bhagavad bandhus,\nThe nature and attitude of a person determine his perception towards his surroundings. There is a saying - those affected with jaundice see everything as yellow. Similarly, when a person feels a certain way about something, he assumes that everyone else feels similarly. If one is a coward, one would feel scared of God too. If a loving person, even an enemy will become the recipient of that love. Therefore, one should never have hatred in one’s mind. If we radiate love towards everything, the atmosphere around us becomes congenial. If we have hatred in our heart, we cannot perceive the goodness of those around us. Even a snake does not bite if it comes across any satvik (good) person.\nIn the past, sages lived cohesively with lions and tigers in ashrams (spiritual hermitages). Animals didn’t harm them because sages only had benevolence towards all creatures. Sages never hate anything. They exude positive thoughts towards everyone and equally respect all beings. Because they treated all beings as equal in terms of their connection with God, they did not react based on physical appearance or body type. If a human develops goodness within, he or she is able to spread that goodness around his or her surroundings. If a human develops selfishness within, then his selfishness can spread to surroundings.\nVeda says...\nyada: vrukshasya sampushpi thasya, du:ra:th gandho: va:thi\nthe fragrance of a blossomed flower is not limited to that flower alone, it spreads all around\nIf a flower produces a nice fragrance, it spreads that same nice fragrance. If an object stinks, it spreads this odor, overwhelming the qualities of those surrounding areas. Similarly, a noble person with kindness within, will spread only goodwill to everyone around. If the person allows negative thoughts to inculcate, then that person will only create negative impacts on the surroundings. Therefore, nature is considered a mirror. We only see a reflection of ourselves. A mirror reflects the same feeling we carry within us. If we look at a mirror lovingly, then it reflects our face with love. If we look at a mirror with a crying face, then it reflects the same crying face. Similarly, whatever we feel towards nature, the same feeling will be reflected with a multifold magnitude. Thus, if we find ourselves constantly complaining about flaws everywhere, we need to realize that there are flaws within ourselves.\nTopics related to God will automatically enhance joy within God’s devotees. The same causes hatred and anger in those who hate God. God has weapons as well as ornaments. For devotees, even these weapons seem like ornaments. Therefore, when devotees see God with these weapons or ornaments, they are concerned about any evil eye that may affect the beauty of God. An ornament enhances one’s beauty. Similarly, when God is adorned with Sankha (conch), and Chakra (discus), Gadha (mace) and Khadgam (machete), His beauty grows multifold. Afraid of the evil eye, Alwars (realized saints) offer mangala asasanams (blessings for healthy longevity) by singing -\npalla:ndu palla:ndu, pal a:yi rattha:ndu, pala ko:ti nu:ra:yiram\nWhen reaching such a state of offering mangalasasanam to Lord, they forget themselves. Generally, while speaking, we follow a logical sequence. Numerically, we count - one, hundred, thousand, lakh, crore etc., as the order indicates increment or decrement. However, those immersed in love lose track of sequence, they mix it up. They lose sense of what’s up and what’s down.\nOf the Alwars, there is one who realized the love of God more profoundly than anyone else. By the way, who are Alwars? Those great devotees who are completely immersed in God’s love. They became deeply immersed in God’s love and emerged with a devotional intensity that they could not contain within themselves, and thus, shared with everyone. There were 12 Alwars, and all sang eloquently, eulogising God. Language is not an obstacle for those singing about God, they sing in whatever language they know. Language is neither a standard, nor a hurdle. It is compared to a plate holding a meal. The contents on the plate are more important than the plate itself. It might be made of silver, gold, clay, porcelain, glass, a leaf, paper, or it may be someone’s hand. The contents of the plate have more importance than the type of plate holding them. This is similar for language. When relishing a subject matter’s essence, we respect the language for being the carrier of that essence. Alwars sang in Dravida language. Even though all Alwars sang, Periyalvar is revered as the top most because of his immense love towards God.\nLove also causes fear - the fear of losing one’s object of love. When we love someone or something, we desire to safeguard it from trouble. We always keep it safe, at times not even letting anyone touch it. The great devotee, Periyalvar, also named Vishnuchittha, the father of our very own Goda Devi, loved God immensely and sang for God. Once, God arrived to see him. Vishnuchitta noticed his glory and began singing some slokas (verses) as a shield of protection, like a mother protecting her children from evil through various means. As he was singing, he thought about the time-period to protect God with these melodious blessings. A doctor prescribes medicine with a dosage frequency, every several hours, or once daily, etc. Similarly, Vishnuchitta wanted to express the length of protection. He wanted it for so many years, exclaiming pal (many) andu (years)! However, that wasn’t enough.\npalla:ndu\nhe added more years, but he still was not content\npal a:yi rathha:ndu\nHe added several thousands of years, but felt stingy! Only thousands?\npala ko:ti\nhe added crores (10s of millions) of years, but then...\nnu:ru\nhundreds of years, then...\na:yiram\nagain, thousands of years\nHe went up, then down, then up again! Thousands, then crores, then hundreds, then thousands! His heart could not feel satisfaction with any specific amount of time. Only after deciding on a time-period can one sing mangalam (well-wishes) stating for how long. However, he couldn’t give a number because there was no contentment with limiting it to a specific time period.\npall a:ndu - pall a:ndu - palla:yi rattha:ndu\npala ko:ti - nu:ru - a:yiram\nLike this, he commenced offering auspicious wishes to God, concerned about ‘evil eye’ that may affect Lord’s beauty. What beauty? The beauty of God holding weapons, including Sankha and Chakra. He recognized Sankha and Chakra as beauty enhancing ornaments, rather than weapons. As he is a devotee and loves God, he sees beauty and feels happy in any aspect related to God. Everything adds beauty, and thus, he feels the need to protect all those ornaments. However, these same weapons create fear, palpitations in the hearts of those who hate God. Hence, the same Sankha and Chakra which invoked wishes of love from devotees like Vishnuchitta and his daughter Goda Devi, caused enemies to flee out of fear.\nIn Bhagavad Gita chapter one, we see the same divine aspects giving happiness to devotees like Pandavas, inculcating fear in detractors like Duryodhana. We see this in chapter 1, sloka 19. What happened? The Kaurava commander-in-chief, Bhishma, sounded his conch to invigorate his side. All the warriors followed Bhishma and sounded their conches simultaneously. As a response, Pandavas also sounded their conches. It’s interesting, the first to sound His conch from Pandavas was Hrushikesa (Sri Krushna) using His conch, Panchajanya.\npa:nchajanyam hrushi:ke:sha\nHrushikesa sounded His conch, Panchajanya\nWe don’t know how long it resonated. It started with Panchajanya, then Devadatta (Arjuna's conch), then Anantha Vijayam (Yudhistira’s conch) and in sequence, conches of other Pandava leaders followed.\npruthak pruthak\nthe resonance continued by each warrior individually, in an organized fashion\nIt went on for so long that it scared all Kauravas. In the 19th sloka, Sanjaya explained to Dhrutarashtra the extent of that fear.\n\nSLOKA WORD - sa gho:sho: dha:rthara:shtra:na:m hrudaya:ni vyada:rayath | nabhas cha prutthivi:m chaiva thumulo::py anuna:dayan || SLOKA MEANING - The sound of all the conches echoing through Earth and space should affect everyone similarly. However, it did not.\ndhartarashtranam hridayani vyadayat\nSanjaya said, “Hey Dhrutarashtra, all your relatives, your son Suyodhana (Duryodhana), and his army are all Dhartarashtras.”\ndhartarashtranam hridayani vyadayat\nwith sinking hearts, they quivered with fear\nWhy did the same sound not have the same effect on Pandavas? If it stirred fear in one, it must do the same for the rest, right? It gave happiness to Pandavas, but shattered the hearts of Kauravas. At the same moment, Sanjaya concluded, “Your people no longer have absolutely any chance of winning the war.” Basically, Dhrutarashtra was blind in every way. Nothing registered, nor did he respond.\nWe need to understand the reason why this nadam (sound) caused fear only in Kauravas. Let’s continue in our next sessions.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus,\nChapter 1 and 2 of Bhagavad Gita are crucial. If we understand these two initial chapters thoroughly, we grasp the entire Bhagavad Gita. If a foundation is strong, we can lay multiple floors. Otherwise, the whole building will collapse. Similarly, if these foundational chapters are not understood correctly, the rest of the chapters will hold no value. We are attempting to learn the essence of chapter 1.\nIn chapter 1, three people were in grief. First was Dhrutarashtra, second was Duryodhana, and the third was Arjuna.\nDhrutarashtra was in grief because he wanted only his sons as heirs to the kingdom. He wanted them to get the kingdom without any struggle. He desired the downfall of the Pandavas (the sons of his brother, Pandu). By hook or by crook, he desired for his sons to happily rule the entire kingdom. Though Sanjaya, a great devotee and intelligent person, narrated the Bhagavad Gita exactly as he heard it, it made no difference to Dhrutarashtra as his intentions were bad.\ngirayaha varshadha:ra:bhihi\nas rocks are not impacted by rain, Dhrutarashtra remained unaffected by Bhagavad Gita\nThis was Dhrutarashtra. Next was Duryodhana. He was consumed by fear. He approached and sought the wise Dronacharya. However, he had no interest in actually being guided. He instructed Dronacharya, hurt his feelings, and went on his way. The result - Duryodhana not only lost his army but became the reason for his own destruction. He was thus known to be a wicked person.\nHowever, Arjuna was different. Though he was also arrogant, he remained humble when approaching his guru, God Himself. He was interested to hear from his guru. He had a heart capable of comprehending what was being told. Thus, he has become a model for us. Arjuna was the one with the desire to follow God’s instructions. In fact, we don’t know if Arjuna had sincere desire or not, but Bhagavan Sri Krushna sowed the seed. Chapter 1 of Bhagavad Gita explains it clearly.\nWhere? Let’s ask a few questions before going further. Bhagavad Gita upadesam (the divine message) began just before the war commenced. First question, would valiant warriors, ready for war, stay quiet while two people are having a deep, thoughtful conversation? Second, can these two hear each other clearly through the din of a battlefield? Can one understand Vedanta (the essence of all Vedic wisdom), despite being scared of being attacked from all sides? As a hungry man cannot stay focused on Vedanta, those ready for war also cannot focus on it. With Arjuna in a similar mood, how did Sri Krushna deliver this grand upadesa? What were the others doing? What happened to them? How much time did Bhagavad Gita upadesa take? We wonder about all these questions. All these questions were answered in chapter one and two with just one word. Hrishikesha. It is a very beautiful word. It is seen in chapter 1 right when the divine conches were sounded. It reappears in the second chapter and continues until the upadesa begins for Arjuna. It appears later on as well.\nThis word is very important. Why? In fact, Arjuna also had pride. He was also arrogant. However, He was better than the rest. It is said, “All are devils but choose a better devil!” All these warriors were the same, but Sri Krushna chose a better one, Arjuna. As Arjuna was relatively stable compared to the others, Sri Krushna chose him as an instrument to bestow the greatest divine message to the world.\npardho vatsaha sudhihi bhoktha\na calf is used to initially suckle, enabling a cowherd boy to begin milking who takes 3 portions and leaves 1 portion for the calf\nSimilarly, God intended to use Arjuna as a calf to draw the milk of Gita for all those who are interested in relishing it. Hence, He created a situation such that Arjuna must question Him. Such divine knowledge should not be revealed without it being sought. Only then He revealed tattva (fundamental supreme truth) as if responding to Arjuna’s question. He created such a situation where Arjuna felt the need to ask a question. The beautiful word explaining this situation is Hrishikesha.\nWhere was it used? Once, Kauravas finished sounding their conches following Bhishma’s lead, Pandavas followed their leader, Hrishikesha.\npanchajanyam hrishikesaha\nafter, He sounded the divine conch, Panchajanyam\nWhen God first does something, everyone else is simply part of it. Sri Krushna’s divine conch, Panchajanya, was the conch that was initially sounded. This was what shattered the hearts of Kauravas. Anything related to God gives happiness to devotees. Hence, Pandavas, being devoted to Sri Krushna, were delighted and energized further with the sound from Lord’s divine conch. However, the same sound scared Kauravas, making them feel like they had already lost the war. Sanjaya confirmed the same.\nhrudayani vyadayat\nthe hearts of all your sons are shattered\nHe clearly told Dhrutarashtra that it was hopeless for his sons now, expecting he would understand and ask them to return. Nope. Dhrutarashtra is not one to do such a thing. This means that anything associated with God gives happiness to devotees and sadness to rogues. Ultimately, that’s what happened. Hrishikesha sounded His divine conch, reverberating that divine sound! His name was Hrishikesha.\nWhat does this mean?\nhrushikas - isudu - niyamakudu\nthe commander of the hrishikas (senses) is God\nWhat is meant by hrushikas?\nhrushyathe: harshayathi ithi hrushika\nthesham isaha hrusheka isaha\nhrushyathe: harshayathi\nhrushyathe: bringing joy when seeing others\nharshayathi: bringing joy to the one possessing\nThis is what our senses do. For example, when our eye sees something attractive, it enjoys the experience. It does not stop there. It stimulates the manas to send information to its owner, the jivatma (soul). We know there are 5 senses which enable vision, smell, taste, hearing and touch. Our manas (mind) is the kallem (regulator), for all 5 senses, directing them along one course. We don’t want the 5 senses going in 5 different directions. These 5 senses are like 5 horses to the chariot. We need to ensure they work in a systematized manner. Thus, we need the regulator, manas (mind), which controls all 5 senses. The jiva (soul), appoints buddhi (intellect), as the charioteer to drive the ‘chariot’ the body. The senses are like the five horses. We have five such horses in the body. Sri Krushna’s chariot has only 4 horses. However, our body is represented as a chariot with 5 horses, the 5 senses.\nThe senses always get harsham (exultation), when they see something attractive to them. Thus, the senses are called hrishikas. When the eye sees an attractive shape, it enjoys it and then relays to the manas which in turn offers it buddhi, which then passes it to atma. Then atma relishes it. Atma then encourages the eye to see it more and more. Similarly, when the ear, the sensory organ termed sravanendriyam (shrotrendriyam), hears some wonderful sound, assumes it to be a koyal’s koo-oo and yearns to listen to it again and again. Hearing the sound, the ear enjoys and makes its owner, the jivatma, also happy. Thus, it is known as a hrishikam. Similarly, the nose also smells something nice and transmits it to the jivatma. As it experiences something pleasant and sends it to us, we also enjoy the experience. Similar for the tongue, rasana indriyam. It enjoys the taste first, and then makes it’s owner (us) happy by conveying the experience. All these 5 senses are thus, hrishikas.\nWho is the head of all the senses? Oneself. I want to see, so my eye is seeing. I want to listen, so my ear listens. I want to taste, so my tongue is tasting. I want to touch, so my hand touches. We feel as if we are isa (the controller) of the senses. Are we the isa for our senses? Are we hrishikesha? No. Not at all. We think that the senses are working as per our instructions. Not at all. At one stage, our karmic imprints drive the senses. Karma is the isa for the senses. Truly, even karma is under the jurisdiction of God. He is the hrishika (senses), isa (controller). Not just for yours and my senses, He is the isa for all beings. The jiva thinks that he is controlling the senses due to false ego, but this is not reality. One may want to read a book. However, the eyes close and the reader falls asleep automatically after some time without one’s knowledge. If you are isa of the senses and they listen to you, then you should decide when to sleep or be awake. Is that the case? Similarly, are you smelling only when you want to smell and restricting it when you don’t want to? Is it possible? Same with all the senses. Are they in our control? It seems so, but in reality, they are not. We are not hrishikeshas. There is someone driving us from behind. He is Hrishika Isa. God rightly possesses that name. He drives the narrative from start to end. How? Let’s learn in our next session.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus,\nDear devotees…\nIn Bhagavad Gita, God utilized each word cautiously. Sanjaya accurately repeated the same. Sri Veda Vyasa Maharshi offered it to all of us via Sriman Maha Bharata. We should take note of the marvels in the first chapter. To narrate what the Lord said, Sanjaya used the precise phrase – ‘Sri Bhagavan Uvacha’. In the instances where he wants to depict God’s divine activities or people in respect to them, he utilizes relevant descriptive words. Such words are used with an intention to convey a specific mood. If one attempts to recognize this, then its beauty can be experienced. Otherwise, it becomes a common reading experience.\nHrishikesha is the name used for Sri Krushna when the conches are sounded. In the earlier verse, we talked about two names, Madhava and Pandava, as well as the intent of using those two names to refer to Sri Krushna and Arjuna respectively. Similarly, Hrishikesha is another word used with specific intention. Why? It addresses questions we may have. What are they? Why was philosophy being discussed right at the outset of war? What were the others doing while this discussion was occurring? Were they seated, quietly attentive, like students in a class? That cannot be the case. So, if everyone is active, how did an undisturbed conversation occur? How did Sanjaya listen to all of it and convey it as it is without any challenge? Such questions may arise in our minds. The response to every one of these questions is Hrishikesha.\nHrishikesha is one who controls senses. Sri Krishna controls the senses of all beings. Once Arjuna starts to fight, all chances for the Gita to be delivered would be lost. If that happens, Sri Krushna will not have an opportunity to convey what He intended to. The primary purpose of Sri Krushna avatara (incarnation) was to deliver this divine message. That purpose would have been defeated. Therefore, He chose to use the time ahead of battle to deliver His message. It is recommended not to advise anyone without having been requested. Thus, He had to make Arjuna ask Him so He could deliver the message. To do so, He began controlling Arjuna’s senses. What did He do? Arjuna wanted to wage war, and was fully prepared to do so. How do we know this? Verse 20 clearly states so.\n\nSLOKA WORD - attha vyavastthitha:n drushtwa: dha:rthara:shtra:n kapidhwajaha | pravrutthe: sasthra sampa:the: dhanur udyamya pa:ndavaha || SLOKA MEANING - Hrishikesha is one who controls senses. Sri Krishna controls the senses of all beings. Once Arjuna starts to fight, all chances for the Gita to be delivered would be lost.

How do we know this? Verse 20 clearly states so.\nhrushi:ke:sam thada: va:kyam idama:ha mahi:pathe:\nhey Mahipate (Dhrutarashtra) - Pandava spoke thus with Hrishikesha\nDhanuhu Udhyamya\nhoisting his bow, the Gandiva\nPravrutthe: sasthra sampa:the\nwhen the firing of weapons was about to commence\nWhat was he doing, who was he?\nKapi dhwajaha\non whose chariot is there a flag with Hanuman on it? Arjuna's!\nAfter doing what?\nDrushtwa:\nafter glancing\nAt whom?\nDhartharashtran\nat all the Kauravas\nHow are they?\nVyavastthitan\nall arrayed and assembled in their positions\nThis was the scene. Kauravas were prepared for war as they sounded their conches, assuming their respective positions ready to fight. As Kapi Dhwaja (Arjuna) saw all of them, he was inspired to say something. Until then, he did not feel this. He was only inspired to fight. But now he was inspired to do something else.\ndhanurudyamya\nhe was holding up the bow, ready to fight, and then felt something different\nWhy?\nBecause Hrishikesha, Sri Krushna, was next to him. Sri Krishna felt, “if Arjuna begins to shoot arrows, then all chances are lost. Let’s pause this situation.” Thus, He began exercising Hrishikeshatva (His ability to control senses of all beings). What happened then? Arjuna felt like he needed to say something. What did he say?\narjuna uvacha\nhe said the following\nHe never thought he would say something like this. He was under the influence of something beyond His control. What was it?\nsenayor ubhayor madhye: rattham stthapaya me:chutha! |\nyavad etan nirikshe:ham yoddhukaman avastthitan ||\nArjuna was requesting Achyutha (Sri Krushna), to take the chariot between the two armies assembled in the battlefield. Why?\nyavad etan nirikshe:ham yoddhukaman avastthitan\nto observe all the warriors together\nArjuna knows who the commander-in-chief and prime warriors on the other side are. Then, why did he feel the need to examine the situation? Let’s see what he asked.\nyavad etan nirikshe:ham yoddhukaman avastthitan\nI want to see all those assembled to fight\nWho do you want to see?\nkair maya: saha yoddhavyam asmin rana samudyame: ||\nyotsyamanan avekshe:ham ya etethra samagathaha |\nThere are two ways in which he expressed it.\nkair maya: saha, kair saha\nto assess who we have in our own army\nyotsyamanan avekshe:ham ya etethra samagathaha\nto see who have assembled to fight against us\ndhartharashtrasya durbuddheh yuddheh priya chikirshavaha\nthose here to please Dhrutarashtra’s son, Suyodhana, are on the opposite side\nHe expressed that he wanted to see those on his side and those on the opposite side. He asked for the chariot to be positioned for that purpose. Hrishikeshatva (the ability to control the senses of any being), is taking another form.\nThe first form of Hrishikeshatva was seen when sounding the conches. He sounded them in a way to weaken the hearts of Dhrutarashtra’s army. We discussed what Hrishikeshatva means. It is the ability to control the senses of all beings. What did that ability do? It immobilized the entire army. Kauravas and their army stood still like statues, in fear. When one pauses and mutes a movie on tv, everything remains ‘still’ in the exact posture at that time.\nSimilarly, once Kauravas were struck by fear, they stood still. Arjuna wanted to see them in whatever position they were in. Pandavas were also still, however, happy and energized. Kauravas stood like statues, struck with fear. Pandavas became like statues, out of happiness. Hrishikesha, He controlled all the senses. None of them had control over their own senses. We too don’t have control of our senses. The senses don’t listen to us. We think we have control. You may say you are closing eyes or shutting the ears or mouth whenever you need to. You may call this control but we are using senses with conditioned freedom. It is not absolute freedom, but it is conditioned freedom just like a fish in a pond. It looks as if a fish is freely swimming in an aquarium. However, can the fish leave it? No. It has glass walls on all the four sides, top and bottom. The freedom it experiences is between four glass walls, nothing beyond those boundaries. Your senses are the same way. God has restricted the freedom of the senses. Even if one does sadhana (practice) to overcome it, it’s only possible to some extent. We won’t be able to enjoy absolute freedom at any time while in this body. God controls everyone’s senses, irrespective of who or what type of being. Not only for Kauravas and Pandavas, He controlled the senses of everyone, including devatas (celestial beings) and sages gathered to witness the battle. Everyone except Arjuna.\nSimilar to YouTube, when we have a messaging mechanism in place, we can selectively have a private chat or broadcast it to all. Similarly, Sri Krushna left Arjuna’s senses functional to the extent necessary. Everyone else’s senses were disabled. Therefore, no matter how long the conversation was, everyone else remained still. Understanding this kind of Hrishikeshatva, answers all our earlier questions. What was everyone doing? They were all muted, i.e. still mode. Why would everyone who came to fight remain quiet during this conversation? Because they were all muted, i.e. still mode. Would they all understand the philosophy? Because they were in still mode, it is not required that they understand anything. They remained still and the two had their conversation. The communication between the two was uninterrupted, without distortion. The answer for all the questions lies in this single name of God, Hrishikesha! What else can Hrishikesham do? Let’s find out further.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nGod does not work the way we do. He does not communicate with people as depicted in movies, with a magical appearance, \"Oh, dear devotee, I am pleased with your penance. I will grant you a boon, ask for it.\" He need not work that way. He accomplishes things through His will.\nthadaikshatha bahusya:m praja:ey: ya:\nsimply with a wish, an intention, He does everything.\nsathyathyakcha: bhavath\nniruktam cha anirukstam cha nilayanam cha anilayanum cha\nsatyam cha: anrutham cha\nsatyam abhavat yadidam kimcha:th\nIf He desires, the entire animate and inanimate existence will appear and dissolve in a second. One day He wished to teach us a lesson. He allowed the manifestation of Coronavirus, let it spread globally and helped us all come to a realization. However, will this realization sustain or resemble a dog’s tail, always reverting to its original state? Only time will tell. If we mend our ways, then we are fortunate and God’s efforts are successful.\nHowever, it is unlikely as we think we can outsmart Him. Hence, God ends up incarnating repeatedly. Alas! We don’t know how many times He incarnated to date, but why does He do this?\nna: hitham vakratha:m dhruvam, na jaha:thi\nthe crookedness of a dog’s tail will never straighten\nThe dog’s tail is straight as long as it is tied to a stick; it again curves as soon as the stick is removed. People follow rules only when a lockdown is in effect. Once lifted, they are prone to abusing guidelines again. The world experienced this. Man’s mind is fickle, hence, God incarnates multiple times and makes tireless efforts. Sri Vishnu Sahasranama Stotra refers to God as anirvinnaha:. 'Nirvinna' means disappointment. He does not have this quality. God is ever optimistic. He is not a pessimist. He gives us chance after chance, even if it means by dint of fear. God works constantly and tirelessly.\nHe looks forward to give us ultimate knowledge. He puts efforts into creating an amicable environment to do so. This has been occurring since time immemorial. God’s efforts are unrelenting. Therefore, at the end of Dwapara Yuga, he felt responsible to provide a sheath in the form of Bhagavad Gita to all those who desire to enrich themselves in Kali Yuga. Does Bhagavad Gita work for everyone? If one is given an umbrella in the rain, not everyone will use it. Some may prefer dancing in the rain. Some may prefer to just gaze at the rain, even if it disrupts their schedule. Some would use the umbrella to carry on with their duties. For such people, an umbrella becomes essential.\nIt’s for those who are determined to do their duties despite any obstacle, without any rancor, that He wanted to give a tool. This sheath cannot be in a physical form. We also can design a physical sheath or tool. That protective shield must be composed of knowledge. Hence, in the end of Dwapara Yuga, He provided us with Bhagavad Gita and left. He utilized Arjuna as a means to deliver it and then left. He delivered it to all of us through Arjuna.\nReferred to as Hrishikesha, He did so in chapter 1 and elsewhere in Bhagavad Gita. Hrishikesha is one who rules senses. God alone can reign over everyone’s senses. God is Numero Uno! There will never be hundreds of Gods. Out of ignorance, some claim that there are many Gods. We must pity them. God is always only one. However, aren’t there many others such as Agni, Indra, Rudra, Varuna, Vayu, etc.? They are all referred to as devatas. Devatas work for God in His system in different authoritative positions. On account of their past pious karmas, few are privileged with these positions and are blessed to do this activity. They are termed as devatas. They are not Gods, they are devatas. God is only one. Some people incorrectly term these devatas as demi-gods. Demi-god is not an appropriate word to describe devatas. They are not eligible to have ‘God’ as part of their name. They have to be termed ‘devata’ irrespective of language. God is the only one who can regulate the entire existence. He is Hrishikesha.\nWhat does He do? He ensures whoever is meant to do whatever task at a respective time, completes it. Thus, He enables the appropriate setting so that we may reform ourselves. If we utilize the given opportunity, we can enhance our state. Otherwise, we will continue to move with the same flow. In chapter 1, He controlled everyone in those times with His power of Hrishikeshatva. He controlled the senses of Kauravas, Pandavas, and others, including animals. They all have life, they all have senses. Don’t they? He has also controlled insects and worms. We notice flies going around us. They have sense organs as well. Therefore, He controlled flies and mosquitoes too! Thus, they were under His spell so as not to interrupt the conversation between Arjuna and Sri Krushna by biting them! He controlled every living entity so that nothing could disturb what needed to be done. Except for Arjuna, whose senses He permitted to operate just enough enabling him to work.\nWhen the war-cry resounded, both the Kaurava and Pandava armies on the battlefield were under His spell. They were under prolonged stupor, a coma-like state. Arjuna wished to see the two armies on the battleground. He wished to see both armies in a single frame. He wanted to see those who were on his side and who he should fight against. Therefore, he commanded Sri Krushna to position the chariot to the center of both armies. This commanding tone came naturally to Arjuna. However, it must not be a command. It must be a request. Why? Because, it is God Himself across from him. Do you command Him or urge Him? Alas! Arjuna didn’t even know that. He commanded that his chariot be positioned in between the two armies. Sri Krushna obeyed. Arjuna was going through gradual transformation of feelings. Firstly, his readiness to commence war had to be gradually altered. Secondly...\ndha:rtha ra:shtrasya durbuddhe:he yuddhe: priya chiki:rshavaha\nverse 23\nDhrutarashtra is evil minded.\nI want to see him and all the other evil-minded people on his side\nLook at the words he used. To that point, he was looking at them as evil-minded people. We must notice the gradual change in Arjuna’s perception later. His perception of them being evil-minded, changes. In the 26th verse, he refers to them as teachers, uncles, nephews, grandfathers, and fathers. Arjuna is now seeing these ‘evil-minded’ ones as his relatives. Thus, we begin to notice transformation in his perception. Actually, it is not wise for a warrior to be thinking this way.\nudaattam is the word used. Need to check the right meaning of it.\nIn fact, Arjuna is a great leader. Can he have such unwanted thoughts? No! Why was this happening? There was a steering in thoughts from within. Firstly, He sounded the conch, reinforcing courage and valor. Immediately, he felt inspired to look at both sides. He felt like passing an order. “Position the chariot between the two armies so I can see them all!” Wherever there is a mention of Hrishikesha, it is accompanied with a change in Arjuna. His behavior transforms. The kinds of words he uses undergo a change. If we can observe the kind of change in him, we can clearly understand the work of Hrishikesha. In Bhagavad Gita...\nTransforming Arjuna’s heart this way... Making him ultimately turn his back on war completely... Making him surrender to God... Making him feel completely in despair... Making him desirous of being Lord’s disciple... Taking him to a state where he felt incompetent unless instructed by Him... Sri Krushna blessed Bhagavad Gita, as if teaching Arjuna, to all those who believe that the world does not run by his/her will and that it runs with the grace of God. It is revealed to guide one how to carry out his responsibilities. We must notice this.\nWhat did Arjuna say? He gave a great order.\nsenayor ubhayor madhye: rattham stthapaya me:chyutha! ||\nposition the chariot in between the two armies\nThe one commanding here is a human being. The one who received the command is the supreme Lord Himself. There is no rule that He must obey the order. It’s fascinating to see the way He gradually transforms Arjuna’s state of mind by first obeying his order exactly as given. This can be observed in the 24th sloka.\nsenayor ubhayor madhye: stthapayithwa: rattho:ththamam ||\nNotice what the order was and how it was followed. The order:\nsenayor ubhayor madhye: rattham stthapaya me:chyutha! ||\nThe way it was obeyed:\nsenayor ubhayor madhye: stthapayithwa: rattho:ththamam ||\nHe executed the order exactly without any discrepancy. When we command taxi drivers with such a tone, it is usually not obeyed. They refute, demanding respect, with a harsher tone, maybe even ready to fight! God, the supreme commander of the entire existence, duly obeyed the orders of one insignificant human being, Arjuna. This reveals how much he loved Arjuna. We must notice this. What is it termed? Bhakta Vatsalya (love towards His devotees). It is also called asrita vatsalya (the love towards those who take shelter of him). We can see the ego of Arjuna and love of God. Lord is an abode of boundless love. Let’s continue to notice this and move ahead.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "episode": 45,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nIn Bhagavad Gita chapter 1, Arjuna refers to Sri Krushna as Achyutha. Achyutha is a fantastic name. In sloka (verse) 21 -\n\nSLOKA WORD - se:nayo:r ubhayo:r madhye: rattham sttha:paya me: achyutha:!\n\nSLOKA MEANING - hey Achyutha, place my chariot between the two armies\nThis was the order Arjuna gave. God tolerates unregulated (off-limits) conduct of His devotees at times due to his amazing quality of vatsalya (parental love). On top of that, He has a great fondness for Arjuna among all Pandavas. He has asrita vyamoha (intense adoration for those who take refuge in Him).\nA great guru, Pillai Lokacharya, established that the prime cause of the Lord’s avatara (incarnation) as Sri Krushna is asrita vyamoha. He explains that sausilya (affability with everyone despite an exalted position), is the prime quality in Sri Rama avatara... and asrita vyamoha, deep adoration for devotees, is the prime quality in Sri Krushna avatara. Vyamoha simply means ‘crazy’ love. We may wonder if it is an appropriate word in this context. Generally, if we like something ordinarily, we name it prema (love). If this love grows, then it is termed verri prema (unbelievable love). If this unbelievable love grows even more, then it becomes moha (passionate desire). Even more, then we name it vyamoha, intense adoration. We must recognize the number of grades that love has evolved, and Sri Krushna has unbelievable, intense adoration for Arjuna.\nHe has vatsalya not actually towards Arjuna, but towards His sister, Draupadi. Because Pandavas tied her mangala sutra (the thread signifying their marriage), Sri Krushna developed vyamoha towards them. That’s why, He went through many ‘difficulties’ for their sake. He drove the chariot. He assumed the role of a messenger to Kauravas. He helped Pandavas in various ways, never questioning what is required. He did all this to keep His word given to Draupadi and to protect her. He wanted to teach a lesson to all those who insulted a woman. This is the essence of Sri Krushna avatara.\nHe is named Achyutha. In general, if we love any person, we tolerate mistakes they make. If we don't like a person, we show anger if they smile, cry or even take a step. Similar to that of a new mother-in-law watching over her new daughter-in-law in olden days. Agama scriptures say when God loves a devotee, He accepts anything he does...\nsirasa: grunha:thi vai svayam\nEven if they ‘throw’ a flower at Him, God likes it, accepts it, and decorates it happily on His head. That’s because of His love for them. He never leaves them alone. Otherwise, He would have abandoned Pandavas long back because of their various arrogant instincts. However, He never does that. It’s not His nature. Therefore, He is called Achyutha.\nTruly, we are all that way too. We act like we have devotion, but when genuinely self-checking, we know that it’s all fake and unnatural. Not anyone in specific, but for a few. Most pray for prasad (Lord’s remnants), and stop once they receive it in their hands. It’s analogous to a beggar who begs only until he receives food. Again, not pointing to anyone among you! You, of course, are all honourable people! God never leaves His devotees, no matter what. Not only that, but He thinks of how to help them using His six divine qualities...\njnana, shakti, bala, aishwarya, virya, tejas\nknowledge, power, strength, wealth, charisma, energy\nHe never lets them fall. He never fails to keep His promise of protecting his devotees. Therefore, He is called Achyutha. People like us always question His existence... “Is God really there? If so, is He simply watching everything?!” Even one of the great devotees, Pothana, once doubted God’s existence and sang...\nkaladu kaladanu vadu kalado ledo\nThe one whom we all believe exists, does He really exist?!\nIn that case, what could have God done? “You question My existence while I am ensuring you are able to breathe as you sleep... I am ensuring your heart continues to beat while you sleep. Let me step away from you.” However, He doesn’t do that. He still stays within us and protects us. Why? Because He is Achyutha! He never breaks the promise of protecting us. He always attempts to benefit us in many ways. He is Achyutha. Because He is Achyutha, He uses Hrishikeshatva (ability to control one’s senses), to stabilize us, so He can further bestow us with upakara (divine benefit). It’s analogous to firmly holding a bolt to be fixed into the wall. Thus, out of vyamoha for protecting us, He first positions us in an appropriate and stable state. Then, He begins to exercise His plan for us. Thus, to use Hrishikeshatva, He must initially use achyuthatva (never letting us go). That is what He did. Therefore, Arjuna ordered Krushna to position his chariot in between the two armies. Lord exercised the order as it is.\n\nSLOKA WORD - e:vam ukthaha hrushi:ke:saha guda:ke:se:na bha:ratha! |\nse:nayo:r ubhayo:r madhye: sttha:payithwa: rattho:ththamam||\n\nSLOKA MEANING - Gudakesha ordered, and Hrishikesha exercised the command.\nThey are both kesha. What a beautiful choice of words! We learned that Hrishikesha is the controller of the senses of all living creatures in this universe. Why is Arjuna called Gudakesha? As per Amarakosam, two actions are referred to as gudakas.\nnidra: a:lasye guda:ka:syath\nsleep and laziness are called gudakas\ngudaka + isa\none who has taken control over sleep and laziness\nSo, Gudakesha is the one who has control over his senses. However, no matter how much one practices gaining control over senses, Hrishikesha puts the gudakesha(s) in His control. We know the greatness of Arjuna from the history given in Bharatam. He didn’t even get tempted by Urvasi, celestial damsel who tried to mesmerize him while he visited heaven. Arjuna is not an ordinary person. That is why Sri Krushna chose him as a means to grace the world with Bhagavad Gita.\ngudakesaha\nGudakesha ordered\nArjuna gave an order to Hrishikesha. Whom did he order?\nhrushikesam\nhe ordered Hrishikesha\nWhat was his order? To place the chariot in between the two armies. What did He do after listening to the order?\nsenayor ubhayor madhye: stthapayithwa: rattho:ththamam\nHe positioned the best chariot, Nanda Gosha, between the armies.\nArjuna was placed between both armies, where he could see everything. Why did he desire this? He needs to be aware of everyone’s true state. We also need to learn about this. We need to be taught about life. God has given us life. He gave the human body as a tool. He gave the surroundings to support the body to survive. He gave the support of other humans. He gave different senses for us to use. So, we need to use all these carefully. Don’t harm each other. Support each other.\nparasparam bha:vayanthah sre:yah param ava:psyatha\nall should live happily supporting each other\nThis is why He bestowed life. Don’t sit idle or misuse it. If everyone lives this way, do we need any rulers, separate mechanisms, police or law or justice system? We wouldn’t need any of that. It seems, in Kruta Yuga, ancient times there was no need to have ‘the ruler and the ruled’ system. People understood the purpose of life and how to carefully use the tools given. There was no need for anyone to do anything for others. As experiences gradually grew, people’s minds weakened, intelligence took a wrong path, and human beings degraded. The more that humans degraded, various levels of protection kits became necessary. PPEs!\nWith the level of degradation, stricter levels of protection, law, and penalty systems came into practice. This was all because human beings became slaves for the experiences around them. Otherwise, none of these would be necessary. Such human beings must be brought back to a grounded state. It is not an easy task. It’s easier to go down than come up. Pushing a big rock onto a mountain requires tremendous effort, but with minor negligence, it rolls back to the bottom of the mountain. It may even crush those who were pushing it. This is a characteristic of our mind. Degradation is very easy, but stepping up for success is highly difficult. God’s quest is to pull all of us from a degraded position to the top position. Therefore, He drove the chariot between both armies and did something wonderful.\nThat is explained in the 25th sloka.\n\nSLOKA WORD - bhi:shma dro:na pramukhathaha sarve:sha:m cha mahi:kshi:tha:m | uva:cha pa:rttha! pasyaitha:n samave:tha:n kuru:n ithi ||\n\nSLOKA MEANING - Positioned between both armies, Sri Krushna looked at Arjuna, who had a clear view of the entire battlefield, and said one word. ‘Pasya’.\nWe must realize that this transformed Arjuna tremendously. What was the change? Let us move ahead and try to find out.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nBhagavad Gita chapter 1 is a beautiful preface for the entire epic. Every word is highly valuable. We should try to understand why, bit by bit.\nGod and Arjuna were seated in a chariot. Arjuna was in the chariot to wage war and Sri Krushna was to steer the chariot. Not only for steering the wheeled-chariot, but also to give the required tools for our chariots, the physical bodies. Arjuna was simply a medium. If we are akin to Arjuna in the chariots called human bodies, He is also sitting along with us in them. Who sees that He is sitting along with us?\npasyanthi jna:na chakshu saha:\ngreat knowledgeable people are able to see Him\nsva:ngushta pramithancha yo:gi hrudaye:shu a:si:na mi:sam\nGod resides in a thumb-sized portion of their hearts, letting them comfortably worship Him\nYogis not only realize His presence within but also see him in everyone’s hearts. In fact, this is a great privilege. We are not ordinary people. If God is within us, it means that this body is a big temple. When God gives us such a great temple, asking us to use it wisely, imagine how best we must utilize it for worthy activities. However, we need to self-examine how well we are utilizing it. The body is a moving temple when God resides in it. Right? We should check for ourselves how valuable it is, how we must use it with care and act responsibly.\nWe should not fill it with unnecessary food, or let out in unregulated ways, utter unwarranted words, or do whatever we like. Because it is a temple! Hence, we must take care of it with respect, love, and care. God resides in everyone like an ant, a mosquito, a lizard, a cat and so on. His presence within humans is understood without explicitly stating it, correct? He resides in everyone, not differentiating based on caste, race, color, occupation, gender, age, and economic status. We feel disgusted when with certain people, but God never feels that way with any of us. That’s because He is the father, and He is the mother, looking after us. God is like a mother who takes her child into her lap, jumps into and saves him from a muddy pond without caring about ruining her silk garments. Hence, He neither feels shy nor disgusted residing within our hearts. He stays in everyone’s hearts. He is here to enhance our situation and instruct us accordingly. We should be simply willing to listen and obey him.\nOne is wrong to think, “I don’t understand. God never gives me direction.” God always motivates and gives an answer in accordance to the current situation. It could be that you have questions or you are in a dilemma, or you can’t decide on a direction to proceed further. If you really trust in Him, God gives His message by some means based on the situation. He may give it from within you or outside. Externally, He may use an omen like animals, trees, birds or the air. Somehow, He conveys His message to you. However, our ignorance, ego, fraudulent character or pride blocks us from receiving His messages. If we can calmly establish a heartfelt connection with him, we can listen to His words very clearly. We must have the desire to listen. If we listen, then we have everything.\nChapter 1 verse 25 conveys the same. Arjuna ordered Sri Krushna to position the chariot between two armies and Lord did exactly that. Being the supreme controller of the universe, He chose to be a charioteer. He was neither shy nor hesitant to do it because He was doing it for His son [Arjuna]. Telugu people are timid, or it could be a self-esteem issue. They worry if others notice them while doing their own work. They feel low about cleaning and beautifying their own front yard, doing laundry, washing utensils, painting the house, doing garden work, etc. For every activity, they are shy, with a low self-esteem, and worry about what others may perceive. They want things to be beautiful but won’t take initiative to do their own work. They are highly bashful. God is never that way. We are even shy to fold our hands while praying to God in a temple, wondering what people may think. We may have seen people at temples debating whether they should fold their hands or not. They want to pray but are not sure what others would think and get into a confused state. We see people in temples seeking forgiveness indicated by a gesture of patting their cheeks. However, they don’t want to do it if someone is watching them. Insecurity stops them from doing it openly, but they want to do it. So, they search for a spot in the temple to do so secretly. Why lead life that way?\nGod is never shy or hesitant. Be free! He feels, “You are my devotee and you asked me to drive the chariot. I will do as you say and won’t care who is watching.”\nbhi:shma dro:na pramukhathaha: pasyatham\nsarve:shamcha mahi:kshitha:m pasyatha:m\nbhi:shma dro:na pramuk:athaha:\ntake the chariot in front of the great people, Bhishma and Drona\nThey are both devotees, hence they understand the quality of the Lord to be accessible to His devotees. However,\nsarve:shamcha mahi:kshitha:m\nthere are many other kings\nIs it okay for all of them to watch Him?\nsarve:shamcha mahi:kshitha:m pasyatha:m\nlet anyone and everyone watch\nGod does not mind who is watching or what one may think when He is serving His beloved ones. This is how He drove the chariot. This is how He served them. This is how He protected Pandavas’ lives. Mahabharata says,\nkrushna pra:na:scha pa:ndava:ha:\nkrushna na:dha:scha pa:ndava:ha:\nWhat did He do after bringing the chariot to the midst of the battlefield?\nuva:cha\nspoke\nWe do not notice that Krushna spoke in the first chapter. Why? We see Dhrutarashtra uva:cha, Sanjaya uva:cha, Arjuna uva:cha. Suyodhana and Sri Krushna also spoke, but we don’t see ‘uva:cha’ for their words in the first chapter. From the 2nd chapter onwards, we see Sri Bhagavan uvacha. However, He also spoke a few words in the first chapter. In sloka 25, it says uva:cha. What did He say?\npa:rdha pasye:tha:n samave:tha:n kuru:n\nlook at all the people who gathered here\nithi uva:cha\nHe said so\nSri Krushna asked Arjuna to look at the people gathered there. This is the catch here! Why would He ask him to ‘look’ when there is nothing to look at? Arjuna wanted to see everyone and thus asked Sri Krushna to move the chariot accordingly. What would Arjuna do anyway other than looking at those assembled, when the purpose of asking Krushna to move the chariot in the midst of the armies was just that? This is similar to the first question from Dhrutarashtra.\nyuyuthsavaha samave:tha:ha kima kurvatha:\nWhat did they do after coming to wage the war?\nIsn’t that a silly question? If they have come to fight the war, one must ask how the fight was going rather than what they were doing. We discussed the reason for this previously. Similarly, Arjuna intended to ‘see’ people on his side and on the opposition side.\naham pasye:yam\nEven then, Sri Krishna specifically says to ‘see’ everyone gathered there, why? Because what He instructed him to see is different from what Arjuna intended to see. Arjuna should not see his own intended scene. Instead he should see what Sri Krushna wishes to show him or what he could not see, then Sri Krushna’s instruction, ‘see’, will be justified. Sri Krushna asked him to look at the ones assembled here from the Kaurava dynasty.\npasya\nsee\nArjuna looked at them.\nthatra:pasyath sthitha:n pa:rdha pithru: nadha pitha:maha:n\nThe perspective has changed now. Earlier he saw them to be relatives of Dhrutarashtra, the one with bad intentions.\ndha:tra ra:shtrasya durbhudhe:he:\nIf they are the relatives of Dhrutarashtra, why would he see them as his relatives? After Sri Krushna asked him to see, Arjuna saw it differently. A coin has two sides, head and tails. We must see both sides and act accordingly. Similarly, people gathered on the opposite side have two faces. One state is that they are related to Dhrutarashtra and the second state is that they are his relatives. Arjuna’s readiness for war, his valor, and egocentric attitude allowed him to see only their animosity. However, when Sri Krushna asked him to ‘see’, the coin flipped.\nWhat did he see?\npithru:n adha pitha:maha:n pa:rtha ha: apasyathi\nNow he sees them as -\npithru:n - fathers\npitha:maha:n - grandfathers\na:charya:n - gurus\nma:thula:n - uncles\nbhra:thru:n - brothers\nputhra:n - son like\npouthr:an - grandson like\nsvisura:n - maternal uncles\nsuhrudahan - well-wishers\nTo whom? Where are they?\nsenayo: rubayo: rapi\nboth sides have well-wishers\nBhishma and Drona, although on the Kauravas’ side, are his well-wishers. Both sides have good and bad natured people. However, the ones perceived to be bad people earlier are not seen this way anymore. The scene has changed. He sees relations, they are now all perceived as relatives. What a surprise is this?! This is the effect of ‘pasya’, the order given by Sri Krushna, Achyutha, Hrishikesha. Let’s move ahead to understand in detail.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nGod never offers superfluous or worthless messages. Even if only a single word or a few words, they are always purposeful. We need to understand this. The first chapter of Bhagavad Gita makes this very clear. The instruction given by God, in the midst of the battlefield, was a very simple word. What was that?\npa:rtha! pasya etha:n samave:tha:n kuru:n\nArjuna! Look at the Kuru warriors assembled here.\nThat is the order God gave to Arjuna. When Arjuna followed that order, he started seeing all of them as relatives instead of as enemies. That is the impact of God’s word.\nWe notice this in many instances. Once earlier, Pandavas experienced an incident in the forest. While in exile, Duryodhana wanted to somehow humiliate them. He wanted to see Pandavas face hardships and the wrath of Rishis. Dhrutarashtra, Duryodhana, and his friends have these malicious intentions. Thus, Arjuna refers to them as “Dha:rthara:shtrasya durbuddhe:he:” Earlier in sloka 23.\nThey always had bad intentions. Hence, Duryodhana and his friends once invited a sage who was very dear to them. That sage’s name was Durvasa. They sent him along with his 10,000 disciples to the forest. “Respected Sage! Pandavas are doing immense tadiyaradhana—respecting elders and devotees by feeding them to satisfaction. You should also grace them.” “They will offer their respects to you and benefit from your grace.” With ill-intent, they also suggested the sage to visit Pandavas along with his disciples at a specific time, in the noon.\nPandavas previously possessed a vessel named ‘Akshaya Patra’. This vessel was given to them by the Sun Devata (celestial being) before their forest exile. Using that vessel, Pandavas could feed any number of people to satisfaction. Akshaya Patra keeps providing food as requested. However, once Draupadi takes food, it does not give any additional food for that part of the day. That was the rule for Akshaya Patra. Wherever they went, Pandavas used to do tadiyaradhana every day with the vessel.\nOne day, they similarly completed this tadiyaradhana activity. Everyone was well fed. Draupadi ensured that everybody partook of the prasada (a sanctified meal offered to God). She had her own meal, washed the Akshaya Patra and put it away. Duryodhana planned that Sage Durvasa would arrive immediately after all this. Dharmaraja welcomed the sage, “Respected Sage! You arrived at ‘madhyahnikam’, at midday.” “It is my responsibility to host all of you.” “There is a river nearby. Kindly have a holy bath there and return. We will keep prasada ready by then.” The sage went to the river along with his disciples. Dharmaraja then informed Draupadi about preparing prasada. However, she had also taken prasada for the day. There was nothing left. She said, “Oh no! It’s all finished for the day.” Dharmaraja replied, “Alas! I have already assured the sage of hosting him and his disciples.” She said, “Really?! Without consulting me?!” He said, “The sage had already arrived. How could I refrain from showing hospitality?” She retorted, “Well, now you know! Always consult the lady of the house!”\nThe damage was already done. Sage had already proceeded to the riverside. To make matters worse, the sage who came was Durvasa himself. He is known to be very short-tempered. At the slightest indignation, he was ready to give great curses to his offenders. He had doled out curses many times, but still had not learned to conquer his anger. “Anyway, today he is here. What do we do now?” Dharmaraja was in a fix.\nIt is always the woman who saves the home from calamities. Draupadi took charge of the situation, went inside and prayed to Sri Krishna. “Whenever I am in trouble, You are the one who saves me.” “In my childhood, Sage Vasishta told me.” We must all remember this.\n\nSLOKA WORD - mahathya:padi sampra:pthe: smarthavyo: bhagava:n Harihi SLOKA MEANING - whenever we face any troublesome situation, we must pray to Sri Hari alone for help\nIf we pray to any others here and there, the situation will not be addressed. It will only worsen. The case of Coronavirus is a live example for us. Somebody mentioned an example from either Skanda Purana or Devi Bhagavatha. Even in them, it is mentioned that we must pray only to Vishnu. Because Sri Hari is the only one who can protect us at any time, from any misfortune or calamity.\nmahathya:padi sampra:pthe\neven if the calamity is of huge magnitude, only Sri Hari can protect us\nSage Vasishta said this to Draupadi. That is the reason she prayed to Sri Hari when she was humiliated and troubled in the King’s assembly. She always experienced His protection whenever she prayed to him. Thus, she now prayed to Sri Krishna again.\nHe Listened to her prayers and personally arrived. Lord said, “Dear Sister, I am starving now. Can you first feed me something?” “I prayed to you to help me with this issue. I am struggling to find a way to feed the sage and his disciples... You are now asking me to feed you!” she exclaimed. “We will discuss that later, sister. But now, I am starving. Please give me some food.”, Lord said. “You are making fun of my situation, Lord. There is nothing left for the day. I have also taken prasada. In addition, I washed the Akshaya Patra clean.” He said, “I am famished now, sister.” She said, “I washed the vessel too, my brother!” He said, “Just bring that vessel to me. Let’s see. There might at least be some leaves left over.” She said, “No brother. I washed the vessel and kept it inside.” She used to take pride in her dish-washing skills. Fortunately she was not accompanied by her mother-in-law during exile. If her mother-in-law saw the state of the dish after cleaning, she would have taught her a lesson. As she was not present, however Draupadi washed the dish, there was nobody to question. “Brother! I washed the vessel and kept it inside,” Draupadi insisted. “Just bring it to me, sister. See inside if there is anything left over. Just see.” He said, ‘Pasya’. “See”.\nSimply because the Lord said ‘pasya’, she went inside to fetch the vessel, there was indeed a little leaf stuck inside. Lord looked and said, “Wow. Something is indeed there.” He took that leaf and ate it. “Let all the three worlds be satiated”, Lord said. Just as He expressed His will, the sage and his 10,000 disciples who were finishing prayers after the ritualistic river bath, also felt overgorged as they are indeed part of these three worlds. They were supposed to come back to Pandavas' abode to take prasadam. However, they felt overly full, like after eating abdikapubhojanam (lunch offered during annual death ceremonies). At such times, they put a wet cloth over themselves and keep fanning themselves to address the uneasiness of being overstuffed. This sage and all his disciples were in the same stage. They were unable to move.\nMeanwhile, Draupadi was looking at her brother expectantly. He said, “Sister! Now you can return to your other tasks.” She was about to ask, “Then what about...” He said, “Don’t worry about that. Take this vessel back and keep it inside.” Lord came out and spoke to Dharmaraja, “Fetch the sage and his disciples. Tell them that the food is all prepared and ready to be served.” “Brother-in-law, where is the food?” asked Dharmaraja. “You don’t worry about that. Just convey the message” said Sri Krishna. The sage and his disciples were not to be seen anywhere nearby. Dharmaraja called out to Bhima, “Bhima! It looks like they are not coming anytime soon.” “You are capable of fetching all of them, even if they are incapable of walking. Please go get them.” As the sage and disciples watched Bhima approaching, they understood that he would take them by force if needed to feed them. They thought, “Here he comes! No place for even a morsel of food. How do we now refuse?!” They wanted to escape before Bhima reached them. So, they started running away from him, rushing and rolling. They did not understand what had happened. It happened because Sri Krishna said, “pasya.” He simply said “see.” The scene there changed as per His wish. That is His capability, “Hrishikeshatva”, ability to control the senses of all beings.\nThe same goes for the battlefield as well. He simply told Arjuna to ‘see’.\npasya etha:n samave:tha:n kuru:n\nsee the Kauravas assembled here\nSee the descendants of Kuru dynasty. Arjuna then saw with his eyes open. He saw something that was not visible to him until then. God has a name, ‘Kavi’. Upanishad says,\nkavirmani:shi: paribhu: swayambhu:hu\nGod can see everything that we can’t. In addition, He can show us as well. So far, Arjuna was only seeing enemies in the opposite camp. In life, we are not only surrounded by enemies but also by friends. We should know how to behave with friends as well. Similarly, we should know how to behave with enemies. You should know your limits and know how to behave with friends and enemies. Bhagavad Gita manifested to teach this. That is why Lord told Arjuna to ‘see’, to show the second relation Arjuna had with the people assembled there.\nIn this chapter, ‘Hrishikeshatva’, was first used when He sounded the divine conch filling enthusiasm in Pandavas and despair in Kauravas. Second, ‘Hrishikeshatvam’ was used when He inspired Arjuna to think of asking Lord to move his chariot to the center of the battlefield. Third, when He provoked Arjuna to be vocal and make him ask the Lord. Fourth, now evoking Arjuna to ‘see’. It gradually brings out a change in each of Arjuna’s senses.\nArjuna saw as soon as he was ordered by Lord to ‘see’.\nthathra:pasyath sthitha:n pa:rtha…\n…se:nayo:rubhayo:rapi\nthose in both armies\nAs soon as Arjuna saw the people of both the armies, what did he feel?\n\nSLOKA WORD - tha:n sami:kshya sa kaunthe:yaha, sarva:n bandhu:n avasthitha:n krupaya: paraya:vishtaha, vishi:dam idam abravi:th SLOKA MEANING - He felt deep grief.\nHe felt deep grief. We discussed the sorrow felt by Dhrutarashtra earlier. We also discussed Duryodhana’s sorrow. Now, Arjuna also felt sorrow. Arjuna had arrived at the battlefield full of valor and bravery. Lord gradually transformed it into grief. What did Arjuna see, to grieve? Whom did he see? The sloka does not say ‘sarva:n sathru:n avasthitha:n’. It says ‘sarva:n bandhu:n avasthitha:n’. Arjuna started seeing only relatives. Facing an enemy, he will certainly fight. How can he fight against his own kin? This is a great combination of words. We should remember them carefully.\nsathruvu, enemy / bandhuvu, relative\nIf he sees the opponent as an enemy, he will not hesitate to create the worst form of terrorism, forms of Jihad. Whereas, if he sees the other person as a relative, he will respect that person, no matter what. Our Vedic literature enlightens us about the relationship we have with the rest of the mankind. Many others teach only about enmity. Bhagavad Gita, which is the essence of our Vedic literature, teaches about the relationship across all species. That is the reason we need Bhagavad Gita. It is also the reason why we should be able to share this knowledge about Gita with everyone. If other cultures also can receive this, then those with extremist nature will mend. This is also wonderfully conveyed by Swami Ramanujacharya.\nkrupaya: paraya:vishtaha…\nhe was overwhelmed with ‘krupa’ (mercy)\n…vishi:dan\nfilled with grief\n…idam abravi:th\nstarted talking to Lord Krishna\nLet’s carefully listen to what he said to Sri Krishna.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Sri:manna:ra:yana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhus,\nArjuna has another name, Kapidhvaja. Why? Hanuma:n had given a boon to Pa:ndava:s. During their forest exile, Draupadi once yearned for a Saugandhika flower, a rare species. Bhi:ma embarked on a journey to search for it in the Himalayas. On the way, he saw a monkey’s tail blocking his way. He could not move it. “Why is this so heavy and difficult to lift?!” Upon praying, he realized this was no ordinary monkey, but the great hero among monkeys, A:njane:ya himself.\nA:njane:ya gave Bhi:ma two boons. Firstly, whenever Bhi:ma is on a battlefield and gives out a war-cry, A:njane:ya would add to it in synchrony with Bhi:ma’s voice. Secondly, A:njane:ya would always stand guard on Arjuna’s chariot to protect him, their prime warrior. Since then, Arjuna had the symbol of Hanuma:n on his chariot’s flag. Thus, he became ‘kapi-dhwaja.’\nArjuna desired to see the warriors of both the armies. He ordered Sri Krishna to place the chariot in the midst of the battlefield. Parama:thma, the supreme soul, who is accessible with incessant love for his devotees, drove the chariot to the middle of both armies. He showed Arjuna the two armies as if stating, “See! This is what you wish to see.” Upon seeing what He showed, Arjuna’s state of mind changed completely. Until this point, he saw enemies. After Sri Krishna told him to ‘see’, he did not recognize enemies. He only ‘saw’ his relations with everyone there.\nNot just one, he saw all kind of relationss… a:cha:rya:ha, teachers, pitharaha, father figures, puthra:ha, sons, pouthra:ha, grand-sons, sambandhinaha, relatives, sya:la:ha, brothers-in-law. “Oh my God! How can I kill them all?”. His original thought process seems to be changing.\nBhagavad Gi:tha chapter 1 slo:ka 27 describes this. “Look,” said Sri Krishna. Arjuna saw. What did he see? He saw relatives.\n\nSLOKA WORD - tha:n sami:kshya sa Kaunthe:yaha, sarva:n bandhu:n avasthitha:n\nSLOKA MEANING - He looked at all the relatives assembled there.\nsam… i:kshya observed keenly. He could not find anyone who was not related to him. In fact, we are related to everyone in this world. How? Relatives are those who have descended from the same source, right? Who is our source of existence? We came from our mother’s womb. However, we got into the mother’s womb through mother earth. We have come from pancha bhu:thas, five elements. All other living beings are also made of these same five elements. Thus, the source for every being is the same. That's how we are all related.\nWhat kind of feelings should we have towards them? Respect, compassion and love. If so, how would we interact with them? We need to ensure they are doing well in their respective places. Some may think, “I have love for him. However, why should I bother correcting his mistakes as long as our relationship is intact?” They are not true relatives. If someone really cares for the person, one must correct that person for his best interest. Only then, he is a true relative.\nArjuna saw relatives all around - sarva:n bandhu:n avasthitha:n sami:kshya. Immediately, he was overtaken by mercy. That feeling is termed ‘krupa:’.\n\nSLOKA WORD - krupaya: paraya:vishtaha SLOKA MEANING - he was overwhelmed by krupa, as if out of thin air\nSanjaya says, a:vishtaha. This is a beautiful usage of the word. What does it mean? It is a state of person: forgetting one’s own nature and form completely, totally subservient to the element that took him/her captive. Right now, Arjuna was held captive by the feeling of ‘krupa’. We would have also seen in villages occasionally, a:ve:sam, people being possessed. It could be that one is possessed by divine forces or of other kinds. It is a sort of emotion, intoxication, a state of frenzy. The person who is so overtaken by emotion is termed ‘a:vishta’.\nNow Arjuna is krupaya: paraya: a:vishtaha. He is held captive by limitless krupa. paraya: a:vishtaha.\nOccasionally in villages, we see possessed people in temples or other congregations. The divine forces hold them captive. Such people forget themselves completely. They become unaware of their limitations, lack of knowledge. They talk just like one who is highly knowledgeable. They fully lose their nature. They simply take up the nature of the other being because they are possessed by that being. They speak just like the one who is holding them captive. “I am such a person, de:vatha, celestial being, etc.” We notice this type of behavior during congregations. For some people, this happens when they go to a temple or some sacred place. Let us not delve deep into what this possession means. When a person has an immense feeling of krupa and has become ‘a:vishta’, held captive, how does he behave? We took this example to help understand the situation of such a person. When a person is possessed, he disregards all his limitations and becomes capable of things that he could not do earlier. Even if he was handicapped earlier, he runs. Even a very weak and meek person will be able to fend off many people at once, just like a hero in Telugu movies. That is the state of a possessed person. He loses himself. Whatever the one who has possessed him says, he submits to it fully. He behaves in accordance with that. We cannot comprehend the power of a possessed person.\nArjuna is not possessed by any external forces. He is held captive by the feeling of krupa - krupaya: paraya: a:vishtaha. Not just little krupa. Tremendous amounts of it. What are the symptoms of krupa? What does it mean?\n‘Krupa’ is a bhava-prakarsha, an intense emotion, which makes us do three things. The person becomes incapable of tolerating any kind of suffering of other beings - human, animal or bird. Not just inability to accept the suffering of others, he wants to somehow alleviate others’ pain. This is nicely expressed in Sanskrit, ‘para dukkha nira:chiki:rsha’. Unable to watch others’ suffering, developing into an intense urge to take it away. ‘Para dukkha nira:chiki:rsha’. It does not stop there. Unless a person undergoes ‘para dukkha asahishnutha’, one cannot experience ‘para dukkha nira:chiki:rsha’. The person is firstly in a state where he is unable to see the other suffering. Once he realizes he is unable to see the suffering, he wants to alleviate that sorrow.\nWhy? para dukkha dukkhitwam when seeing another suffering, he undergoes the same pain. Nobody wants to feel pain. One wants to be sorrow-free. Whatever is the reason for his sorrow, if that can be addressed, then he can be pain-free. The reason for his pain is the suffering of others. So, until the other’s suffering is addressed fully, he will continue to suffer. That’s because others’ suffering is the cause of his pain.\nThus, there are three activities happening here. Firstly, on seeing the suffering of others, he himself experiences sadness. This is called ‘para dukkha dukkhitwam’. Nobody wants to be sad, ever. We do activities causing pain, but certainly nobody wants to experience this pain. We all belong to the tribe of Duryo:dhana. He says, “ja:na:mi dharmam…” He says, “I know what is right but I won’t do it and I know what is wrong but I won’t stop doing that.” If another person's pain has to subside, he must first address his own grief. To address his grief, he tries to address the cause of another’s pain. He feels pain because another being is suffering. To address this cause of his pain, he ensures that the other being’s suffering is addressed.\n\nSLOKA WORD - para dukkha dukkhitwam SLOKA MEANING - grieving on seeing someone’s pain\n\nSLOKA WORD - para dukkha asahishnutha SLOKA MEANING - unable to tolerate others’ pain as that is causing pain for himself\n\nSLOKA WORD - para dukkha nira:chiki:rsha SLOKA MEANING - wishing to address other’s pain as a means to his own pain-free state\nThus, scriptures define ‘krupa’ as the nature of a person whose sole means of happiness is to do what it takes to address others’ grief. Arjuna is full of ‘krupa’ now. Slo:ka 27 says that Arjuna grieved tremendously being a:vishta, possessed, with this feeling. What did this grief do to Arjuna? That is important to know. Let’s learn about this.\nJai Sri:manna:rayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "chapter": 1,
    "episode": 49,
    "content": "Jai Sri:manna:ra:yana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhu:la:ra,\nChapter 1 in Bhagavad Gi:tha is named ‘Arjuna Visha:da Yo:ga’. Arjuna’s grief became a means for conveying God’s upade:sa not only to Arjuna, but also to mankind in general. ‘Yo:ga’ refers to a means. That is why the chapter is named ‘Arjuna Visha:da Yo:ga’. What does ‘visha:dam’ mean? It requires one to go through 3 phases or 3 activities from within. In general, ‘visha:dam’ means grief or sadness. Arjuna experienced this visha:dam. Grief or deep sorrow does not emerge instantly.\nWhat happens when one experiences it? When do we call it ‘visha:dam’? Firstly, the manas (heart) which has been rock-solid, develops some sort of cracks and gets to a stage where it crumbles. It was hard and stubborn to date, and now begins to soften and becomes compliant. This is the first phenomenon that occurs. This hrudayam, heart, does not resemble the physical organ. It is a divine, marvelous object. It melts and flows. People say, “His heart melted.” “Looking at that pitiful situation, my heart melted.” Once liquified, does the heart solidify again? Will the fellow exist if the heart melts fully? The act of ‘melting’ mentioned here is different. It’s not like an ice cube or solid ghee melting with heat. The ‘melting of the heart’ is different.\nArjuna’s heart now must thaw. It was initially hard. “I am a brave person, a warrior, capable of conquering enemies, I will fight in the war, killing all these people.” Such was his nature. However now, he says “I should not wage war as it means killing all of them, who are my relatives. How absurd to kill one’s own relatives!” “Any war is waged for benefit, to enjoy the fruits of victory. One can enjoy only when shared with all his people.” “If I kill such relatives, what is the point of war? Where is the enjoyment?”\nThere was a shift in his thought process. We discovered the reason for Arjuna’s shift in our earlier sessions. Why is his thought process changing? This is being stage-managed by God, ‘Hrushi:ke:saha’. He is controlling all the senses of everybody around, letting only appropriate sense organs operate. He is ‘Hrushi:ke:sa’. He is the reason for these changes. A raw, sour fruit ripens gradually and becomes sweet, tasty, and a source of enjoyment for the taste buds. Similarly, the heart which was hardened in earthly matters, needed to be softened to be eligible for divine knowledge. If ghee solidifies due to low temperatures, it can be liquified by heating. Similarly, to melt the heart, it needs some tha:pam, heat. We will discuss this tha:pam later. When the heart undergoes this tha:pam, it starts to gradually melt. However, it does not melt all of a sudden. It happens systematically. In the first stage, the person sees the relationship with other people, and grieves when knowing it will be lost. This is tha:pam.\nTha:pam is essential for something to melt. What is tha:pam? “I am about to lose something which is close to my heart. I am going to be flooded with something which I don’t like. Due to this, my happiness will be lost.” “I am about to lose something I like and I am being left with something I hate.” What do we want, in general? We want abundance of what we like and to be far from things that we don’t like. However, Sri Krushna is explaining what is actually happening within. Losing something we desire or having to deal with the undesired. Getting rid of undesired and having something that is desired. In both the above conditions, the heart experiences some movement. We experience ‘melting’ mentally. One type of ‘melting’ is termed uddharsha, happiness. The opposite type of ‘melting’ is termed anuddharsha, sadness, or grief. We term these emotions as pongu, happiness and kongu, sorrow. Both these emotions gradually melt toughness in the heart. This process is called ‘visaranam’ in Sanskrit. The entity which was initially firm, gradually develops cracks and starts to crumble. This is called ‘visaranam’.\nWhat happens due to that gradual melting? Gathi, a drift or movement, begins. A nice, large ice-cube begins melting when kept out on a sunny day. Until then, it was solid. We notice that it gradually melts and drains out. That means, it starts flowing. Similarly, the heart too should start to gradually melt from the firm and solid state. This is called visarana. After melting, it should start flowing gradually. This stage is called gathi. This flow should culminate at some place. Where should it head to? Whatever object the person desires, this flow should culminate there. Or, whatever he abhors, it should reach there. It might sound odd, “Why should it flow towards the undesired object?” If the destination is a desired one, it gives happiness by bringing the person closer to it. If it is an undesired one, it causes sorrow or fear by bringing the person closer to it.\nThis destination is not a physical location. It is a destination in the bha:vana, feeling. Once that destination is reached, the person might experience fear. For example, a fear that a snake will bite and harm him. Once that fear sets in, he starts running away. Just by thinking, just as he visualizes… “I went to a place that I like a lot; I saw something pleasant; they offered me something nice; I ate that and experienced a lot of happiness” – this too is just a feeling. However, it creates a situation in the mind - he visualizes it to be an experience in the physical plane impacting him either favorably or unfavorably. He will experience all the related emotions. If that is favorable, it could be something like enjoying a fruit that he most desires. If unpleasant, it could be a snake which instills fear in him, or a thief, or some other animal attacking him. He feels these. In reality, it is just a feeling. However, the feeling is so deep that the experience feels real. At times, it is just superficial. At other times, the feeling is more intense. If it is a deeper experience, he will act as if the situation is transpiring physically in front of him. He talks in that fashion, eats, acts, hits, falls, and does many such activities.\n\nSLOKA WORD - prathyaksha sama:na anubhavam SLOKA MEANING - a feeling that resembles real experience\nThis happens in both scenarios, happiness and sorrow. The stage just before such an experience is called tha:pam. Tha:pam is of three types. The first type is caused by the surrounding living objects. This is termed a:dhi bhauthika tha:pam. The second type is caused by environmental factors like the sun, rain, wind, cold, and heat. These are de:vathas, divine energies, and thus this tha:pam is termed a:dhi daivika tha:pam. The third type is caused by the manas. The term ‘a:thma’ has several meanings - manas, ji:va, God. The tha:pam caused from within is called a:dhi a:thmika tha:pam. First is a:dhi bhauthikam. Second is a:dhi daivikam. At times, there is nothing externally. A person on his own develops these feelings. “That fellow has earned a lot. Look at me! What a contrast!” This feeling is not imposed by anyone externally. He himself created it. This sorrow is simply a result of an ill feeling developed in the heart. Sometimes he sees a big house, “Wow! He built such a huge home for himself. Look at me! I am languishing in a small hut.” This person is in fact living within his means. The other fellow is living as per his status. This person does not know the difficulties that the other person faced to reach such a status in life. However, he simply sees the palatial house he built, and experiences a sour feeling. In reality, this is simply an internal thought and feeling. This is done with manas, mind. Manas is also called ‘a:thma’. There are many sorrows caused by manas.\nSuch sorrows are called a:dhi a:thmika. The ones caused by manas are called a:dhyathmika tha:pa:s. If the pains were a result of environmental factors, we call them a:dhi daivika tha:pas. If the discomforts were caused by living beings around us – be it humans, animals, birds, small ants, viruses, mosquitoes - we call them a:dhi bhauthika tha:pa:s. All these are pains, sorrows – tha:pas. When the heart starts melting under the influence of these tha:pa:s, then the ‘gathi’ stage begins. In the ghee example, it gradually melts, becomes less dense and starts flowing if spilled, traveling to whichever destination possible. Similarly, the heart goes through three stages - visarana, gathi and avasa:dam. Then it culminates at some destination. The root cause which leads to such an experience of these three stages is called visha:dam. It is in fact a sad state. Dhruthara:shtra also experienced this state of mind. Duryo:dhana experienced it as well. Arjuna also experiences the same state. We too experience this at times. Why to say ‘at times’? We can say ‘frequently’! We are happy only once in a while but we experience this sad state almost always. Arjuna also experienced it. We must know what he did when he experienced ‘visha:dam’. We should also think about what we are supposed to do in such situations. Let us do so gradually as we continue forward.\nJai Sri:manna:rayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "In our Bharathiya (Indian) way of life, we do not confine perception only to physical appearance. All objects are created in conjunction with nature. Vedas reveal how these objects are created. Every object is given a form and name, with a soul entering that object. Along with the soul, God also enters the object. With Godʼs support, the soul bears the object. This is a marvelous process. Aside from Bharathiya culture, which places faith in Vedas, no other culture has this depth of insight. This is known as tathvika-drishti (philosophical view). The objectʼs outer layer is created by combining five principal elements - earth, water, fire, air, and space. Within the object, there is a sentient entity backed by the supreme consciousness. These are the three layers. The first, or outermost layer, is bhauthikam (physical). Knowledge of bhauthikam is termed ‘adhi-bhauthika-jnanam'. Proper insight into this knowledge is called ‘adhi-bhauthika-drishti'. Understanding the 2nd layer of atma-tathvam (a sentient entity). insight into this layer is known as ‘adhi-daivika-drishti'. When extended to the supreme consciousness in the 3rd and innermost layer, ‘adhi-atmika-drishti' is developed. It is known as ‘adhyatmika'. Our rushis (sages), have taught us these three knowledge levels - ‘adhi-bhauthika', ‘adhi-daivika', and ‘adhi-atmika'. Realizing this, undertaking any new task, our elders offered prayers to the tools utilized for that occupation. At a minimum, they offer gratitude and meditate upon these 3 levels. A farmer entering a field would offer prayers to his tools of trade, including the land, plough, and animals. Similarly, a weaver would offer prayers to God [within weaving materials] before beginning work. Likewise, a potter works with this insight when he is making the pots. This kind of 3-fold insightfulness is needed for everyone, regardless of profession.\nSimilarly, when studying Bhagavad Gita, we do not view it as simply another book. The first physical scriptural layer is the manifestation of nature. The 2nd layer, ‘jiva-tathvam', infuses the scripture with its essential characteristics via conscious energy. ‘Bhagavad-tathvam' (supreme consciousness), is the 3rd layer supporting the first two. To experience anything, these three layers must connect to form that object. As long as we perceive objects in this manner, God carefully preserves us. When this changes, God enacts the required transitions. Traditionally, our elders offer prayers to the text form of Bhagavad Gita at the outset. They donʼt view the scripture simply as a book, but rather, as a form of God. They passed on a beautiful prayer re-enforcing this mood. To whom are we praying? To Lord Himself. What is Lordʼs form? His forms are unlimited! He has as many forms as there are letters… …as many forms as there are musical intonations… …his forms are limitless. He is Anantha (unlimited). He is known as Anantha because… …itʼs not possible to count His virtues or describe His exquisite forms and also in His countless incarnations. We discussed avatharas (incarnations) previously. Each aim at a specific objective. When He incarnated as Sri Krishna, He chose to be in the form of His teachings. These teachings are found in scriptural form, Bhagavad Gita. He resides within Bhagavad Gita text, accepting it as His physical body, remaining directly perceptible for us. Hence, scripture is not simply a collection of pages. Our acharyas (gurus) begin studying any text by offering prayers to the philosophy covered by that specific scripture. Since scripture is the instrument conveying knowledge, they offer prayers to the scripture as well. Only then, they pursue their quest for knowledge.\nUsually, a shelf with scriptures is kept beside puja mandirs (where one worships deities at home). This shelf would include texts including Ramayana, Bharatham, Bhagavatam, Puranas, or other scriptures containing divine knowledge. While making offerings to Lord, offerings are made to scriptures as well. They experience divinity within scripture. The shelf and its scriptures are treated as divine. An often heard prayer, while offering mangalasanams (blessings for prosperity), to lord…\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = sriyah ka:ntha:ya kalya:na nidhaye: nidhaye:rthina:m | sri: ve:nkata niva:sa:ya sri:niva:sa:ya mangalam ||\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = prayers wishing prosperity to Lord - Sri Ranganatha, Varadaraja, Melkote-Narayana…\n\n…wishing prosperity to alwars and acharyas, as through them, we perceive divine knowledge. Finally, we offer mangalasanams to scriptures with a special sloka (verse).\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = mangala:sa:sana paraihi mada:cha:rya puro:gamaihi sarvais cha pu:rvaihi a:cha:ryaihi sathkrutha:ya … mangalam\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = that which is respected\n\nWhat did all these great people respect? They respected that which illuminates internal knowledge. Scriptures reveal knowledge through their teachings. Indeed, upadesas (divine messages), reveal this knowledge. However, qualified gurus must bless us with these upadesas. With scriptures, there are no such troubles. With some effort, we can always find appropriate scriptures. Hence, texts are crucial. Our previous scholars established scriptures as the manifested forms of these tathvas (philosophical truths). Thus, they would offer prayers wishing auspiciousness to scriptures, alongwith Lord.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = mangala:sa:sana paraihi mada:cha:rya puro:gamaihi | sarvais cha pu:rvair a:cha:ryaihi sathkrutha:ya:stu mangalam ||\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = praying to scriptures that are respected by the lineage of acharyas\n\nIt is said, Lord appears in various forms - mobile and immobile. Along with these, He manifests in another form - scriptural form. This is why our elders pray to scriptures as well. Scriptures also have jiva-tathvam and bhagavad-tathvam. That majestic bhagavad-tathvam (supreme consciousness), which we want to experience, is directly present in the objects we see. In reality, our point of view simply needs to transform. No matter how much external change, without developing deep faith, we will not recognize God even when He stands directly before us! “Ah, nice costume! Move along!” We would think of him as an imposter. Lord can be seen within inanimate objects as well, when strong faith is developed. Thus, our elders pray, “Oh Lord, stay with me in scriptural form.”\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = mama hrudhi sannidhim a:thano:thu sourihi\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = shower Your blessings and compassion onto us in scriptural form\n\nNot by standing before us, rather in scriptural form! Without this, we can read, but those eternal truths will not glow internally. To emphasize the importance of praying to scriptures, our acharyas have given us beautiful sloka (verse). Let Lord reside as this Gita scripture within me.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = mama hrudhi sannidhim a:thano:thu sourihi\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = making my heart His abode, via scripture, may He synthesize knowledge within me\n\nLet us always perceive Him. May his blessings always be upon us. We start by wishing mangalasanams to Lord, then to acharyas, and finally to scriptures respected by the lineage of acharyas. “Hey ‘grandha rajama’ (king of scriptures), may there be auspiciousness with you.” Allow your eternal truth to shine within us, so that we can also walk that path revealed by you. Let us also pray to this scripture, Bhagavad Gita, and move forward.\n\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Sri:manna:rayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhu:la:ra,\nA person is affected by feelings in his heart more than by surrounding physical factors. Physical surroundings bring change only in one’s body, whereas thoughts arising in the heart bring change in one’s body and sankalpa (resolution) in different ways. A thought in the heart can create situations that otherwise wouldn’t exist.\nThe resolutions arising in one’s heart are highly influential. They contribute to one’s downfall or success. That is the reason one should always inculcate positive thoughts. The concept of ‘positive thinking’ mentioned these days is nothing but making sathsankalpas, good resolutions. In fact, Arjuna’s sankalpa in Bhagavad Gita was good, but tainted due to his arrogance. God decided to bring it to the right path and bestow the world with Bhagavad Gita philosophy through him. He transformed him as a means. He created a state of detachment, a kind of deep sorrow in him. God works on getting him to that state. This is what verse 27 reveals.\n\nSLOKA WORD - tha:n sami:kshya sa kaunthe:yaha sarva:n bandhu:n avastthitha:n | krupaya: paraya::vishto: vishi:dan idam abravi:th ||\nSLOKA MEANING - Arjuna is completely filled with intense sorrow.\nJust like a possessed person behaves uncontrollably, Arjuna was overwhelmed by krupa, overwhelming compassion. Krupa is a state of a person that cannot tolerate another person’s grief. He suffers until the other person is relieved from suffering. Arjuna was filled with this krupa, because he thought of Kauravas as relatives. If he had looked at them as enemies, then he would have been filled with valor to fight them. Krupa started melting Arjuna’s heart, akin to what heat does to ghee.\nWhen one’s melted heart traverses gradually and reaches a place, it is termed as visha:dam, sorrow. A person is said to be in sorrow, when his heart breaks (visarana), then moves (gathi) and reaches a place (avasa:dana). When this occurs intensely, it is termed ‘vi sha:d’. This is what Arjuna experiences. The important point is where it culminates. Everyone experiences sorrow at some point. What must we do? We must approach Elders instead of doing something in the throes of sorrow. We must reach out to Elders. Ve:da says:\n\nSLOKA WORD - sa gurume:va:bhi gacche:th samithpa:nihi:\nSLOKA MEANING - A guru is generally engaged in daily ho:ma, a way of worship. There are some essentials he needs such as samidha:s, wood, and cow-dung based sticks to ignite fire. It is recommended to procure such essentials and offer them to Guru so his trouble can be avoided, making it convenient for him.\n\nSLOKA WORD - samith pa:nihi\nSLOKA MEANING - holding samidhas\n\nSLOKA WORD - sa gurume:va:bhi gacche:th\nSLOKA MEANING - approach a guru\nWhat must the guru be like?\n\nSLOKA WORD - srothriyam bramha nishtam\nSLOKA MEANING - a guru must be one who must have heard and learned all the philosophical truths from his gurus\nOne must approach such a guru with sincere desire to listen to him. What does the guru do then? The guru gives appropriate messages which guide. Such Elders are termed gurus, depending on their state of course. In times of sorrow, Dhrutarashtra approached Sanjaya for guidance, and Duryodhana approached Dronacharya for guidance. Arjuna is in sorrow and fortunately, he is approaching Sri Krishna for guidance. As Sri Krishna is wise, he kept Arjuna in the right direction, but Sanjaya and Drona did not have that capability. Sanjaya was only a charioteer and therefore, Dhrutarashtra was not inclined to take his advice. Duryodhana approached Dronacharya, but he did not want to listen to him because he perceived him as an employee and felt that he should instruct him rather than take guidance. Thus, Dronacharya could not be of any benefit to Duryodhana even though the latter approached him.\nHowever, Sri Krishna is different. He handles situations correctly by being accessible when needed and being tough when necessary. He obeys Arjuna’s instructions as his charioteer but also takes control of the situation as the supreme commander of the entire universe. Arjuna resorted to the one who is capable in every way. Arjuna resorted to Sri Krishna in all means. He was ready to do whatever was recommended by Him. This is how Sri Krishna and Arjuna are different from the other two pairs. Arjuna approached Sri Krishna for support when he was in sorrow.\n\nSLOKA WORD - krupaya: paraya::vishtaha: vishi:dan idam abravi:th | SLOKA MEANING - If we want help, we should first express our feelings to the one we seek help from.\nWe should then listen to and follow his recommendations. Arjuna expressed his mental state to Sri Krishna from the 28th verse. We should carefully observe his words here. Arjuna is still arrogant. We discussed this. What Sri Krishna does is that He lets Arjuna’s melted heart flow, and then filters it to make it pure. That is His goal. Sri Krishna has tremendous experience in doing this while the other two, Sanjaya and Dronacharya, failed to do the same with their students, Dhrutarashtra and Duryodhana.\nHow did He do it? What did Arjuna say to Sri Krishna? Let’s pay attention to Arjuna’s words.\n\nSLOKA WORD - drushtwe:mam swajanam krushna! yuyuthsum sam upastthitham || SLOKA MEANING - He first mentions that everyone assembled here are his people - drushtwe:mam swajanam krishna! Why are they here? yuyuthsum sam upastthitham | they are all here to fight “I will be attacking and killing everyone in this war. Oh no! Killing one’s own people is sinful!”\nHe started expressing what he was feeling. He began with “Earlier, I was very excited and energetic to get ready for battle. However, now...”\n\nSLOKA WORD - si:danthi mama ga:thra:ni mukham cha parisushyathi | ve:patthus cha sari:re: me: ro:maharshas cha ja:yathe: || SLOKA MEANING - my senses are weak, drooping like useless dried leafy vegetable stalks my mouth is becoming dry my body is shivering with goosebumps\n\nSLOKA WORD - ga:ndi:vam sramsathe: hastha:th thwak chaiva paridahyathe: | na cha sakno:my avasttha:thum bhramathi:va cha me: manaha || SLOKA MEANING - without energy even to hold the bow in my hand my body temperature is rising, not sure how high it is now generally able to stand for long, however, I am now unable to stand on my own feet Why? I feel as if I am revolving, or the world is moving around me my mind is under the spell of some kind of hallucination or dizziness, Sri Krishna\n\nSLOKA WORD - nimittha:ni cha pasya:mi vipari:tha:ni kesava! | na cha sre:yo::nupasya:mi hathwa: swajanam a:have: || SLOKA MEANING - These words are very negative. Arjuna continues… “I am seeing many badomens, unable to sleep, unable to rest – I i.” na cha sre:yo::nupasya:mi don’t thinking this will bring nothing good good What is not going to bring any good? hathwa: swajanam a:have: killing my own people, oh no “Anyone fights to kill enemies and protect one’s own people, but how am I placed to fight with my own people?”\nLook at these statements from Arjuna, how incorrect! Are they his people? These are the same people who troubled Pandavas, in multiple ways including during their exile. Arjuna’s words here were extreme. Sri Krishna was angry at the way Arjuna referred to them as his own people. Not only Sri Krishna, our acharya, Gopalacharya Swami, would also feel upset.\nna cha sre:yo::nupasya:mi hathwa: swajanam a:have: Is that how Arjuna should be thinking? What good can happen by killing them? Shouldn’t he be thinking what good can happen if they remain alive, considering all the loss and troubles he faced because of them? It’s because Arjuna is no longer Arjuna. He is possessed by krupa, overwhelming compassion, and is under the direction of Hrushikesa, Sri Krishna! He is just speaking as directed by Lord. He is simply a mouthpiece. That’s all. He can do nothing more.\nWe are not sure if we believe in sakunas, omens. However, people say if the right eye twitches, it indicates a favorable future to some - if the left, then favorable to others. If the right shoulder feels like it’s trembling, it indicates a favorable future for males. If left shoulder, then for females. There are many such things. These are called nimitthas or sakunas, signs. Do they serve any purpose? A few groups say they don’t care about these. Even if one cares or not, it is a genuine response in nature. Nature doesn’t respond for its own purpose. It is in response to the entire infinite existence. A grass blade moves and has a beautiful effect somewhere else. A wave in a river or ocean results in some outcome. One moves this way, and another moves another way. Every movement results in an outcome. Can we recognize it or not? We may not recognize because the effect could be very minute, or in a format or location that we can’t understand. All this is part of God’s sankalpa.\nCertain people, mimamsakas, believe that every action creates something called apurva which exists until the result of the action is realized. However, we don’t see such an explanation in vedanta scriptures. When God sees a person doing a good activity, He wishes him a good outcome. If someone is doing something wrong, He provides a chance to rectify or mete out a disciplinary action. He decides what to do. God’s sankalpa, intention, is what puts one into action.\nHrushikesa puts you into one action. Krupa puts you into one action. Both of these brought Arjuna’s sorrowful state to where he wanted to express his feelings to Sri Krishna, and thereby follow His direction. Up to this point, he wanted to fight. Now, Arjuna is reaching a state where he wants to seek Lord’s refuge and listen. Hrushikesa is tuning him further. Let’s see what He says, what He does, and what He makes Arjuna do.\nJai Sri:manna:rayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Sri:manna:rayana!\nPriya Bhagavad Bandhu:la:ra,\nEvery movement in the world serves a purpose. A waving hand, a blinking eye, a moving leg, a blowing leaf, flowing air, a wandering cloud in the sky, or a flying bird! Every movement has a purpose. That’s because the entire world is one amazing machine! Large machines have several small parts or wheels that move within the big unit. The smaller parts also rotate. When they all rotate and move accordingly, the machine serves its purpose. Similarly, survival of the human body and the surrounding prakruthi (nature), depends on various movements. The purpose of certain movements can be noticed instantly, while some can never be noticed. However, that must not imply such movements are purposeless. We predict rain when we notice a dark cloud moving in the sky. When wind blows, the cloud thins as it showers rain. We can see this change. When a tree begins to sprout buds and then flower, we know it will yield fruit because the change is noticeable. These are some changes which we can see, but there are many more changes that cannot be seen. The changes that are noticeable are called sakunas or nimitthas, omens. What is the purpose of these omens?\nThere is a purpose for everything. Our sages have observed these for ages and given predictions accordingly using them as omens. Some omens could be favourable while others, unfavourable. A man stepped out of his house, he saw a fox. He wondered what direction he should take or avoid for a favourable outcome. He consulted an astrologer to find out, “I stepped out and saw foxes come by. In this situation, what direction do I take?” The astrologer replied that it does not matter what direction he takes, and advised him to walk safely without getting bitten by the fox. There is a belief that it is good to go from right to left, like a bird flying from your right to your left is good for you and the opposite is not. It could be that after ages of observing repeated outcomes of certain movements, our sages accordingly drafted predictions into scriptures.\nArjuna also noticed a few bad omens as he stood on the battlefield ready for war. Thus, he felt that the war was going to be unfavourable to him. He initially stepped onto the battlefield to wage war and get good results. Now, he is looking for omens to stop it from happening. Isn’t this surprising? This is an amazing transformation in Arjuna’s mindset, seen in the first chapter. What is the reason for this transformation? We know the reason for this change. It was Hrushikesa, the controller of senses, budding compassion in his heart resulting in the change of perspective. What are the omens he saw? He noticed all that a brave hero must not see! Shivering body. Inability to stand. Excessive sweating. Feeling weak. Losing the grip of his bow. This indicates that he had degraded to such a state. In fact, Arjuna’s bow represents him and therefore, his ego does not even let him put it down. Arjuna’s brother, Dharmaraja, once challenged him to put his bow down because he wasn’t capable. He pulled a sword on his brother out of anger. That shows how much he loves his bow! Such a brave one now says…\n\nSLOKA WORD - ga:ṇḍi:vam sramsathe: hasta:t tvak chaiva paridahyate\nSLOKA MEANING - feeling feverish and unable to hold the bow\nHe says that these omens indicate unfavourable results, they suggest bad consequences. An omen suggests an outcome, right? If Arjuna is seeing such omens, won’t he see bad results? Maybe! However, Arjuna won the war. So, what happened to the omens? Omens are like fire. Fire burns. However, if there is Indra Ni:la Ma:nikyam, a rare gem in your hand, the fire doesn’t burn you. Similarly, Arjuna is seeing all these omens. They are scaring him. However, he also has a gem, Indra Ni:la Mani, that can turn these omens into a favourable position. The gem of all gems, the one that gives all gems their glory. The divine gem is Sri Krishna. Hence, the fire of bad omens doesn’t burn him. Thus, there is nothing to worry about. Arjuna, however, continues to talk. He doesn’t stop here. He continues to deliver metta vedanta (immature and incomprehensive philosophy)!\nLet’s carefully observe...\n\nSLOKA WORD - nimittha:ni cha pasya:mi vipari:tha:ni ke:sava! |\nna cha sre:yo::nupasya:mi hathwa: swajanam a:have: ||\nSLOKA MEANING - Initially, he said, “What would I benefit by killing my own relatives? It is not good for me either.”\nUntil then, he did not think of them as relatives. Truly speaking, they are not. Who is related to whom? No one is related to anyone. All souls are related to God. These relations are a result of the human body, and one should behave accordingly. If one commits a mistake, let them be punished. If one does a good job, encourage them. If necessary, one must be eliminated too. The act of elimination happens through war. When there is war, there is victory and defeat. Arjuna says...\n\nSLOKA WORD - na ka:nkshe: vijayam krushna! na cha ra:jyam sukhani cha |\nkim no: ra:jye:na go:vinda! kim bho:gair ji:vithe:na va: ||\n\nSLOKA MEANING - “hey Sri Krishna, I don’t need war, I don’t need victory in war, I don’t need the kingdom that comes with victory, and I don’t need its associated pleasures.” “Why do I need a kingdom?” “Why do I want the pleasures of having the kingdom?” “The pleasures are meant to be relished along with everyone, what would be the purpose of these when I lose my people?” “What would I do alone with all these when I don’t have my own people?”\nReally, Arjuna shouldn’t be speaking this way. Sri Krishna is the one triggering Arjuna to speak this way. “Why do I need this life, when I don’t have relatives and when I cannot share joy with my relatives? I don’t need this life.” Our guru, Gopalacharya Swami, used to get livid at what Arjuna says further.\n\nSLOKA WORD - ye:sha:m artthe: ka:nkshitham no: ra:jyam bho:ga:s sukha:ni cha | tha ime::vastthitha: yuddhe: pra:na:ms thyakthwa: dhana:ni cha ||\nSLOKA MEANING - Explained beautifully in the 33rd verse. What did he say? one line ye:sha:m artthe: ka:nkshitham no: ra:jyam bho:ga:s sukha:ni cha | “The joy of pleasures as a result of owning a kingdom! Who is all this for?” “Isn’t it with all of them that I should be enjoying - with grandfathers, uncles, grandsons and cousins?!” “What do I do if I kill all of them?” “They are all standing in front of me on this battlefield ready to be killed by my arrows.” tha ime::avastthitha: yuddhe: standing in front of me as if they are inviting me to kill them He continued further, pra:na:ms thyakthwa: dhana:ni cha having lost their wealth, and their life, standing here Arjuna could see the truth. What is that truth? Earlier, Duryodhana said, ‘na:na: sasthra praharana:h sarve: yuddha visarada:h’. madarthe thyaktha ji:vitha:ha they are like dead bodies, without life Arjuna is saying the exact same statement now. pra:na:ms thyakthwa: dhana:ni cha they are standing here having left their wealth and life Who do I kill? Why kill those who are already dead? Does this mean everyone there is dead? It is shocking for us, but that is in fact the reality. Do you know why? The day when they insulted a woman, dragging her into the public assembly, pulled her hair and attempted to undress her, Sri Krishna made a solemn vow that same day.\n\nSLOKA WORD - dwastha: bhavanthu: datara:stra:ha\nSLOKA MEANING - They died that same day.\nHowever, in order to give credit to Pandavas, he left them like ‘dhagdha patalams’ (folded clothes which are burnt, but look intact until opened). Otherwise, they would have already dissolved in the air as ashes.\n\nSLOKA WORD - dagha patalam\nSLOKA MEANING - a burnt cloth\nLet’s say a cupboard or suitcase full of folded new clothes gets burnt. After it’s burnt, they still look intact, any numbers or letters can still be clearly seen. Normally, you could unfold clothes and wear them. However, although they look fine, they crumble when touched, making them completely useless.\nThe state of Kauravas is the same. They are like dhagdha patalas, burnt folded clothes, not useful for anything. Hence, they are equivalent to dead people. Sri Krishna says the same when presenting His vishwa rupam (eternal universal form)! He says to Arjuna - “Arjuna! Do you think you are killing them?” Arjuna is shell-shocked seeing the universal form. Sri Krishna says,\n\nSLOKA WORD - mayai ve:the nihatha:ha pu:rva meva:h nimittha ma:tram bhava savyasa:chan\nSLOKA MEANING - “on the same day when Draupadi was dragged into the courtyard, I turned them into ‘burnt bodies’”\n“As you are my dear Arjuna, I want you to take credit for ‘killing’ them and to emerge victorious.” “That’s why I have presented the burnt ones in front of you.”\nArjuna saw the same...\n\nSLOKA WORD - tha ime::avastthitha: yuddhe: pra:na:ms thyakthwa: dhana:ni cha || SLOKA MEANING - they are all standing here having lost all their wealth and life\nArjuna was thinking, “Oh, do I need to kill such people?” He was not thinking that there is no use sparing those who are already ‘dead’. He could see this reality but his mind was not willing to do what was needed. Arjuna’s visha:dam (sorrow), is deepening further as per the effect of Hrushikesa, the controller of senses.\nLet's see how this influences Arjuna further.\nJai Sri:manna:rayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus\nBhagavad Gita clearly depicts the myriad feelings that we experience in life. It tells us how to channelize these feelings. It gives the means to tackle them. It also depicts the benefits of streamlining the feelings. That is why Bhagavad Gita eternally holds great significance on this Earth. In Chapter 1, Arjuna, although a devotee, turns into an advisor to his master, God Himself. In general, a superior passes orders to his subordinates, or advises and suggests them. Sometimes, the subordinate claims this advisory capacity. In general, people love being an advisor over being a doer. People want to be in advisory capacity even with God. Sorrow-filled Arjuna gets into an advisory mode with Sri Krishna, his charioteer, his master, guide, well-wisher and caretaker. We must examine the 34th verse.\n\nSLOKA WORD - a:cha:rya:h pitharah puthra:ha thatthaiva cha pitha:maha:ha | ma:thula:s swasura:h pauthra:ha syala:s sambandhinas thattha: || SLOKA MEANING - He, Arjuna, says, “Sri Krishna! The opponents are not my enemies, they are my relatives.” [Sri Krishna responds] “These opponents, too, have been aware of this blood relation since their childhood.” “However, did they ever behave like relatives? Never!” “They have in fact set the stage for the war.” “Is it not your duty to take up the battle and teach them their limits?” “Instead, you are lamenting that they are your relatives, teachers, uncles, sons, grand children…”\nWhy this talk? What was Arjuna saying? a:cha:rya:h pitharah puthra:ha thatthaiva cha pitha:maha:ha | There are our grandfathers amongst those in front of us. There are children, father-like Elders, teachers, uncles, maternal uncles, grandchildren, brothers-in-law… …they are all my relatives.\n\nSLOKA WORD - e:tha:n na hanthum ichchha:mi ghnatho::pi madhusu:dana! | SLOKA MEANING - even if they slaughter me, I don’t want to fight or slay them\nThe one who came to seek advice, is now being vocal about his decisions. This reflects Arjuna’s dejection reaching an extreme state due to the effect of Hrushikesa (controller of senses), God taking control of his senses. God started cleansing his heart completely. It led Arjuna to not only give orders to Sri Krishna and the others, but also to make decisions. In general, one experiences greater joy working in a team even if there is only one person making decisions. It gives a chance to teach the rest of the team too if he includes others in the team. However, the situation is different here. Arjuna has come to a state where he is not only advising Sri Krishna but also voicing his decisions aloud, indicating that he didn’t care about the outcome. ghnatho::pi madhusu:dana! let them butcher me, Sri Krishna e:tha:n hanthum aham ne:chchha:mi I do not want to kill them He did not stop there. He continued, “Krishna! I won’t do such an act even if all the three worlds are offered to me, let alone this small kingdom.” “I do not want even Vaikunta, the permanent abode of God, if it requires killing and torturing relatives and others.” Here, there isn’t anything, just a temple and open space.\n\nSLOKA WORD - api thrailo:kya ra:jyasya he:tho:h… e:tha:n na hanthum ichchha:mi SLOKA MEANING - even if all the three worlds are offered to me, I will not kill such people\n“Even after so much bloodshed, I will get a small kingdom, not even the three worlds.” “Not even the whole earth, just a small kingdom.” “Just for this, why should I go on a killing spree?” kinnu mahi:kruthe: Why go through all this just for a small kingdom?\n\nSLOKA WORD - nihathya dha:rthara:shtra:n naha ka: pri:this sya:th jana:rdana! | SLOKA MEANING - Hey Jana:rdhana! The word ‘Jana:rdhana’ is embedded with beauty. Do I feel happy by killing Dha:rthara:shtra:, Duryodhana and the rest of Dhrutarashtra’s progeny? Do you kill your relatives? Aren’t you Jana: + ardhana, the one who decimates the evils? You are not one who kills relatives, right? ka: pri:this sya:th jana:rdana! then why are you asking me to do that\nSri Krishna asks, “What is wrong in punishing wrong-doers?” Arjuna responds, “Krishna! Though they may be committing sinful acts while in the kingdom, we are no less than them in this aspect.” “Are we not committing so many sins? Thus, there is no point in killing them, because…”\n\nSLOKA WORD - pa:pame:v a:sraye:d asma:n hathwaithan a:thatha:yinaha || SLOKA MEANING - “If at all we kill these sinners, who are my own cousins, we acquire sin.” “If we commit sins, how can we attain happiness?”\nSri Krishna says, “Do you know who they are? They are a:thatha:yis.” Sri Krishna reminds Arjuna, questioning him on how he is able to show pity on those… “…who set your houses on fire…” “who drowned you and tried to kill you with poison...” “who insulted your wife in the assembly...” “Think about those atrocities.” Arjuna then answers Sri Krishna. hathwaithan a:thatha:yinaha They are all ‘a:thatha:yis’. Some mistakenly spell the word as ‘a:katha:yi’ , but it is ‘a:thatha:yi:s’ not ‘a:katha:yi’. ‘A:thatha:yi:s’ are those who commit six dreadful sins. Six or a few of the six dreadful sins.\n\nSLOKA WORD - agni: daha: garada:schaiva sastra pa:ni: hi dana:paha: kshe:tra da:ra:harascha shadaithe:hi, a:thatha:inaha: SLOKA MEANING - Today, he is showing pity on Kauravas. However, Kauravas committed all these sins against him and the rest of the Pandavas, in spite of being their relatives... ...without any pity and remorse. What did they do? Agni daha (they tried to set their house on fire), Gana: daha (they tried to poison them with food and then drown them in water), Sastra pa:nihi (they tried to kill them with weapons), Dana:paha (they tried to steal their kingdom and wealth), Kshe:tra da:rahara:schai:va (they tried to steal their land and wife forcefully).\nKauravas attempted to this also with Pandavas. They usurped their kingdoms, and in the pretext of gambling, stole all their wealth. Finally, they insulted their wife in an unimaginable way. Hence they are rightly termed ‘a:thatha:yis’. Do you know what scriptures state about the punishment for such crimes? Any criminal is given punishment and hence justice is served. Not everyone is given the same punishment. Unfortunately, in our country, even after being proven guilty for trying to kill the prime minister of the country or worse, criminals are allowed to plead for mercy in high courts, or further in supreme court. He can continue to plead for mercy to the president of the country. Not sure how this is thought through or permitted, there are some recent instances of such.\nKauravas are ‘a:thatha:yis’. They committed all kinds of sins. agni daha, gara daha set fire, poisoned sasthra pa:nihi tried to kill them with weapons ...stole their kingdom, wealth and wife. Scriptures say,\n\nSLOKA WORD - a:thatha:yinam a:ya:ntham hanya:de:va avicha:rayan SLOKA MEANING - such persons should be decimated immediately without a second thought\nBecause if such people are excused, they may perpetuate such sins further and harm more people. Such people can motivate others, form groups, and cause greater harm. Hence, they should never be excused. Even for their sake, so they do not commit more crimes, it is advised that an end is put to their actions. Scriptures dictate to kill such people immediately. Today, Arjuna is saying he does not want to kill them. He wants to stop the war. He is making all kinds of statements. pa:pame:v a:sraye:d asma:n hathwaithan a:thatha:yinaha thasma:th na:rha: vayam hanthum dha:rtha ra:shtra:n saba:ndhava:n “I don’t want to punish all these people related to Dhrutarashtra.” “They are like my brothers and relatives.” na:rha: vayam hanthum I’m not eligible to kill them, not eligible Sri Krishna asks, “Even if you feel so, would they remain passive? Wouldn’t they come to kill you?” Even for this question, Arjuna has an answer. Let’s listen in our next session.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "3. Main Content:\nJai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavad Bandhus (Dear Devotees of God).\nBhagavad Gita's first chapter is Arjuna Vishada Yoga (the yoga of Arjuna's dejection). This chapter reveals the intense sorrow experienced by Arjuna. With a heavy heart, Arjuna approached Krishna. Whenever grief-struck, it is recommended to approach a guru.\nsa: gurume:va:bhigachche:th\nArjuna approached his guru, Krishna, and expressed his grief. When we approach a Guru, we simply need to explain our state of sorrow. We should not propose a solution ourselves or impose our ideas. We should not reference guidelines from scriptures to our gurus. We approach them for advice. Why should we convey our views / ideas? However, Arjuna does exactly this. This is unexpected from Arjuna. Krishna desired that Arjuna should seek advice before He gave His message.\nLet us see how Arjuna expresses his grief, in the 38th and 39th verses of the first chapter.\n\nSLOKA WORD - yadyapye:the: na pasyanthi, lo:bho:pahatha che:thasaha kulakshaya krutham do:sham, mithra dro:he cha pa:thakam SLOKA MEANING - (On our side are) yourself, and Bhishma, and Karna, and Kripa (who is) ever-victorious in battle, and also Ashwatthama, Vikarna, and Saumadatti.\nkatham na nge:yamasma:bhihi, pa:pa:d asma:n nivarthithum kulakshaya krutham do:sham, prapasyadbhir jana:rdana !\nArjuna is addressing the Lord – “Oh, Janardana...”\n“Kauravas are not able to comprehend the losses of this war. They are all set to wage the war and are confident of their victory.”\n“They don’t know that they are not going to win the war.”\n“Hence, they are acting as such. Is it not our duty to tell them?”, says Arjuna\nyadyapye:the: na pasyanthi If they are unable to see the consequences, what will they do? Kauruvas will lose ultimately, like a moth loses its life over a candle flame. Alas! They are unable to understand. Because their minds are shrouded. With what? Shrouded with soot. What type of soot? lo:bha with greed. Everything is for me, extremely covetous!\nVeda (a type of scripture) states that greed is undesirable. Veda teaches, ‘ma: grudhaha’. Never be covetous. Give generously all that is graced to you by God.\nHowever, the greed in us is apahatha (striking), hitting our che:thas (mind). Mind, manas, on its own, is good. In fact, Manas is an instrument that belongs to God. However, our own flaws, greed makes people more and more covetous. “My wealth is not enough. I need to usurp all my neighbors’ wealth as well.”\nWe may wonder, are Kauravas like that? Who is Arjuna referring to? It is said that his gurus and a:cha:rya:s (spiritual teachers) are also in the army. Are all of them greedy? Was Dronacharya greedy? Or Bhishmacharya? In reality, it is only people like Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana who were greedy. They have a che:thasaha (mind) that is badly hathaha (affected) by lo:bha (greed). However, poor Bhishma and others also acquired this flaw from them without their knowledge. Why? The ones affected by greed are Duryodhana and Dhrutarashtra. Bhishma, Drona and others are well-wishing Elders. They are expected to rectify the greedy ones. If a person is not listening, they have the authority to dole out punishment and correct the person. However, what are they doing? They have taken the duty of protecting the greedy Duryodhana and his army. This is their mistake.\nProtecting the complete cohort of greedy people, including Dhruthrashtra, Duryodhana, Sakuni, and Karna, and the kingdom.\nlo:bho:pahathaha duryo:dhanaha the one hit by greedy nature is Duryodhana. These Elders have their che:thas on Duryodhana. Hence Bhishma, Drona, et al are also ‘lo:bho:pahatha che:thas’, struck with greed. Thus, Arjuna was correct in referring to them as such in this verse. lo:bho:pahatha chethasaha how do we kill such people now, oh Lord Even more, “Oh Krishna! If we fight this war now...”\nkulakshaya krutham do:sham, mithra dro:he cha pa:thakam\nwe will become responsible for destroying our own kulam (family/dynasty).\nIt would be analogous to axing the branch of the tree that we are sitting on. I am going to destroy my own family, my own dynasty through this war. Not just that. Many of these kings are my close friends. Due to the war, I will be forced to kill them. If I do that, am I not deceiving my own friends? I will be called mithra-dro:hi (a man who cheats his friends). There is no atonement for the man who betrays his friends. Should I commit such a sin? Such a big sin! Isn’t this common sense?\nkatham na nge:yamasma:bhihi, pa:pa:d asma:th nivarthithum kulakshaya krutham do:sham, prapasyadbhihi\nKauravas don’t have the sense that they will be destroying their own caste and dynasty. Leave them aside. However, I have that knowledge. We Pandavas have that knowledge. We all, including yourself, have that knowledge. If they are ready for war because they lack this sense, at least we, who have that knowledge, should prevent this war and pursue other activities. Why should we make the same mistake of destroying our own caste, destroying lives with war? It’s fine if they are ready for war out of ignorance. What is the excuse for us, despite knowing everything? It is very wrong! What happens when the dynasty is destroyed? What will be the result of this war? We must know this.\n\nSLOKA WORD - kula kshaye: pranasyanthi, kula dharma:s sana:thana:ha dharme: nashte: kulam kruthsnam, adharmo: ’bhibhavathyutha SLOKA MEANING - (When the kula, or dynasty, is destroyed, its sanatana, or eternal, practices are lost. When dharma is lost, the whole clan is overcome by unrighteousness.)\nArjuna thinks he is revealing an ‘important aspect’ in this 40th verse to Krishna. Arjuna is ‘teaching’ the Lord, the personification of dharma (righteous duty) itself. He is ‘teaching’ the Lord whose actions themselves are dharma. What message is he teaching?\nkula kshaye: pranasyanthi kula dharma:ha\nEach caste has a set of its own dharmas (righteous practices). If these warriors die, what will happen to those practices? Dharmas will all be uprooted. What type of dharmas are these?\nsana:thana:ha those that never change.\nSome ignorant people say “Castes are man-made, we set our own caste-specific practices.” Arjuna is not saying so in this verse.\nkula dharma:ha sana:thana:ha caste-based differences in practices are all eternal. These people know the practices to the core, mastered them, knowing the ins and outs.\nIf they lose lives in warfare, what is the result? This caste and associated practices will be lost. If dharma (righteous practices) perish, what will happen?\ndharme: nashte: kulam kruthsnam, adharmo: ’bhibhavathyutha\nIf the people knowing dharma and practice perish in the war, then we are left only with people who are not aware of dharma. What is the use of such people living?\ndharme: nashte if dharma, righteousness is lost, the entire caste system will be gone.\nAdharma (unrighteousness) prevails. adharmo: bhibhavathyutha. When adharma becomes dominant, then what is the purpose of castes even if they remain?\nThe war we are about to indulge in, brings all these bad consequences. Oh Krishna! Is this apt for us? Should we get ready to do such a negative thing? Should I gear up to do such a bad thing? Alas! Why are You making me perform such an evil act? When adharma becomes prominent, when inappropriate activities find their way into the clans, then…\n\nSLOKA WORD - adharma:bhibhava:th krushna, pradushyanthi kula sthriyaha SLOKA MEANING - (When unrighteousness prevails, the women of the family become unchaste and corrupt.)\nWhen the man of the house is no more, the woman has to take care of the household. If due to ignorance, forbidden activities make way into the household. Women might be forced to support households themselves without an earning spouse. Thus, chances of compromising their principles increase. Circumstances might force them to become corrupted. They may stray away from righteousness.\n\nSLOKA WORD - stri:shu dushta:su va:rshne:ya !, ja:yathe: varna sankaraha SLOKA MEANING - (When women become unchaste, it leads to the intermixing of races.)\nstri:shu dushta:su when women give up principles and indulge in malpractices ja:yathe: varna sankaraha the system of races will get badly mixed up.\nIn this verse, by Arjuna’s words, we know that the kula (dynasty/family) and varna (social classification) are distinct from each other. We will know about these in detail, sometime later. What are castes? What are races? What is the origin of a caste? What is the origin of a race? Are there separate activities assigned for these castes, races? What are they termed? They are dharmas or a:charas (practices). Who upholds dharmas? It is up to the women to uphold these practices. In essence, a woman is the protector of dharma. As long as we protect her carefully, dharmas will be firmly established. If a woman is unprincipled, dharmas get uprooted. What an important role the woman plays in society! Our Indian society recognizes the woman as the protector of dharma. Hence it is imperative that society takes care of women very well. It is not just for her sake that we need to take care of a woman. It is for the sustenance of society.\nChapter one of Bhagavad Gita reveals this insight. Let us further understand this in greater detail.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "3. Main Content:\nJai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavad Bandhulara (Dear Devotees of God),\nChapter 1 in Bhagavad Gita contains words that incite controversies in today’s society and which are heavily criticized globally.\nHowever, we must not forget that the words depict the existing system. In any case, it is a well-wisher’s responsibility to give unequivocal advice on how the system should operate. It is the listener’s decision to what extent he wants to hear and implement. However, the well-wisher needs to reveal all aspects of that topic without withholding any details. Every commodity we purchase has an ingredients list, directions on usage, consequences of not using it in the prescribed manner, etc. It is up to the buyer to buy it or not.\nThe producer fulfills his responsibility by listing all the information about the commodity. Ironically it’s all printed in the smallest font which is neither easy to read nor comprehend. The buyer doesn’t read most of it and uses the product as he wishes, reaping the effects of the same, good and bad.\nFor example, I recently heard an advertisement about toothpaste. It spoke about the adverse effects of toothpaste on bones and teeth as it contains fluoride. The harmful effects of giving this to children from a young age and using more than the required amount was condemned. This fact is indeed mentioned on the package by the producer, but in extremely small font. Hence, it's not their mistake. Font being too small to read and not paying enough attention is our fate. The producer did not do anything wrong because he cautions, “Keep it away from kids, don’t use it for those below six months, anyone else must also use only an advised amount.” Someone recently informed us that everything is written on the package. The producer reveals all the information about its shortcomings, its form, and its nature clearly because it is his responsibility.\nHowever, whether he conveys it in a visible font or vaguely is his discretion. SMOKING CIGARETTES IS HAZARDOUS. This is clearly written on every cigarette box, but in the smallest font. So, it is not the producer’s fault. He clearly stated what needs to be expressed. “It is your responsibility to see it when you want to buy it. If you want to be healthy, don’t buy it. Did I pressurize you to buy it?” claims the cigarette producer. This is the thought process of current society. The same is the case with alcohol. It is the same with all allopathy medicines. Poison... Allopathic medicines have the label “poison”. They caution the consumers to strictly use it based on the prescription of a qualified physician only. It is not the manufacturer’s mistake. Not using discretion during consumption is the consumer’s fault. All current businesses use such discretely deceitful methods to become successful.\nHowever rushis (sages), munis (sages), and acharyas (spiritual teachers) never concealed anything in our scriptures. They clearly elucidated knowledge in layman terms. They ensured everyone has access to it. They even predicted what would happen in the future. It is up to you whether you recognize it, accept it, respect it, and follow it or not as you have the intelligence to judge. But our sages never minced words while advising. They never used hidden or indirect or misleading methods to impart knowledge.\nWords like:\nkula (caste)\njati (creed)\nvarnam (race)\npindam (gratitudinal offerings to ancestors)\npitru (ancestors)\nsraddhas (annual ceremonies to ancestors)\nvarna sankaryam (union of different races)\nvarna dharmas (recommended righteous paths for each race)\nThese words are controversial and are liable to face criticism these days. Today’s society doesn’t tolerate such words at all.\nWesterners have succeeded in diverting our attention from such concepts. Before leaving, the British cleverly tailored our educational system and instituted new laws destroying the very foundation of our country in every way possible.\nIs caste or clan bad? Is creed bad? Is race bad? We hear many people often say, “All these should go away! We need an equitable society. We must eradicate all these!!” Surprisingly, those very people who come to the forefront, inciting and corrupting society with such speeches... devote their whole life donating their wealth, and time safeguarding the same - i.e. caste groups and creed groups and put in effort for the upkeep of these groups!\nMentioning of caste in certificates, asking for reservations, political parties using these for their benefit... political leaders’ behavior on seat allocation based on caste, their focus on the caste of a person who is leading a province... all these only exemplify that they do not have any intention at all of abolishing them. If those leaders are really serious about eradicating such systems, it’s very simple to accomplish. They can wipe them out from the system immediately. How? What can they do? All they need to do is remove those columns on birth certificates. That’s all!\nSome might argue that people belonging to certain categories have faculty deficiencies or intellectual short-comings with lower mental ability. Such people will always be backward. Hence they need those reservations. If you are really magnanimous and concerned about them, take steps to make the ‘slow learners’ and people with low grasping power become capable, efficient, and competent. To make them capable, qualified and successful, appoint 2 to 3 teachers instead of one. If an ordinary student needs one teacher, arrange for 2 to 3 teachers to teach such students, thus making them competent, capable and proficient. Efforts should be focused on increasing their mental faculties and enriching their wisdom. Instead saying, “It’s enough if you score 20 out of 100, it’s okay if you don’t study,” will only lead to destroying their inherent mental powers, making them useless.\nAre such steps taken out of concern, pity, and desire to uplift them? Society must think about this. Indeed, the entire society need not think about this. Those sections of the society who believe that they are benefitting from such schemes should reflect on it. It is their responsibility. If one section really desires to become able, proficient, accomplished, qualified and lead a good life, it should demand abolishing of reservation and strengthen their capabilities. They should question, “Make us capable on par with others. When there is a person who scores 99% because of his mental faculties…”...why are you encouraging us to just remain at a baseline of 22%, 30%, 35%, or 10% marks or just enough for promotion?” In such a case, what should they demand? “Help us enhance our abilities and score not 99%, but 100%! Please put in efforts to increase our capabilities.”\nThat is what a person who wants to progress should do. It is only then that society will flourish. How will society progress with inefficient people? For a society to be strong, each and every person should be capable. Efforts should be put in to develop society in that manner.\nIf you want to be healthy, your skin, muscles, nerves, bones, fat, and blood should be in good condition. If one is enfeebled with bones deficient in calcium, low WBC count, muscles losing tone, and nerves getting destroyed, how will he survive? What lifestyle will he lead? Similarly if a society wants to make its mark in this world, how should each and every person be? They should be able and competent. Just as all parts of the body should be in good condition to be physically fit, a robust society must have capable, proficient and accomplished citizens.\nTo make various groups of people in society able and competent, shouldn’t they be provided with the required support? Giving subsidies and effortless distribution of money under various schemes... Incentives such as giving away free licenses, opening liquor shops day and night to drink and sleep, distribution of fertilizers which spoil the soil, corrupting crops… Eat freely, you are not required to do anything, just eat, sleep, drink, enjoy – is this the foresight of a leader? Will society flourish under such leadership? Abusing the animals which give manure, destroying plants and fauna, harming the people who consume them and finally destroying themselves?\nIs this the responsibility of leadership? Is this the responsibility of citizens who bring such leaders to power? All in the world have come into existence to do only good and not otherwise. It might be kula, varna, jati, dharma (righteous duty), or eligibility. All these have a purpose. However, a man should have proper discretion on how, when, and where to use them. Then, this society will be free from the turbulence it is facing now.\nOur purvacharyas (ancestral teachers), acharyas (spiritual teachers) in lineage such as the great Bhagavad Ramanujacharya, clearly instructed us on what, how, where, why, and when to use them. Hence, such gurus became Jagadgurus (gurus to the entire world). They never discarded systems – kulam (family/dynasty), jati (creed), varna (social classification), dharma (righteous duty). However, today’s modern practices are decimating them and destroying the entire society.\nBhagavad Gita chapter 1 lays a right foundation with the hope to teach us how to inculcate them appropriately in our lives. Hence, the first chapter brings forth these controversial words. Let us understand and use them properly.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n================================================================================"

He should clearly explain his problem. Only then, the doctor will be able to prescribe appropriate medicine. Krishna is a highly capable doctor.\nve:dyo: vaidyaha sada: yo:gi: (a name of God in Vishnu Sahasra Nama)\nve:dyo: vaidyaha is a knowledgeable doctor. He is also ‘sada: yo:gi:’ (always a Yogi), very capable of curing ‘disease’ if related to health – the provider of good health. Bhagavad Gita is a wonderful medicine prescribed by Him.\nHe identified possible ailments potentially troubling society. He maneuvered Arjuna to mention those ailments and planned on prescribing appropriate solutions. In the first chapter, Krishna, Hrishikesa (controller of everyone's senses), made Arjuna mention all those ailments even though they were not needed in context.\nWhat are those illnesses?\nVerses 40 to 44 in the first chapter of Gita – in five verses, all the details regarding these were mentioned by the Lord in detail. In his questions, Arjuna asked all these:\nWhat is kulam (caste)?\nja:thi (clan)?\nvarnam (race)?\ndharmam (practices, roles, and responsibilities of various people), the concept of pitru devatas (ancestors)?\nnarakam (hell)?\nswargam (heaven)?\npindamulu (offerings made to ancestors after their death) and tharpanamulu (offerings)?\nAll these terms are ostracized in modern society. Similarly, the system of marriage, blending of races – such topics are also discussed here. In recent days, these topics are the cause for fury. These terms sound illegal, as if discussing these topics needs to be condemned. People feel action needs to be taken against people who discuss such topics. People who talk about these topics are treated as pests to society that need to be exterminated.\nHowever, it is our responsibility to understand them. A person who wants to preserve his health should be told what constitutes health and what is disease. He should be in a position to understand symptoms of disease and the signs of good health. Only then, he would want to get rid of the illness and seek good health.\nSimilarly, it is necessary to know what are the ailments for a healthy society and what constitutes good health. That is why Sri Krishna, as Hrishikesa, provoked Arjuna from within to utter certain words. What are they?\nWhen a war like this happens or for that matter, whenever any war happens, youth lose their lives. Only elderly in the houses and young children remain along with the women who take care of them. What do women do? They are stuck with the responsibility of having to take care of their families. They might be forced to adopt inappropriate means to earn, leading to their and the society’s downfall. Such a society is no better than hell.\nNot only is that dangerous to them, but it also pulls their ancestors, who have reached higher planes with their good karma, back to this plane. Thus, these people reach such a horrible state that their sins downgrade their ancestors from exalted places.\n\nSLOKA WORD - sankaro: naraka:yaiva, kulghna:na:m kulasya cha pathanthi pitharo: hye:sha:m, lupta pinda-udaka-kriya:ha SLOKA MEANING - (The mixing of races leads to hell for the destroyers of the family and for the family itself. The ancestors of these people fall (to hell) because the rituals of pinda and water are no longer offered.)\nThe departed souls, ancestors, will lack family members to offer pindas and udakas or tharpanas (offerings of gratitude to ancestors). That is because eligible people to make those offerings to them have died in the war.\npathanthi pitharaha - “Won’t ancestors degrade in higher worlds due to lack of food and water”, Arjuna asked.\nAll those involved in leading society to such a state also will see downfall.\n\nSLOKA WORD - do:shaire:thaih kulghna:na:m, varna sankara ka:rakaihi uthsa:dyanthe: ja:thi dharma:ha, kula dharma:scha sa:swatha:ha SLOKA MEANING - (By these faults of the family destroyers, which create the mixing of races, the eternal practices of clan and family are destroyed.)\nThose flaws will grow, spoiling ancestry and lineage. uthsa:dyanthe: ja:thi dharma:ha, kula dharma:scha sa:swatha:ha\nThose which need to be protected always, are called ‘sa:swathas’ (eternal). ‘Dharmas’ refers to practices, arts, and crafts. These practices and crafts should always be protected. Some families are dedicated to protecting such practices, arts, and crafts. However, when it is time to defend the mother-land, youth from such families are drafted to participate in wars. If they lose their lives in those wars, then that household loses protection, resulting in unrestrained behavior, leading to the downfall of the family members. That in turn leads to the downfall of their ancestors too who are in higher worlds.\nTheir ja:thi dharmas (habits, works, arts, and crafts) then are gradually lost. These are to be protected forever. Arjuna also differentiates between varna-dharmas (practices followed by the race / category of people), and kula-dharmas (crafts and practices followed by the lineage or caste of people). All of these are lost.\nThose who are the cause for such a bad outcome… uthsanna kuladharma:na:m, manushya:na:m Jana:rdana\n…become the cause of rooting out practices and crafts by waging wars to fulfill their greed… ‘narake: niyatham va:saha bhavathi’, ithi anu-susruma\n…such people also migrate to other worlds after their death someday. When they leave the mortal body, they most certainly take a downward path toward hell. Not only experiencing hell once, in the hope of returning to a better situation later…no! For such people, narake: niyatham va:saha bhavathi. The messengers of Yama will ensure Hell as certain.\nnarake: niyatham va:so: bhavathi ithi anu-susruma\nSastras (scriptures) tell us this. Arjuna says, “Oh Lord, we will also fall to hell as a result of leading them in a bad path and causing the war to happen.” “What a pity! We wanted to be good. Yet, this war is leading us to hell.” “Is this appropriate? Do we really need such a war?”\nHe says further -\n\nSLOKA WORD - aho: ! batha ! mahath pa:pam karthum, vyavasitha: vayam yad ra:jya-sukha-lo:bhe:na, hanthum sva-janam udyatha:ha SLOKA MEANING - (Alas, what a great sin we are determined to commit! From the greed for kingdom and its pleasures, we are ready to kill our own relatives.)\n“We are getting ready to kill our own people, our own relatives because of greed for kingdom and luxuries.”\nhanthum sva-janam\n“This is not a good thing to do. Oh Lord, I can’t do this!” These words are all uttered by Arjuna. These are not our own compilations. We must know what he clarified to us through this.\n“kulas should prevail”\n“jathis should exist”\nArjuna used the words ja:thi (clan) and ‘varnam’ (race) in the same sense interchangeably. Thus, ‘ja:thi dharmam’ and ‘varna-dharmam’ have the same meaning. ‘Ja:thi’ refers to the structure giving an object its identity. It is also called ‘avayava samstha:nams’, technically. It is ‘ja:thi’ and also termed ‘varnam’. These ‘varnas’ are sa:swathas (eternal). Each ‘varna’ (race), has its own practices. These are referred to as ‘dharma’. ‘Kulas’ (castes), exist and each caste has its own practices as well. These practices are ageless. The practices of castes and races are forever. We should not tamper with them. This is one aspect that Arjuna clarified to us.\nSecondly, what does dharma do? Dharma supports one’s mortal body in this world and bestows higher worlds after the current life... only when it is practiced correctly. However, what happens to those people who distort the entire structure of kula and varna... who distort all the righteous practices... who fail the women, the protectors of dharma, thereby causing varna-sa:nkaryam (inter group relationships giving birth to those who do not belong to one kula)... who cause all such chaos...\nSuch ‘dharma’ leads them to hell. narake: niyatham va:saha bhavathi. Such practice is not called ‘dharma’. Because the very definition of the word “dharma” is practice which gives happiness in both this world and the next world.\ndharma is defined as:\n‘abhyudaya, nissre:yasa siddhihi yathaha, saha dharmaha’\n‘abhyudaya’ means happiness in this mortal world, derived from various objects and activities. It is limited to this mortal world. What is such happiness termed? Abhyudaya, as it is confined to this world. The same practice or activity must lead one to happiness even after leaving the mortal body. Happiness in other worlds is termed nissre:yasa. yathaha abhyudaya, nissre:yasa siddhihi that practice which bestows both abhyudaya and nissre:yasa is defined as ‘dharma’.\nIn essence, ‘dharma’ means righteous practices. These practices vary based on kula (caste) and ja:thi (race). Ja:thi, or varna, comes by birth. Our form did not manifest by our own choice – size of nose, mouth, eye, forehead, color / length / shape of hair, ear, throat, chin, cheeks, the size and shape of spine, etc. From top to bottom, it has a predefined form. None of this came to us by our choice. It came by birth. Such a way of formation manifested by birth is termed ja:thi or varna (clan / race).\nTo ensure that the social customs, which help in leading a better life, are maintained, there are certain boundaries laid. They are called kulas. There is a set of activities established by birth, like eating food, drinking water, breathing air – these are common to everyone. Then, for the sake of livelihood, there are other boundaries laid down. For example, if someone establishes a company, it has a set of rules. For a different company, another set of rules. Thus, to lead life in society harmoniously, certain guidelines - One should do a certain activity in a certain manner, another person should do another activity in a different way, etc. So there are groups of people co-located performing related activities. That is a caste or kula.\nAll the sages collectively constitute the caste of sages - ‘Rushi kulam’. People collectively performing another activity constitute another caste and so on. Such castes have a set of practices or activities. Generations after generations people in a caste master those skills and activities through practice. There are a set of rules to perform activities which come to us by birth - ‘ja:thi dharma’. These practices should never be tampered with. As long as these practices are preserved, life will be smooth. Ja:thi dharmas (the practices which come by birth) and kula dharmas (the practices which come by caste) are distinct.\nLet us take an example of a gold-smith. He knows the techniques in that work from his childhood. Even a highly educated person from another caste will not be able to do the work of a goldsmith equally as well. That is the mastery gained in that craft. Such groups of craftsmen which are co-located are called castes. Whereas, classification based on birth is called Ja:thi. Each group has a set of skills.\nThe son of a farmer knows the basics of agriculture from his childhood, such as when to sow, water, not to water, harvest, how to classify the harvest, etc. Even a person with a master’s degree in agriculture may not know these so well. Thus, both ja:thi dharmas and kula dharmas are crafts. If these are well-preserved, techniques in those crafts will survive for ages. If we tamper with those practices, expertise in those areas is lost. We will then be left with only superficial, raw work. Our elders wanted to preserve these practices by all means. Bhagavad Gita chapter 1 mentions and presents them accordingly.\nWe too should try to understand this. Let us do that.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "3. Main Content:\nJai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavad Bandhulara (Dear Devotees of God),\nIn ancient times, people made beautiful statues. When visiting an ancient temple, you will see beautiful statues. Observing them in detail, one can grasp the skill and diligence of the sculptor in those beautiful works. Whether they are stone-carved or metal-carved, in a metal-carved sculpture of God, one can appreciate the precision in the hands, the slenderness of the fingers, and the visibility of nails. One can also see intricate details in the eyes. In the neck, we see the lines clearly. The sculpting mastery is easily noticeable. These timeless sculptures are now termed antique and are valued at millions of rupees.\nWe see sculptures even today. However, they are shoddy and inanimate. A modern-day sculpture’s hand, for example, looks slapdash, like the hand of a person wearing a PPE kit. No detail is visible in these sculptures. It is rare to find impressive modern-day sculptures. Whereas in ancient sculptures, even a mini statue has all the intricate details in the head, nose, eyes, ears, teeth, and hair — every minute part of the sculpture. We think technology has advanced these days. There is technological advancement in every area. Even in machinery, there is computerization. Still, sculptural beauty is hard to find.\nSculptors lack patience; thus, there is no beauty in sculptures these days. However, this was not the case in the ancient days. Every sculpture was beautiful. Stone sculptures need no special mention. Even when humongous, they were still majestic and beautiful. In South India, you can see how far-and-wide these temples are. The stones used to build these temples are enormous. Big machines like cranes are available these days. Thousands of years ago, there were no such machines. How did people sculpt, build, and fix such huge structures with so much beauty?\nOne can see the wonderful Egyptian pyramids built around 8000 years ago. Top to bottom, what a sculptural marvel! With modern technology, you cannot bring that beauty or life into the art.\nWhy are we discussing this? To understand that when such arts are carefully preserved, their innate beauty remains intact, and their eternity is preserved. This is attributed to any object.\nApproximately 125 years ago, an Indian weaver wrapped a 9-yard saree in a matchbox and presented it to the British queen. Imagine the skill of this great Indian weaver. Can you guess how he was rewarded? The queen invited him to her country to teach this skill to people there. Later, she ruthlessly severed his fingers so he could never exhibit his skill again. That is how the queen rewarded the Indian weaver. Similarly, all artistic skills of our country have been destroyed. The artistic pieces we see today are lifeless, spiritless, and useless. Yet, we think they are amazing.\nObserving these ancient works, one cannot stop wondering how these magnificent structures were made. One can deduce the importance ancient cultures gave to the Arts. There was no machinery, neither computers nor present day advanced technology. The skill was in the sculptor’s hands. Because, they followed their dharma (righteous duty) and protected the skill associated with it. The roots of those skills and dharma are kula (caste) and ja:thi (clan/race).\nVarnam, or ja:thi, translates to ‘race’. Caste is different. Castes preserve arts that come by the lineage, and race preserves what comes by birth. We want to preserve what comes by birth and by caste. We want race and caste to be intact. Why are the caste and race systems being destroyed? The country was prospering, so in order to ruin this society, these had to be destroyed. That was the thought. Even after independence, we haven’t changed, following the path of destruction.\nArguing that the caste system leads to fights, quarrels, ostracization from the society, and chaos is wrong. Ancient society was not like this. This discrimination started sometime later. Sometime back, these were created, fabricated in the societal fabric and brought about disparity, suppression and unrest in society. Who created this furore? Foreigners who could not accept the growth of this nation. Tyrants who occupied this land. Turks on one side and Englishmen on the other side. They joined forces to destroy these arts at once. In effect, they brought about differences we see in society. This was their scheme. It caused total damage to society. There were a few more such people in the annals of history.\nTruly, systems of caste or race did not cause harm, but they were made to look destructive. A knife does not harm one, but the one holding it can if he’s mentally unstable. A doctor’s knife bestows life. Poison is not harmful, the person using it is. The same poison saves life when given at the verge of death. There is nothing in this world inherently harmful. Evil-minded persons misusing objects are the ones harmful to society.\nOur teacher, Sri Bhagavad Ramanacharya Swami, observed these intricacies in the lifestyle taught by his predecessors. He postulated: “There is no need to abolish castes nor to bring reforms to ancient professions, nor to shun women.”\nThen what has to be abolished? The dogma attached to them. To get rid of this, rise above it. There is no need to abolish castes, but it is necessary to live at a higher standard. How can we do this? We can continue following our caste, traditions, customs, and duties. However, one should respect a person irrespective of caste. One should not be respected for his caste or profession; he should be respected for qualities defining his character. One is respected not because of birth, but because of knowledge. One should not be respected for his origin, but how he puts his learnings into practice.\nSo, what is that we actually need? What knowledge? What character? What practices? We should realize that we all are the progeny of the One Almighty. All beings are born out of one God. There is no doubt about this. Not only humans, be it animals, insects, microbes, etc. - everything is born from God. However, putting the animal kingdom aside, and concentrating on humans alone, remember, humans are all offspring of one God. They may differ in color, shape or their work - or their journeys, however we are all the product of God alone. Hence, we are all brethren in a family belonging to one God. When will we realize this fact? When we see beyond the body, recognizing the existence of a God in each and every one of us.\nVedas and Dharma Sastras (scriptures discussing righteous practices), accentuate this point. Itihasas (history) and Puranas (ancient tales) as well, manifested to teach this essential message. They all conclude with the same. What is it? The visible body - a soul within the body - God behind the soul. We, the souls, are all His children. He does not play favorites; everybody is equal in His eyes. He wishes for everyone’s well-being. However, because of their past deeds, there are changes in their bodies. It is similar to how one’s position, wealth, seat, etc. are based on one’s merit in education. One may not pursue higher education even when given a chance, so according to his capabilities, he might earn minimally and live simply only on that. One may make very good use of life and accordingly, he is awarded with good results, and material comforts so he can prosper. Because of such a fault with a soul, there is change in the bodies for each soul. Hence, the merits of bodies are different; we should accept bodies and the resulting duties accordingly. The very reason for a body is for this purpose.\nThus, one should accept and carefully follow laws of this birth in this body as a responsibility. It is like a job. As long as you are on it, follow the rules defined. However, when you are not working, you and I are the same in a social setting. In a cinema theatre, why should there be any reason for both of them to not sit together? When both are working, they work in their own areas and spaces. For the bread and butter of the body, each one exercises different sets of duties. Hence, one should follow his duty with as much quality and skill as possible. As long as one learns and puts these into practice, he deserves respect and encouragement. Facilities and necessary training should be provided. Chances must be given. This is our society. That is the reason why caste, creed, etc. exist.\nDo not mix caste, creed, work or profession into the equation. If opportunities and resources can be provided, let him take up his work. Professionally, everyone is doing different things. Otherwise, everyone is equal. Where is this scenario possible, only before God. Hence, before God, we are all equal. Everyone has the right to serve God. Everyone is eligible to serve Him. He accepts everyone equally. Hence, the happiness obtained is equal for everyone. He will not favor one above the other.\nvaishamya nairgrunye na said Vedavyasa explicitly in Brahmasutras (scripture). Bhagavan cannot be said to display favoritism and cruelty. Hence, we need to conserve social traditions with a clarified view of recognizing who we are. Because of this, Saint Ramanujacharya shared mantra (sacred utterance) with everybody despite whether they were harijan (people of God) or girijan (people of the mountains). Everyone is one progeny of God and everybody is related to Sri Vishnu.\njagame: vaishnavama:yam (The entire world is a Vaishnava). This is established.\nWhoever realizes this shares happiness with others and sorrows from others. This is how society lived until the 16th century. During the 15th and 16th century, when the British started ruling, they dismantled this system. Ever since we started looking only at bodily characteristics, difficulties rose among us. This created disparity, dominance, and disturbance across society that has continued to the present day. The politicians are still exploiting us based on this. Bhagavad Gita is about understanding this. It clarifies what these categories are, why they exist and how to live in relation to them. We are all equal in the eyes of God.\nArjuna questioned Sri Krishna if war might evoke disturbances in all social elements, and if he should really take part in such an act. Even if Arjuna wouldn’t fight, these disturbances were bound to happen because of the effect of Kali Yuga. Despite these forces, we need a protective shield that is Bhagavad Gita for society to withstand and thrive. Sri Krishna’s intention was to provide that shield, make Arjuna question ailments to society, and provide answers to these questions through Bhagavad Gita. Thus, these topics were brought up in Chapter 1 of Bhagavad Gita. Let us further delve into this.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "3. Main Content:\nJai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavad Bandhulara (Dear Devotees of God),\nBhagavad Gita is a message designed to benefit society as a whole. Anything hitham (beneficial) is always bitter. Anything priyam (favorable) is always tasty although not necessarily healthy. Hitham always gives good ‘health’ but may not be tasty. Bitter gourd is healthy but tastes bitter. It takes a little extra effort to accept and understand a beneficial message.\nIn the first chapter of Bhagavad Gita, while Arjuna was questioning Sri Krishna, he spoke about sankaryam (union of two people from different races). He says that kulas (birth based groups), and varnas (occupation based groups), should continue to exist. If there is war, they will be lost. Why should they exist? Because if people of each group following certain dharmas (righteous practices), are diluted or mixed up, society’s inherent strength weakens. Additionally, many women end up engaging in inter-group relationships - sankaryam. This is not kshemam (beneficial). When this happens, all the ancestors fall back to the earth from higher worlds.\nEveryone on earth belongs to a parampara (lineage). We have a mother and a father. The mother has a mother and a father. The father has a mother and a father and so on. We do not know when and how long ago all this began. All of them are jivas (souls). We are all jivas. This means that we have a body on the surface which will ultimately become a dead body. The one talking now is a jiva, also called an atma. This atma stays in this body for some time and then exits. In the same way, the souls of ancestors also have come and gone. They continue to do so because of karma. As long as they are executing karmas, rebirth continues. When karma is exhausted, it is known as moksha (liberation). As long as there is karma, souls keep roaming between patala loka (underworlds) and brahma loka (the highest celestial world). Departed souls are usually added into a category named pitras (ancestors) — regardless of age, gender, kula or varna. It means that they attain a state to live in that world - pitru loka. They move to a different world from pitru loka based on their karma.\nWhen they are in the pitru loka, they attain a body named aryama or pitru:deha:. That body also needs food. What kind of food is a different topic, but food is essential for that body too. How are those bodies fed? They are fed when their family members (here) make offerings to them, tarpanas (water offerings) and pinda pradanam (solid food offerings), by mentioning their name and gotra (lineage). Tarpanas are offerings of water through certain fingers in a prescribed manner on the ancestor's name at the advent of an eclipse, no moon day, anniversary, etc. Similarly, pinda pradanas are annual offerings on their name in the form of solid food. It is said that when the departed souls receive these offerings, they are happy and are able to travel to their next destination.\nThere are certain objections to this concept... “Can that person in the other world drink the water or eat the food that is offered here in this world?!” “First let a person living on an upper floor feed someone on the ground level. Then, we can think about how things reach other worlds!” “You can’t even feed someone who can be seen using this procedure, let alone those souls who are not seen.”\nLogically, these objections sound correct. It is not about whether something is seen or unseen because when there is a defined procedure to attain something, it is possible for it to be attained that way. How does it get implemented? Aren’t we seeing it nowadays? Aren’t you using electronic means via your phone to transfer money to other countries? Do you have to see the person to do it? Therefore, such aforesaid arguments are foolish.\nSastra (scripture) clearly states that tarpanas and pinda pradanas are effective. The energy used in the act reaches the target soul, not the object used. Just like a specific set of actions on a phone allows money transfer from one to another, a specific Vedic procedure allows the intended transfer to departed souls. You may wonder what happens if the departed soul takes yet another birth? The offerings will reach the new body of the departed soul as required food. Hence, they do not go to waste. You may question what happens if the departed soul attains liberation? Then, is the offering a waste? No. Why not? It is true that liberated souls have bodies that do not need these offerings. However, there are so many other departed souls whose families do not perform offering rituals. Those souls are niraharas (starving). Offerings then get utilized for them and are therefore useful. You may say, “Oh! Why should I do it for someone else?” You are not required to do this for anyone else.\nIn case of the departed ancestor attaining liberation, the corresponding offering will return to you multi-fold. If you send 10 to someone who isn’t reachable at a given address, and cannot be redirected to the actual address because he has attained liberation, it will then be redirected to you multifold as 100. You can at least do it for that sake. Thus, it is not a waste. The procedure and rules on how to offer and what to offer are defined. If you respect it, follow it. Otherwise, ignore it.\nIt is not right to criticize something without knowing it well. When you don’t know about something well enough, let’s not say it doesn’t exist, or isn’t of value, or isn’t scientific. What can ‘science’ talk about or what level of understanding do you have in these topics? How can we say something doesn’t exist because we don’t understand it?\nFor example, do you know that there is prana (life force), within you? Can we prove its existence scientifically? Can we use any instrument to see what is controlling the entire bodily system? No one has appropriately tried to discover such topics. Even if they tried, they have not managed to find out. How and why is prana giving energy to function even during sleep? Why is it working at times and stopping at other times? Even those who say it happens mechanically, do not understand why life stops functioning at different times. Prana does not leave at old age for everyone, some folks lose it in mid-age. We don’t understand or we do not have an instrument to prove what prana is, why it makes the body function, or why it stops functioning for someone. It is illogical to say prana doesn’t exist because we do not know about it. Instead, it is appropriate to say that we don’t know. It needs to be understood or investigated or researched to understand further.\nThe same is true for pinda prada:na:s, they have a purpose. At the least, through pinda pradana, you are also feeding birds, crows, cows or fish. It is a compassionate deed. It is not a waste to feed those animals contributing to our lives. Even if you do not believe in this Vedic procedure, it is still a useful act because it allows you to give back to one or more of the pancha bhutas (five elements of nature). It is definitely not a wrongful act. Thus, pinda-pradana is a practice that must prevail. If one does not perform this activity properly, families can face difficult dangerous situations, experience unexpected blockers in planned activities and unexpected outcomes even after every effort is made. When pinda pradana is performed properly as per scriptures, many types of obstacles will vanish and one can carry on with planned work, hassle-free.\nWhat’s the hesitation in performing the activity when there is no loss, easy, not harmful to others, and beneficial to nature? Is pinda pradhana worse than playing certain sports or producing bad movies? Hence the ritual of pinda pradana is required for society. It reflects the gratitude within you, being a human. Isn’t it your duty to remember and be thankful to your ancestors for being part of your birth and life? Pinda pradana is a process that gives us an opportunity to do something for our ancestors. It is a ritual to show your gratitude.\nVeda clearly says, in the case of a righteous spiritual ancestor, he does not need anything from his descendants. yadi ha:sya chavyam kurvanthi yadi cha na archisha me:vabhi sambhavanthi. He reaches God’s abode directly influenced with knowledge, without any concern for such offerings from any material-world family. Final rites or pinda pradana for such souls is not for them. They are for you as you are indebted to them. You are indebted to pancha bhutas because your bodies, their bodies, your life support system, and new bodies are all supported by the pancha bhutas. It’s therefore your responsibility to pay back to the pancha bhutas, not the responsibility of the panchabhutas or ancestors. Thus, perform tarpanas and pinda pradanas for paying your debt to the pancha bhutas. The offerings are to the bodies, not for the souls, which releases you from your debt.\nWhen the body is formed, we automatically enter into debt. We don’t know what the interest rate is for the principal, it could be simple or compound. You have received something, you are using it. Isn’t it your responsibility to pay back that debt? So if you want to clear the dues, you must perform these ancestral offerings. With material debt, one may get tension, BP, sugar etc, right? Clearing the debt relieves us from all such burdens.\nDon’t think that you are doing a favor to ancestors. Don’t worry about the purpose of the ritual if the ancestors are in the same world, different worlds, higher or lower, or have attained moksha, etc. There is no need for those kinds of questions. When an ancestral soul departs, the debt that your body accrued because of their body has to be paid. To clear that debt, it’s recommended to perform such prescribed offerings for some time, say for 40 years or for three generations. Perform these offerings without considering what they are getting. Instead utilize them to clear your own debt, bit-by-bit. However, we have now lost this practice and thereby, the debt clearing system as well. Thus, man ultimately becomes a loser.\nArjuna says in the first chapter.. pathanthi pitharo:hpye:shya:m luptha pindo:daka kriya:. There won’t be any ancestral offerings, thus both people here and in other worlds will suffer. The whole system gets broken down. Women begin crossing all limits. This is not good for society. The woman is a ‘supporting stem’ for society. She holds the husband, kids, and relatives together in a bond. They all revolve around her as a base. As long as the woman is stable, the family will do well. If she faces troubles or if she gets spoiled, the whole family will run into a disastrous state. For the welfare of the family, we need to protect a woman as carefully as we protect a flower. Parents protect her when she is a child, husband protects her in middle age and children protect her as she ages. Thus, if we take care of women carefully, all practices of griha (family), kula (caste), ja:thi (race), varna (group), samajika (social) and Vedic practices will follow and everyone will be happy.\nBhagavad Gita chapter one states there is a lot dependent on a woman. Arjuna said if war happens, we will experience these kinds of issues. Since similar events like war have taken place earlier, we already have such disturbances. Sri Krishna explains what needs to be done to get out of these and what to do to build a protective shield from them. This becomes Bhagavad Gita. Let’s learn how so as we move ahead.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "3. Main Content:\nJai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavad Bandhulara (Dear Devotees of God),\nThe first chapter in Bhagavad Gita is very important, containing many good topics. We cannot discuss all of them, but it is necessary to mention at least a few. Castes are not bad, color is not bad, race is not bad, women are not bad, nor are generational practices. If we preserve them, society will flourish as they encourage growth. If everyone preserves their own art/occupation and respects others’ as well, then society will be like heaven. I must worship mine, I must respect everything else. Do not hate others, or suppress them.\nHate and suppression - historically, these have been Western ideals. Whatever is theirs must prevail and that which is not theirs must be wiped out of this world. Nearly everyone’s instincts are like this, more or less, in the rest of the world. However, the Vedas prescribed a way of life to the world.\nsviya aradhana, sarva adarana (worship your own, respect all)\nAll must be embraced, nothing is to be hated. Do not disrespect or neglect that which is yours and passed onto you. Do not maintain indifference. Not only does it need to be protected, it should be carefully guarded, worshipped. Sri Rama worshipped his kingdom. Valmiki says, ramo rajyam upasitva, brahma lokam prayasyati. What does it mean to worship an empire? Isn’t it simply ruling? Ruling must not mean taking care of one’s own selfish interests, favoring a few and ignoring all others. Sri Rama administered the kingdom sincerely with as much care as one would worship a devata (deity). It is said that every ruler ought to be that way. Similarly, he should worship his dharma (set of practices), his work, caste, race, and color.\nNot everyone is on the same path. Each is uniquely qualified. Hence, respect everyone’s practices. Do your work, and let others do their own. When in a forest, you see an Ashvattha tree, an enormous banyan tree, a large holy fig plant, a plum tree, some hedges, bushes, and so on. Each one of them lives on its own, protects and propagates its own race, and follows its practices. They don't contend with, abhor or suppress each other. That is why the forest is so elegant, beautiful and joyful. Human race and society should prosper in the same way. People differ from each other in the color of their skin, practices, professions, structure and shape of the body, characteristics, and work styles. One should not inculcate hate or degrade others’ occupation. Everyone should live with dignity. For that to happen, we should make God the focal point and everything should be done as a service to God. When one performs a task as a service to God, that activity is termed kainkaryam (service). One must lead life as kainkaryam. Then, everything you do will be a good deed. One may clean the streets, another may clean the seepage, another may be a priest in a temple. Each one of those is a profession. Each of those people should worship their own profession. No one should feel jealous of the other or defame other occupations. Everyone should revere their own occupation as a service to God.\nSri Ramanujacharya bestowed us with this ideology and established an amazing system. However, this was ruined by the westerners. This established system was in place even during the Bharata war, between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Arjuna guessed that change would take place in the prevailing system after the Bharata war. Those changes came to pass. Probably, the rulers of that period were mostly Buddhists, who brought unwanted change into the system. It was then that Adi Shankaracharya started a great movement to re-establish Vedic dharma in society. Even Vedas were destroyed in the days prior to Adi Shankaracharya. When it became necessary to breathe new life into Vedic dharma, Adi Shankaracharya brought forth an amazing philosophy and set aside all other ideologies that were dominating the world until then. Through the Advaita precept, he re-established an excellent system where one can accept and practice Vedas. That was the extent to which he could do in his lifespan of 32 years. Afterwards, Ramanujacharya extended the Advaita precept to add Visishta with unique features and gave it perceptible form. He gave true meaning to the existence of the world and the life of every human being. He gave true meaning to God’s compassion. He institutionalized a beautiful process to access God’s mercy and offered it to the world. This system which Ramanuja established was followed until the 16th century, and was then destroyed. To revive it, we must recognize the path that was established by Bhagavad Ramanujacharya. That is what we are trying to do now.\nAs Arjuna was explaining to Sri Krishna about the dangerous consequences of war, all the above also came into discussion. This is not a myth. In the first chapter, Arjuna references these with Sri Krishna.\n\nSLOKA WORD - aho: batha! mahathpa:pam karthum vyavasitha: vayam | SLOKA MEANING - (Alas, what a great sin we are determined to commit!)\n“Hey Sri Krishna, we are about to commit a huge sin because of greed for kingdom and happiness. Is this appropriate? Is it proper to wage such a war?” Sri Krishna responded, “Will they sit idle just because you don’t want to? They would want to take revenge, wouldn't they?”\nArjuna retorted. “I will not take revenge, even if they want to.”\nSri Krishna challenged, “Do you think they will lay down their arms if you do not retaliate?”\nArjuna concluded, “I will not hold weapons, even if Kauravas choose to do so.”\nyadi mam aprati:karam asasthram sasthrapanayaha\nSri Krishna states, “They will not let you be.”\nArjuna replied, “If they want to hold weapons, let them.”\nSri Krishna reminded him:\nsasthrapanayaha dhartarashtrat (they will kill all of you)\nArjuna challenged:\nrane hanyuhu (let them kill)\nSri Krishna questioned, “Oh! Why so?”\nArjuna answered, “Did you know that if a warrior slays the unarmed in battle, those retreating, he will face vicious hell after death and the one killed will go to heaven?”\nSri Krishna responds “Yes, I know.”\nArjuna then says, “So let that happen. I won’t hold weapons, but they will attack me. I won’t seek revenge, but they will. Those seeking revenge on those who are not are destined for hell.”\nSri Krishna asks, “What about your fate then?”\nArjuna answers, “I will have done nothing, not waging war and opting for peace. I will go to heaven.”\nSri Krishna clarifies, “What a pitiful thought! You are neglecting your duties and hence, will experience extreme hell, not heaven. One who dies fighting for a righteous cause attains heaven. One unjustly waging war sees hell.”\n“One who kills others that are averse to their duties sees heaven. Those killed for being averse to their duties result in hell after death. Thus, you would see hell.”\nHowever, Arjuna didn’t think that way.\nasasthram sasthrapanayaha dha:rthara:shtra: rane: hanyuhu\nArjuna thought, “Even if they kill me when I am unarmed... rane: hanyuhu dha:rthara:shtra:ha that’s better for me.”\nHe says Kshemataram. Arjuna used a comparative degree here, kshematharam bhaveth. Kshemam (good), kshematharam (better), kshemathamam (best).\nArjuna says:\ntanme: kshematharam bhaveth\nWhat is kshemam in this case? Arjuna thinks kshemam is if both Kauravas and Pandavas go to heaven. They lose the battle and go to heaven. If we are alive after the battle, and win the kingdom, we will also go to heaven after death. Even if vice versa, both will go to heaven. Is it right if we both go to heaven? We led life in a righteous path, they led it in an unjust path. How is it fair for both of us to go to heaven? What about all the troubles we went through? Even though it is kshemam (good), if both of us go to heaven, I am not interested in that outcome.\nThen, what does he want?\nkshematharam (better): If we back off from the battle, and they kill all of us, then they will go to hell and I will go to heaven. Thus, it is better than kshemam. It is kshematharam.\ntanme: kshematharam bhaveth\nWhat he wants is that they go to hell, and he goes to heaven. Arjuna felt that if both go to heaven, that’s kshemam. He felt that whether they go to heaven or not, the Kauravas should not go to heaven. That is kshematharam for me. This shows the jealous side of Arjuna. He too, is arrogant and jealous. But he is relatively far better than others. He is a better devil, as we discussed. So, Sri Krishna wants to refine him and cleanse him.\nThere is a story. There were two merchants who had their shops across from each other. They had the same type of business in the same area, thus competing with each other. One fine day, one of the merchants closed his shop suddenly and went away. The second merchant started looking for him and found that the first one was doing penance in a forest. The second one became tense and felt that the first one might be doing penance to attain something bigger than what he currently had. He decided to do the same thing, sat directly across and started doing penance. They were both competing with each other. One fine day, God came to the second person and asked for his wish. Instead of making a wish, he enquired whether God had gone to the first merchant. If so, he was curious to know what the first person asked for. God said that He came to him first and asked him to make a wish. Then the second merchant requested God to go to the first merchant to ask for his wish and then come to him to grant double. God obliged. The first merchant also asked God to go back to the second merchant and grant him twice of whatever the second merchant wished. Then God, being compassionate, again went to the second merchant and informed him that the first merchant will get twice of what the second merchant wishes. The second merchant paused for a second and requested him to remove one of his eyes. So, what about the first merchant? He will lose both his eyes. He is not worried about losing an eye, but is happy that the other merchant will lose both eyes. This is kshematharam.\nIf both get equal share, it’s kshemam. If the other person suffers a loss twice of what he will suffer, that’s kshematharam. This is because of jealousy. Arjuna also had a similar kind of trait in him, that’s why he mentioned...\ndha:rthara:shtra: rane: hanyuhu\nIf we remain unarmed and if they come with weapons and kill us, we will go to heaven. Because they kill us despite being unarmed, they will go to hell. This is better for us.\nkshematharam bhaveth\nSri Krishna was surprised to hear this from Arjuna. Sanjaya marveled at the pitiful state they all had got into! Let us move further, finding out what else he was surprised with.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "3. Main Content:\nJai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavad Bandhus (Dear Devotees of God),\nBhagavad Gita is a wonderful scripture preaching essential messages to mankind. Not only for the present, or the past, the future as well. Bhagavad Gita is forever a handbook for mankind. For this mankind, struggling with ignorance, for this mankind, troubled by ego, for this mankind, plagued with all types of hatred towards each other, Bhagavad Gita is the guiding light. It is a beautiful, protective layer of wisdom. It is an elixir, a divine message, showing the path and leading to a better life. God bestowed this to us.\nWe are examining the prologue of this message in chapter 1. When Sri Krishna was delivering the divine message to Arjuna in the midst of the battleground on the first day of Margasirsha month, Sanjaya listened. Subsequently, on ekadasi, the eleventh day of that month, when Dhrutharashtra asked, Sanjaya explained it exactly as it happened. We may wonder if Sanjaya altered the conversation between God and Arjuna into slokas (verses) or if the conversation actually was in sloka-form. Perhaps people in those times conversed fluently in Sanskrit verses.\nSanjaya says to Dhrutharashtra, “Whatever they spoke, I heard it as is. It was absolutely joyful to listen.”\ntachcha samsmrutya samsmrutya (as I recall that conversation, even today, I feel thrilled with joy)\n“I have seen the divine viswarupa (God’s form displaying the entire universe), twelve days ago. However even today, I am able to see that form as clearly as that day.” “I am simply overjoyed.”\nSanjaya passed on this divine message to Dhrutharashtra. He provided us with the entire detailed conversation between Sri Krishna, Arjuna and others as it happened.\nIn chapter one sloka 47, Sanjaya summarized Arjuna’s situation and concludes the first chapter. What was Arjuna’s state?\n\nSLOKA WORD - evam uktva: arjunas-sankhye:, ratthopasttha upavisat visrujya sa-saram chapam, soka-samvigna-manasaha SLOKA MEANING - (Having said this, Arjuna, in the midst of the battlefield, sat down on the seat of the chariot, casting aside his bow and arrow, his mind agitated by grief.)\nevam uktva (Sri Krishna listened to Arjuna’s monologue). Arjuna listed all the losses that would be incurred if the war indeed took place - as if he knew everything and God didn’t know any of it. At times, we also do something similar. We go to our acharyas (spiritual teachers) and try to convince them as if we know more and they do not know anything. Here, Arjuna is doing the same. Does Sri Krishna need to be told by somebody else? He is the one who proclaimed that He, Himself, is the essence of all Vedas.\nvedaischa sarvaihi aham eva vedyaha (I am the only one to be known from all the Vedas)\nvedanta krut veda videva cha aham (I am the compiler of the Vedantas and I am the knower of the Vedas).\nHe said so. Does Arjuna need to tell anything to such an omnipotent God? No. However at times, even if we do that, God agrees with us. He either brushes it aside, or if there is merit and He likes it, He will make it useful to us in some or other fashion.\nArjuna expressed his sorrow. He described the unwanted destructive consequences of war. Even at this stage, he spoke in a way revealing his arrogance and jealousy.\ntan me kshema taram bhaveth yadi dhartarashtraha rane hanyuhu mam (It is better for me if all these Kauravas surround me and kill me while I'm unarmed.)\nWe see this in sloka 46.\ndhartarashtrah rane hanyuhu, tanme kshema taram bhaveth\nIt is ‘kshema-tharam’ for me, the comparative degree of kshemam (benefit). ‘Kshema-thamam’, the superlative degree of kshemam, is the best benefit, to directly attain moksha (liberation). ‘Kshema-tharam’ means Arjuna obtains better benefits than the Kauravas, implying that they should not receive the same benefits as him. Sanjaya says, “Oh King Dhrutharashtra! Arjuna is in this state of mind.”\nevam uktva (having said so)\nArjunaha sankhye (Arjuna, in that battlefield...)\n...what is he doing?\nratho:pasttha upa:visath’ - rathasya upastthe (he sat in the middle of his chariot and at once, became very sad)\nHaving done what?\nvisrujya sa-saram chapam - sa-saram chapam (the bow along with the arrow) visrujya (having dropped them). He threw them down. In principle, the bow and arrow are not to be thrown down at all. However, overcome with grief due to his avasadam and vishadam (deep sorrow), he just let his bow and arrow fall.\nsoka-samvigna-manasaha (shattered by a feeling of deep sorrow, he sat down with that state of mind)\nIn a chariot, the sarathi (driver), has a separate designated place in the front. Arjuna did not sit close to the driver. He moved towards the center of the chariot and sat down as if to declare – “I will not wage this war at all.”\nWhat a pity! Is now the time to feel this way? Everybody is ready to start the war. They are just waiting for you to fire arrows. They are eagerly waiting. If you sit down demotivated, they will undergo immense pain. So, you cannot be demoralized. You certainly have to wage war. If you take this step, you will not be at fault. If you take the other step, you will be flawed.\nIf a patient is on the operating table, under anesthesia and surgically opened up, at that point, if the surgeon says “Oh no! What is this I’m doing? All this bloodshed in surgery?” When is the doctor thinking this? When the patient is all set to be operated on the table. “I will not do this operation. This is just violence.” If he thinks like this, dropping all his instruments, he should be put in prison. Can he be considered a compassionate person? No! He will be considered an irresponsible doctor leaving the patient in a dangerous state.\nArjuna, having prepared for the war fully, is thinking that way! The Kauravas are all evil people, murderers. This war was in fact instigated by them. The Pandavas were always peace-mongers – like us Indians. They never wanted war. Just as India’s neighbors keep taking provoking actions, the Kauravas instigated this war. The Pandavas came to war as a result of that provocation. The Pandavas did not initiate the war by themselves. In the face of such a situation, Arjuna is overtaken by grief, forgetting his own responsibility! It is indeed his duty to face them. That is the obligation of a warrior. When the opponent crosses his limits, it is indeed one’s duty to push enemies back within their boundaries. If the opponent goes back without causing trouble, well and good. If that does not happen, what else can be done? The fault of initiating war does not lie with the Pandavas.\nYet, as if Arjuna is taking the responsibility for initiating war, he abandoned his dharma. In whose direct presence did he do this? The one who pledged - dharma samsthapana:rtthaya sambhavami (I will be born to establish righteousness) – the personification of dharma itself. Sri Krishna descended solely for the purpose of firmly establishing dharma. If Arjuna said these words to somebody else or left his dharma in front of someone else, we wouldn’t need to care much. However, he did this in the direct presence of God Himself, the personification of dharma, the one who descended to earth to establish dharma. To declare, “I am withdrawing from this war!” How surprising it is! Everybody is surprised.\nOf course, there is no element of surprise to Sri Krishna because He is the one causing these thoughts in Arjuna as Hrishikesa (controller of the senses). He created immense sorrow in the mind of Arjuna. That too, to a state where Arjuna said:\nsenayor ubhayor madhye rattham sthapaya (Position my chariot in the middle of both armies)\n“Position my chariot in the middle of both armies so that I can have a good look at the opponents. I will immediately decide whom I have to face in this battle.” Such a state he was in! However, after having a look at everyone, he began to see them as relatives instead of as opponents. He dropped the idea of waging war.\nThis is the essence of the chapter one Bhagavad Gita.\nevam ukthva arjunas-sankhye:, ratthopasttha upavisath visrujya sa-saram chapam, soka-samvigna-manasaha\nHis mind was disturbed with deep grief. It is the same situation for all of us as well. As humans, we lead our lives in the same state. We lack clarity on what activities are to be done, what activities to be avoided. When performing prohibited acts, or when we drop recommended activities, we get into a state of confusion and experience sorrow. When one experiences such a sorrowful state, sastras (Vedic scriptures) inspire us to perform our duty correctly.\nThe summary of Vedanta Sastra is not to make us inert or run away from carrying out our duties. It is to carve us into responsible, duty-bound individuals, leading our lives following our faith, letting others live in accordance to their faiths. This is explained in the first chapter, named ‘arjuna vishada yoga’.\nThe sorrow experienced by Arjuna opened the road for him to understand the essence of tattva (eternal truths). Thus, sorrow is essential for a person who seeks spiritual upliftment.\nLet’s recall - there are three people who experienced sorrow in this chapter. Dhrutharashtra, Duryodhana and Arjuna. However, Dhrutharashtra’s sorrow was tamasic (ignorant) in nature. Hence it is not regarded as pramanam (an appropriate means for knowledge). Duryodhana’s sorrow, which was rajasic (influenced by arrogance), is not recommended. Thus, we keep this aside as well. The sorrow experienced by Arjuna molded him to question God, made him want to listen to God’s message and ultimately surrender to God. So this sorrow is productive. Let us take help of Arjuna, who is sattvic (good) and learn the message given by God, follow our duties and get energized.\nThis brings us to the close of chapter one.\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Positive messages are easily absorbed when the medium is attractive to our heart. Knowing this, God took an avatara (incarnation) in an extremely beautiful form, Sri Krishna. We have heard about many avatharas of the Lord. We have even seen a few as archa murthi (deity form). However, the ethereal beauty of Sri Krishna is beyond words. Why did He come with such majestic beauty that stands firm in our hearts? The more firm His form is imprinted within our hearts, the better His upadesam (divine message) assimilates and fructifies into practice. This is why He descended with ethereal beauty. Letʼs visualize that beautiful form. How? Elders gave us a nice prayer to do so.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = kara kamala nidarsitha:thma mudraha | parikalitho:nnathabarhi barha chu:daha || ithara kara gruhi:tha ve:thra tho:thraha | mama hrudi sannidhim a:thano:thu sourihi ||\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = may He joyfully reside and shine in the lotus of my heart\n\nHow does He look?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = kara kamala nidarsitha:thma mudraha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = displaying atma mudra\n\nEarlier, we learned this posture is also known as jnana-mudra, because it imparts knowledge of eternal realities.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = kara kamala nidarsitha a:thma mudraha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = the posture explains the proper conduct of a soul, and hence, termed atma-mudra\n\nWhat is the inner meaning of this mudra? Scholars, acharyas, and Elders alike, keep their hand in this atma mudra posture. What is the secret behind this posture? Many people gave explanations according to their level of understanding, habits, or even their needs. There is no lack of explanations behind this mudra. Some people have the habit of sniffing nasal powder. Such people claim – as inhaling nasal powder gives great stimulation, this mudra stands for energizing the atma! This mudra sparks atma with lifeforce! This is their speculative explanation. However, this posture actually instructs, “learn how you should behave, being born as a human.” What does this mudra teach us? What state are we in now? We are in a body made of pancha-bhuthas (5 principal elements). However, the body drives our behavior with 3 different gunas (modes). They are satthvam, rajas, and thamas. At times, we feel sleepy, tired, and languished. There are three gunas (attributes), associated with prakruthi (nature). Of these 3, 'thamo-gunam' causes sleep, laziness, tiredness, and corrupts jnana (knowledge). These attributes are not physically visible to us. However, by observing the results in ourselves, we infer the causes. Thamo-gunam is one of the properties of prakruthi. At times, we display agitation, arrogance, restlessness, extremism, or boastfulness. The cause of such experiences is the impact of 'rajo-gunam' present in prakruthi. At other times, we feel unexplainable tranquility, bliss, a sense of understanding, comprehending everything we hear. Feeling as if “this is the correct way of life” - then we soon return back to our normal state. Tranquility, peace, and clear comprehension are caused by satthva gunam. These three causes – satthvam, rajas, thamas - are attributes of prakruthi (nature). Our body is composed of that prakruthi. Thus, our body also inherits these attributes. When natureʼs satthvam combines with our bodyʼs satthvam, its influence becomes enhanced. Similarly, when rajas in nature combines with our bodyʼs rajas, it displays greater influence on us. The same goes for thamo-gunam. At any given time, one of the three gunas is dominant, suppressing the other two. All three are never in a state of equilibrium. They are always fluctuating up and down like ocean waves.\nWe are in the midst of these three. We! “We” – indicates atma (the soul). This atma did not come here by choice. Nor is it functioning here as per its own wish. In the background, someone else is inspiring and enabling its functioning. That inspirational eternal entity is God, Paramatma. What is your role? You are not operating on your own will, my dear. You are working based on Godʼs inspiration as a driving force. Or you are functioning based on attraction towards external prakruthi. Prakruthi is not in your control. Whereas, Vedas declare that God is your benefactor. Thus, if you humbly bow your head before Him, He takes charge and ensures that prakruthi listens to you. Achieving this is the goal for human life. If not for this, God could have granted us another type of body - an animal, bird, insect, etc. Over and above those species, He gave a body that can utilize knowledge and strive towards that ever so important goal. He revealed that the primary responsibility and activity for humans is to surrender before God and to seek refuge in Him. This message is conveyed by jnana-mudra / atma-mudra / chin-mudra. In this posture, prakruthi is denoted by three fingers -middle, ring, pinky. Within these three fingers, the finger length represents the guna’s proportional impact. Most of the time, we are in a state of thamas (middle finger, longest). From birth to passing, regardless of duration - 1 / 10 / 25 years / 50 / 60 / 70 / 100 or 125 years… …the majority of this time is spent in sleep. Someone ignorantly said that half of our life is spent sleeping. Incorrect. Rather, approximately 80% goes towards sleep! It's excessive. Hence, sleep, and its root cause – thamo-gunam – is represented by the middle finger (longest). The adjacent finger, index, denotes us. It symbolizes atma. It is named tharjani (that which threatens). In this world, no other species threatens. They simply live on their own. If there is such a species which threatens, it is only us. Only us. Thus, we, atma is referred to as ‘tharjaniʼ and symbolized by the index finger. That is why we use the index finger to frighten others; we do not use other fingers to threaten. Hence, this index finger represents us. We are always next to ‘thamasʼ. Thamas predominates our being. If our thamasic nature were to ever decline, next comes rajo-gunam. Rajo-gunam brings ego, anger, a heightened sense of aggravation, etc. When sleeping, we donʼt know anything – as if we are Kumbhakarnaʼs senior brothers. However, when awake, we exhibit traits like provocation, anger, lust, etc. Rajo-gunamʼs magnitude is slightly less than thamo-gunam’s, just as the ring finger is slightly less than the middle. The last pinky finger signifies satthva gunam. This quality is the least in us. Hence, it is far from us (index to pinky finger)! Between the index and pinky (atma and satthva guna), there are middle and ring fingers (thamas and rajas). Only after them, there is the pinky finger, satthva guna. We all know how infrequently we experience good thoughts, a peaceful mind, controlled actions. etc. It is a very small percentage. 80% goes to sleep, about 18.5% goes for ego, selfishness, desires, etc. At the most, we are left with 1.5% for satthva. We have the least association with satthva guna, it barely touches us, just like the index and pinky. The middle and ring fingers (thamas and rajas) are right next to us, but, satthva is far and difficult to experience. Yet, we should strive to associate with that satthva guna. We came into prakruthi and reside in this body made from prakruthi. Whether we are realized, renounced, or anything else – we need to live within prakruthi as long as we are in this body. What to do then?\nThere is one more finger, ‘angushttha (thumb)ʼ, representing God. Veda says ‘angushtta ma:thraha purushaha'. The thumb, representing God, can be stretched very far from the index, ourselves. However, the thumb is most important. Whether middle, ring and pinky fingers are present or not, with only the thumb, we can accomplish all our tasks. If removed, we lose most of our abilities. That is why Dronacharya took Ekalavyaʼs thumb as told in Mahabharatha. The thumb is crucial, denoting paramatma (God). What should you do? You need to bow before God, connecting the index (atma) and thumb (paramatma). Submit yourself before God, then God moves towards you. When seeking refuge in God, even while in this prakruthi, He ensures prakruthi does not influence you. This is our activity, connecting the index and thumb, bowing before God. Renunciation does not mean leaving prakruthi. Realization does not mean isolating oneʼs self from prakruthi. We donʼt need to go far to the Himalayas as a result of realization. Wherever we go, all three gunas influence us. To be a prapanna, you should humbly bow and surrender to God while operating in and with the three gunas. This is our natural state. Having been blessed with a human body, realizing this is the primary goal. Any work undertaken with this mood automatically becomes worship to God. Thatʼs why this posture is named as ‘jnana'. It establishes the proper form of atma and streamlines the consciousness. Thus, it is named as chin mudra / atma mudra / jnana mudra. Lord displays this posture to us, “My dear, be like this.”\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = kara kamala nidarsitha a:thma mudrah\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = Along with this, He is also adorned with another enchanting decoration full of effulgence.\n\nLetʼs learn about that decoration in the next session. Jai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "Beauty captivates human beings. Other animals cannot comprehend physical beauty. It seems other animals can recognize objects but cannot appreciate beauty. For human beings, this is paramount. Hence, so many selections and tastes. What should a house look like? A room? Decorations? The house color? Floor color? Ceiling color? What should the facade look like? The external elevations? Even clothing. The style, color, design and how it drapes the person. Colors are applied to eyes, the face, even the hair. Like this, many sorts of embellishments! Ultimately, even with food. What colors should be in the food we eat?! How unfortunate. The urge to beautify has reached reckless levels, rearing its ugly head even replacing natural colors in food with artificial chemicals. What can one say about man?! Is this wise? It's wonderful to appreciate beauty, no doubt. However, to what extent? Should it stop at nature, whose beauty slowly and steadily transforms to a disgusting state? Or should it extend to appreciate the beauty of a jiva (soul), who uses nature and has been associated with it from time immemorial? Rather, should it reach Lordʼs beauty?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = thasmin garbhou dadha:mi\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = the root source of all souls and nature\n\nAt which level should we appreciate beauty? External beauty is not real beauty. Some things look beautiful today, but we donʼt know how they will transform tomorrow. In fact, one personʼs perception of beauty may not even appeal to the next person. What looks beautiful now may not provide the same pleasure some time later.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = vastu vastuva:tmakam kutaha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = asks Sage Parasara in Sri Vishnu Purana. The same object provides joy at times and causes sorrow at other times.\n\nThe same object inspiring joy for someone can simultaneously arouse sorrow, disappointment, and hate for someone else. No objects in nature are eternally stable and unchanging. Why? Because that is not natureʼs essential characteristic. Like ocean waves, all objects in nature are constantly churned, and hence, continuously transform. The only eternal, non-changing element, is the beauty of the Lord. If we can perceive Lordʼs beauty and keep it close to our heart… …then we will understand the proper state of things in this world and realize how to conduct ourselves appropriately. Sri Krishna's incarnation was intended to make us realize this. He gave us the elixir of Bhagavad Gita for this realization. Our Elders gave us a prayer to experience the beauty of Lordʼs divine form.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = karakamala nidarsitha:thma mudraha | parikalitho:nnatha barhi barha chu:daha || ithara kara gruhi:tha ve:thra tho:thraha | mama hrudhi sannidhim a:thano:thu sourihi ||\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = Sri Krishna who joyfully shines in the lotus of my heart.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = karakamala nidarsitha a:thma mudraha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = hand in jnana mudra (posture bestowing knowledge), indicating we have been given a human birth to accomplish this.\n\nHe says,”use it carefully!” This is perceived with knowledge, not by sight. We see only prakruthi (nature) with the physical eye, not the soul nor Lord. Practically speaking, we recognize the soul by the body it resides in. Based on the soul's innate nature, an effort to recognize Lord can be pursued. Oneʼs samskaras (karmic imprints), determine whether one makes a sincere effort or not. However, it is possible. To empower us to recognize Lord, Elders passed down various shastras (scriptures). Studying these scriptures and Eldersʼ good messages guides us to surrender to Lord, a state known as sharanagathi. If surrender is being resisted, all of Lordʼs efforts are in vain (like the thumb trying to reach an outstretched index tip). How much effort can the thumb alone exert to reach the index finger tip? Conversely, without the grace of Lord, no matter the effort, it will be futile (index trying to reach an outstretched thumb tip). However, with humility in us, He surely blesses us. Recognizing humility within us, He is ever-ready to bestow blessings. He then reveals how to work with nature appropriately. He allocated multiple chapters in Bhagavad Gita elaborating this concept, trying to give us valuable knowledge. Knowledge is like an eye. With open eyes, knowledge of the physical world is revealed - what, how and why - nearby objects are perceived. Even with objects present, if we keep our eyes closed, there is no benefit. Even with open eyes, and objects present, direct perception is not possible if there is darkness. So, with eyes kept close, there is no use. With open eyes in darkness, there is no use. Thus, the objects must be present, eyes should be open, and darkness should be removed for proper perception. The darkness between eyes and objects is analogous to ignorance. When we shed our ignorance, He will decorate His head with our eyes. He decorates His head with an eye. Which eye? A peacock eye. The tail of the peacock has feathers. Every peacock feather is considered an eye, known as ‘peacock eyeʼ. They are called barhi barha. Lord adorned barhi barha on His head. Why?\nIn reality, an eye is considered functional only when it recognizes the quintessence of philosophy. Otherwise, it is simply a peacock eye, a feather. Just as a peacock eye cannot be used to ‘seeʼ things, this eye [oneʼs knowledge] is not useful to comprehend reality if not surrendered to Him. This happens when oneʼs knowledge is not tuned to being humbly devoted to Him. That’s why God adorns His head, enhancing His beauty with those surrendered to Him.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = parikalitha: unnatha: barhi barha chu:daha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = chuda (His head is adorned with peacock feathers). In addition, He has given it the highest position.\n\nMeaning, He adorns His head with people who understand knowledge as revealed by jnana mudra and are surrendered to Him. He is ever accessible to those devotees that surrender to Him. Although the Lord controls the whole world, our scriptures reveal He is always compliant to the wishes of His sincere devotees. This is exemplified by the activities of His many avatharas. Like this, He adorns Elders as His headdress and adheres to their wishes. He obeys the demands of knowledgeable people. This is even observed during His incarnation as Sri Krishna. As Sri Krishna, He obeyed all the demands of gopikas, Akrura, and Vidura. He obeyed instructions of His elders and Father Nanda, who were instrumental in spreading His glory. There is no discrimination amongst His sincere devotees. As long as they are His surrendered devotees, He strives to fulfill their every demand. Letʼs take Arjuna as an example. All that Arjuna said was, “I am your disciple.” When Arjuna ordered their chariot to be positioned between both armies, Sri Krishna precisely followed the command. Obeying demands of His devotees is one of Lordʼs attributes. Thus...\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = parikalitha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = decorating His head with peacock feathers, He indicates that He will likewise adorn Himself with such devotees.\n\nHe blissfully enjoys this beautiful decoration. This is what He perceives as happiness! As if deprived for ages of these decorations, He shines like a bright light accepting devotees as His beautiful decoration! Meaning, He respects those who properly comprehend eternal truths. He listens to such people. However, there are others who do not follow His instructions. What does He do with them?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = ithara kara gruh:itha ve:thra tho:thraha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = for those not listening, He holds a whip in the other hand to bring them back on track.\n\nHe was serving Pandavas. However, to Kauravas, who opposed and made Pandavas suffer, He showed His hand holding that whip. He punishes those who trouble His devotees and always protects His devotees. He always bestows His devotees with proper knowledge. He incarnated for this very reason. To bless us with such knowledge, He gave an elixir par excellence, the king of scriptures, grandha raja, known as Bhagavad Gita.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = mama hrudhi sannidhim a:thano:thu sourihi\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = may that Lord make my heart as His abode and guide me eternally\n\nMeditating on Him, the epitome of beauty, and our eternal internal companion, letʼs move forward. Letʼs pray that the quintessence of His philosophy illuminates within us.\n\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "There is nothing God is unwilling to do in order to uplift mankind. Once, He incarnated as a fish. Once as a boar. Another time, as Narasimha (half man, half lion). Even a beggar. Once, as the angry Bhargava to slay evil. He is ready for anything, without hesitation for any task. God loves us more than a mother, who even cleans her childʼs excreta with care for his well-being. To benefit humanity, Lord did so many things, including eagerly coming to Earth as a charioteer to bless us with Bhagavad Gita. In fact, charioteering is considered a menial job, but He was willing to take this task as well. Charioteers are not like modern-day drivers, who sit in a comfortable front seat and nicely drive cars. Even horse-drawn carriages we see today are similar. We do not find many horse-drawn carriages these days, but the few we see are luxurious and fun. Even in such instances, their usage today is different from prior ages. However, in the battlefield, charioteering is not a simple, common task. Sri Krishna did not hesitate when Arjuna asked Him to be his charioteer in the battlefield. We pay respects to the charioteer guise revealing how affable Lord truly is.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = pa:thuna su:tha ve:shaha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = it’s painful for us to think about that He acted as charioteer\n\nThe warrior atop the chariot is not able to communicate verbally with the chariot driver... ...because that warrior must be alert, reacting to surrounding weapons, enemies, ammunition, etc. Yet, he must be able to give precise directions to the charioteer. Instead of verbal cues, he uses certain techniques to signal the charioteer driver. If the warrior kicks the charioteer on the left, itʼs a signal to steer the chariot to the left. If kicking him on the right, the chariot should steer to the right. When kicking the driver’s back, it signals the chariot to proceed forward. Following such a system, the warrior fights and charioteer drives the chariot. Sri Krishna, Lord himself, did not even hesitate to take the “menial” task of a charioteer, receiving the kicks of a man... ...solely for the intention of benefiting us. Desiring to bestow wisdom and mental strength, so that we may withstand enemies and evil forces all around. ...To come to us, He even became a charioteer, without any hesitation. Such daya (mercy), such saulabhya (affability)! Such sushilya (highly positioned yet sociable with anyone and everyone), such vatsalya (deep affection)! Intense affection for those who resort to Him is termed as ‘ashritha vatsalyaʼ. A step further, not simply affection, but Sri Krishna has intense love is unbelievably in love, ‘ashritha vyamohamʼ, for those who surrender to Him. He cares so much about these devotees that He is ready to do anything for them. As proclivity matures - that fondness ripens into affection, affection ripens into love, love to intense love…which then becomes deep adoration. That finally ripens into mystic rapture, vyamoham. The great scholar, Sri Pillai Lokacharya declared in Sri Vachana Bhushana that Lordʼs primary characteristic during Sri Krishna avathara is ‘ashritha vyamohamʼ. As Sri Rama, the essential characteristic quality He displayed was sushilya, affability with all kinds of people. As Sri Krishna, He showed intense admiration towards those declaring “tavasmi dasaha (I am yours, I belong to you)” by doing everything in whatever way He was asked to. He showers tremendous love. This is seen in Sri Krishna avathara as well. Draupadi took shelter of Sri Krishna. As a result, He gave the five Pandavas the gift of life. He destroyed all Kauravas and 18 akshauhini of battalions (millions of soldiers controlling chariots, elephants, and horses). Why? Because they all witnessed a woman’s humiliation. They watched and implicitly approved it. A few joined in and encouraged it. The rest, even when aware, did nothing or were indifferent. In reality, Pandavasʼ army was 7 akshouhini and Kauravasʼ army was 11 akshouhini, none of whom witnessed Draupadiʼs abasement. However, they made the mistake of joining Duryodhanaʼs side. Then, what mistake did those who took Pandavas side, commit? Although aware of Duryodhanaʼs actions, they remained passive and chose not to interfere. When one is aware of a sinful act yet avoids rectification, then that person is also held accountable. If he thinks, “Itʼs not my business, why should I react?”, then he also is liable. Not only the sinner and his entourage, but also ones who are privy without reaction or all together indifferent, will also be punished. Thus, everyone who took Pandavasʼ or Kauravasʼ side was punished. Immediately, a doubt arises. Even Pandavas watched the humiliation meted out to Draupadi. True. Just as Sri Krishna destroyed 18 akshouhini forces with pain and aggression, He would have destroyed Pandavas as well. Why did He spare them? Because Draupadi, for whose peace of mind He was willing to do all of this, would weep if she lost any of the five Pandavas.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = avaludaya mangalasutrathikka:ha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = her mangal sutra (sacred thread symbolizing her marriage), would be harmed.\n\nIntending to preserve Draupadiʼs sacred marriage, Sri Krishna carefully protected all five Pandavas. He eradicated the rest. This shows how much love Sri Krishna avathara has towards those who surrender to Him. The heart melts when we comprehend his saulabhya (approachability). Though Supreme, holding all worlds within and showing the entire universe from within Himself... ...He willfully received Arjunaʼs kicks as a charioteer. We can confidently declare that His mercy has no bounds. His nature is described in a beautiful prayer. Humbly bowing our heads reciting this prayer strengthens our faith in Him, and ultimately helps us realize His love and affection for all of us.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = agre: kruthva: kamapicharanam ja:nunaike:na thishtan | pascha:th pa:rtham pranaya sajusha: chakshusha: vi:kshama:naha || savye:tho:thram karasarasije: dakshine: jna:namudra:m | a:bhibhrano: ratthamadhivasan pa:thuna su:thave:shaha ||\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = may His divine form disguised as a charioteer protect us.\n\nWhere is He?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = ratthamadhivasan\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = where - sitting in a chariot How is He?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = dakshine: jna:namudra:m a:bhibhra:naha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = right hand with jnana mudra (indicating eternal knowledge) posture.\n\nWhat about His left hand?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = savye:tho:thram karasarasije:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = savye (in His left hand), karasije (holding a horse whip).\n\nWe discussed earlier, the whip is not for the horses, rather, for the armies of both sides. In fact, the whip is not needed. However, to fully adhere to a charioteer’s costume, to look complete... ...even in the guise of a charioteer, He wanted to be perfect. Thus, he wore everything that a charioteer needs. What is He doing?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = pa:rtham pranaya sajusha: chakshusha: vi:kshama:naha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = with eyes filled in love, He is blessing Arjuna.\n\nWhy? Even after explaining once, twice, thrice... Arjuna is still not understanding. When explaining a concept, Arjuna responds with various rebuttals and non-sequitur questions. Sri Krishna clearly instructs adherence to oneʼs responsibilities, yet, Arjuna wanted to leave everything and pursue self-awareness. When asked to pay attention to jnana (when performing karma), Arjuna rebuffs, \"Then why give a detailed explanation of karma at all?\" He was constantly quickly responding without fully understanding. Fine, can we assume Arjuna is ignorant? No. He is not. He speaks as if he is a highly intelligent person, claiming as if he knew...\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = pathanthi pitharo hyesha:m luptha pindo:daka kriya:ha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = if we fight in this battle, all the ancestral souls might fall to hell.\n\nThis reveals that our instinct is tricky. Though knowing nothing, we behave as if we know everything. That too, with half knowledge and speculation. We feel what we know must be the ultimate. Seeing this kind of mental state, God pities us. Thus, due to tremendous love, prioritizing whatʼs best for us, He reiterates the same messages over and over again.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = pranaya sajusha: chakshusha: vi:kshama:naha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = with eyes filled in love, He is blessing Arjuna.\n\nWhere is He sitting?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = agre: kruthva: kamapicharanam\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = reaching forward with one hand pulling the horsesʼ reins.\n\nWith the second hand...\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = ja:nunaike:na thishtan\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = sitting with one leg folded, resting His hand in jnana mudra on the knee.\n\nOne hand in jnana mudra, one leg folded, the other leg stretched downward... ...on the outstretched leg, He has anklets tied by His mother during His childhood. Alwars (realized poetic devotees), wanted to see these anklets as well!\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = kanaikazhal ka:nvadienhul kangale:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = great devotees desire to hear even the sound produced by His anklets while charioteering.\n\nThis is Bhagavanʼs divine, auspicious form. This describes His majestic appearance while preaching Gita for our benefit. Letʼs feel this in our heartʼs abode and strive to understand the eternal truths of Bhagavad Gita.\n\nJai Srimannarayana!\n\n\n\n================================================================================"

    "content": "The only tathvam (eternal truth) that has incarnated many times in various forms, associating with all kinds of people and can uplift everyone, is Narayana Thatthvam. In each instance, Narayana Thatthvam takes a different avatara (incarnation). For our understanding, our ancestors have described 10 forms in sequence. They are known as Dasavatharas. 1) Matsya 2) Kurma 3) Varaha 4) Narasimha 5) Vamana 6) Rama 7) Rama 8) Rama 9) Krishna 10) Kalki. They are referred to in different ways. Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimham, Vamana, Bhargava Rama, Dasaratha Rama… …some then say Sri Krishna, some accept Bala Rama, others accept Buddha, and finally Kalki as the 10th avatara. However, Srimad Bhagavatham mentions 22 avatharas. Again, the same scripture claims it's impossible to count the avatharas Lord has taken! In the 4th chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna says the same. How many qualities does Lord have? They are countless. They are endless.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = na:ntham guna:na:m gacchanthi\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = as there is no end to His qualities, He is known as Anantha (unlimited)\n\nIf each quality is illuminated by one avatara, He incarnates unlimited times displaying unlimited qualities. As per scholars, we may count stars in the sky, but itʼs impossible to count the number of Lordʼs avatharas. However, even learned scholars misunderstood the root cause of these avatharas. This has happened many times by those self-proclaimed staunch devotees. However, Veda established the root of all avatharas, Narayana Thatthvam. Vedas, agamas, and puranas detailed how Narayana Thatthvam has incarnated during certain periods in certain forms. Thus, the essence of Bhagavad Gita reveals Narayana Sharanagathi, taking shelter of Narayana. Bhagavad Gita reveals Narayana as the exclusive essential tathvam. Despite having read these entire texts, some still struggle immensely without recognizing Narayana Thatthvam. They claim to have not read 'Narayana Thatthvam' in the text. This is simply because the text was not revealed in proper fashion via a bona fide guru. Learning from a guru is essential. Though Vedas reveal many names of Lord, the root name for all is Narayana.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = na:ra:yan:ath bramha: jya:yateh:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = through Narayana alone, the forms responsible for universal srushti (creation), sthithi (sustenance), and layam (recycling) have emanated\n\nHow does one recognize Narayana? Again, we refer to Veda. Only Veda reveals proper recognition. He resides within us. He resides within every object in nature. He is the indweller and supporter of all objects in the solar system, including the Sun. It seems, He also resides in Palakadaali (The Milky Ocean), and Paramapadam (the eternal abode). Whether we can or will recognize Him there is questionable, but, we can see Him directly within Surya Bhagavanʼs (the Sunʼs) divine form. For all the solar planets, the essential support is the Sun. The supporter of that Sun and this entire solar system is Narayana Thatthvam. Thus…\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = dhye:yas sada: savithru mandala madhyavarthi na:ra:yana\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = the same Narayana Thatthvam is inside the Sun, referred to as ‘Surya Narayanaʼ\n\nSo, how do we recognize this tathvam? There must be some external identification. What kind of identification? The same Veda reveals… …take refuge of the solar antharvarthi (indweller), Narayana himself (within the Sun). Veda recommends picturing His beautiful eyes and taking shelter. In Chandogya Upanishad, at the center of the Sun, Narayana is referred to as ‘kapyasam pundarikam evam akshini'.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = ye esho:ntara:dithyehi hiranma:ya purushaha hiranyas smisruhu hiranya nakhaha a:pranakha: a:th sarva e:va suvarnaha…. …thasya yadha: kapya:sam pundari:kam e:vam akshini\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = He has 2 eyes. No more or less. Only 2 eyes.\n\nWhat do these eyes look like?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = kapya:sam pundari:kam\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = Pundarikaksha is established!\n\nBhagavad Ramanujacharya Swamy became guru to the entire world revealing the meaning of Pundarikaksha. We will learn about the meaning of Pundarikaksha later. In essence, Veda states that Pundarikaksha is the solar indweller and only through the quality of pundarikakshatvam can one recognize this tathvam, the highest truth. In Bharatham, when performing Rajasuya Yagam, Dharmaraja invites participation from kings across the world. There are kings of all ages - old, young and middle aged. Who should the agra puja (initiating prayers), be offered to? When starting any work, we pray to Elders and then start. Dharmaraja was unsure, “To whom should we offer the initial prayers?” For clarification, he asks Bhishma, “oh Grandfather, whom should we initially meditate upon first for a successful yagam?” Bhishma did not directly answer. First, he established the nature of the quintessential truth and explained how to identify it. Only then, he leads Dharmaraja towards the para-tathvam (highest truth), eligible for prayers. However, Bhishma needs to explain in such a way that Dharmaraja does not feel that itʼs impossible to find that para-tathvam… …and establish the accessibility of para-tathvam amongst them. Only then, must he reveal it is Sri Krishna. In order to show this, Bhishma first explains about that tathvam, establishing Narayana as eternal. When He arrives in Palakadaali, that tathvam performs srushti (creation), sthithi (protection), and layam (destruction). From there, all avatharas advent. After all this, if Dharmaraja asks where to find that tathvam... Bhishma reveals whatʼs already familiar - the glowing, beautiful eyes of Lord. Clarifying where to find that tathvam, Bhishma says to Dharmaraja…\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = sa e:shaprudhu dhi:rgha:kshaha sambandhi: the: jana:rdhanaha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = see your own relative, Sri Krishna\n\nThe one with Pundarikakshtvam, having lotus-like eyes, is eligible for the starting prayers. Look for yourself. Who knows? Sometimes these eyes cannot comprehend properly. Often, without someone explicitly pointing out the truth, we cannot properly recognize it. Uncertain of Pandavas discerning ability, Bhishma made it clear.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = sa e:shaprudhu dhi:rgha:ksha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = that para-tathvam, descending from Vaikuntam, known as Sriyahpathi, Sriman Narayana. He is the same one.\n\nWho?\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = sambandhi: the:\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = your brother-in-law, He himself.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = jana:rdhanaha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = the one punishing evil and protecting righteousness, your relative, Sri Krishna\n\nBhishma makes this very clear, and recommends initial prayers be offered to Sri Krishna. We know the history. Sisupala objects. Sri Krishna beheads him and ultimately accepts the agra puja. The supreme Narayana is established by the one with Pundarikakshatvam. That Narayana incarnates as Sri Krishna. Innocently, some people establish Sri Krishna as para-tathvam and that from Sri Krishna all Narayana avatharas originate. However, tathvam clearly states that the avathara possessing Pundarikaksha, lotus-like eyes, originating from Narayana, is Sri Krishna avatharam.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = krushnam kamala pahtra:ksham\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = hearing about Him, all sins are burnt and virtues are relished.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = punya sravana ki:rthanam\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = simply hearing His instructions, all our sins are removed.\n\nWho is he? The omnipresent, Vasudeva.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = va:sana:th va:sude:vasya\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = as He is omnipresent, He is known as Vasudeva, also because He is the son of Vasudeva.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = va:sude:vam jagad yo:nim\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = the root cause of the entire universe.\n\nWho? Sri Krishna? The same one we know. Sri Krishna is an avatara.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = naumi na:ra:yanam harim\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = He is the incarnation of Narayana Himself.\n\nThe most extraordinary, untamperable, and flawless of all his names, is Narayana.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = naumi na:ra:yanam harim\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = that Narayana destroys all kinds of sinful defects within us. Thus, He is called Hari.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = harir harathi pa:pa:ni dushta chitthair api smruthaha\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = as long as one seeks Hari, even one with negative intentions, is purified of all negativity and trained to become the best among all.\n\nThus, lordʼs name is Hari, the one who destroys all sins. He is Narayana, dwelling in and around all moving and non-moving objects. He is Yoni, the root cause of this entire universe. He is Vasudeva, omnipresent. Simply hearing His name is enough. Any flaw is remedied. This is the prayer our Elders offered. Letʼs offer the same.\n\nSANSKRIT WORD = krushnam kamala pathra:ksham, punya sravana ki:rthanam | va:sude:vam jagad yo:nim, naumi na:ra:yanam harim ||\nSANSKRIT WORD MEANING = We bow to Krishna, whose eyes are like lotus petals, whose glories and name purify those who hear them. He is the omnipresent Vasudeva, the origin of the universe, and a form of Hari-Narayana.\n\nJai Srimannarayana!"
