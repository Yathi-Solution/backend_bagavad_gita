Bhagavad Gita is called sastra (authoritative scripture). The pushpika (concluding words) of each chapter states:\nithi sri:mad bhagavad gi:tha:su upanishathsu bramha vidya:ya:m yo:ga sa:sthre: (Thus, in the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishad, the science of Brahman, the scripture of yoga)\nSastra (authoritative scripture) is that which enjoins, revealing the knowledge that is beyond what one can learn through senses or through imagination. That is called sastra (authoritative scripture). Bhagavad Gita is also a sastra (authoritative scripture).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ngi:tha: sa:sthram idam punyam yah patte:th prayathah puma:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever diligently studies this sacred scripture of the Gita, that person... (This is an incomplete phrase from the original text, implying a positive outcome for such a person).\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe Wise have all respected and worshiped Bhagavad Gita as a sastra (authoritative scripture). Bhagavad Gita elucidates the essence of all Upanishadic teachings. Bhagavad Gita is an upadesa (edification/teaching) given to Arjuna by Sri Krishna. Relieving Arjuna from the queries/questions he had, Sri Krishna bestowed the teaching in a way that it became a means for uplifting all humankind.\nIt is said that Chapter 2 is its essence, holistically. Bhagavad Gita has 18 chapters. Chapter 1 is the preface that reveals Arjuna’s sorrow. Chapter 2 is where Sri Krishna’s upadesa (teaching) begins. Chapter 2 is the root of the entire Bhagavad Gita. If one understands Chapter 2, it can be assumed that one understood the entire Bhagavad Gita holistically. As discussed earlier, the remaining 16 chapters of the scripture elaborate on certain aspects of Chapter 2.\nIt is said that the great Yamunacharya Swami himself is the acharya (spiritual teacher) of Ramanujacharya Swami. He graced the world in the 10th century and the early part of the 11th century. Yamunacharya Swami directed five of his disciples to bestow Ramanujacharya Swami with knowledge of five different topics. During Ramanujacharya’s lifetime, each one of them blessed him with the knowledge of each topic. Among them, there is a world-famous historic episode where Ramanujacharya gave away the mantra from a monumental temple tower top. Before doing that, he approached a guru named Goshtipurna to seek the meaning of charama sloka (the ultimate verse from Bhagavad Gita). That guru is also called Thirukko:ttiyur Nambi. In fact, Mahapurna, also known as Periya Nambi, is the one who introduced Ramanuja to Goshtipurna. Mahapurna is the one who gave pancha samskara (the five qualifications at initiation) to Ramanujacharya. He was the great one who taught him the mantra. He was the one who gave him a proper understanding of sampradaya (set of recommended Vedic practices). Sri Mahapurna gave his entire life for Ramanujacharya. He was the second acharya (spiritual teacher).\nWhen Ramanujacharya visited Thirumala, a great acharya (spiritual teacher) named Thirumala Nambi, or Sri Sailapurna, taught him many secrets of Sri Ramayana in a series of 18 discourses. There is another acharya (spiritual teacher) named Maladhararya. He is also known by a sampradayic (traditional) name, Thirumalai Andan. He was the great acharya (spiritual teacher) who taught the summary of Nammalwar’s Thiruvaimozhi. Along with him there, an Arayar Swami taught him Divya Prabandhas. These are the five acharyas (spiritual teachers).\nHowever, the great Yamunacharya is the one above all the five acharyas (spiritual teachers). He saw Ramanujacharya only from a distance as there was no opportunity to come face to face. Ramanujacharya’s desire to pay obeisances to Yamunacharya Swami took shape. He then traveled to Sri Rangam from Kanchipuram, but by then Yamunacharya Swami had shed the physical body. Thus, they didn’t meet in person. However, as per his instructions and intention, Ramanujacharya learned the five topics from the five acharyas (spiritual teachers). Later, he was able to widen the horizons of the sampradaya (set of recommended Vedic practices). Ramanujacharya felt that he could rise to the level he did only because of the impact of the upadesas (teachings) by Yamunacharya Swami. All the Wise also accepted the same.\nYamunacharya Swami is a great jnani (knowledgeable one). He gave an upadesa (teaching) on the summary of Bhagavad Gita in a very beautiful and lucid manner. It is called Githartha Sangraha (Summary of the Bhagavad Gita's meaning). In that, he explains the essence of the entire Bhagavad Gita through single verses. There are 3 shatkas (sets of 6 chapters) in Bhagavad Gita, a total of 18 chapters. What is the essence of the first shatka (set of 6 chapters)? What is the essence of the second shatka (set of 6 chapters)? What is the essence of the third shatka (set of 6 chapters)? He explains in one verse each. Later, he explains the essence of each chapter in one verse each, i.e., 18 verses. He adds a few more verses to clarify certain aspects. This scripture is called Githardha Sangraham. This is also one of the primary scriptures composed by Yamunacharya Swami.\nIn it, when explaining the essence of the entire Bhagavad Gita, that all-pervading tattva (truth/principle) which keeps all the universes within it is called Narayana as stated by the Vedas. He declared the goal of Bhagavad Gita is to glorify His svarupa (form/nature).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna:ra:yanaha parambramha gi:tha sa:sthre: sami:rithaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNarayana, the Supreme Brahman, is declared in the scripture of the Gita.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHow can one attain that Narayana? This is the question we generally have. He answered it beautifully in one line.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nswadharma jna:na vaira:gya sa:dhya bhakthyai:ka go:charaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe is attainable only through sadhya bhakti (devotion attained through grace), which is achieved through svadharma (one's own duty), jnana (knowledge), and vairagyam (detachment).\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf one wants to perceive Narayana, it is possible only through bhakti (devotion). The love one has towards God is called bhakti (devotion). He can be attained only through bhakti (devotion). How is bhakti (devotion) attained? What kind of bhakti (devotion) is it? It is called sadhya bhakti (devotion attained through grace). Bhakti (devotion) is of two types. One is that which is obtained through different kinds of effort. Another is that which is graced by God Himself because of causeless mercy. The love for the Lord given by Him alone is called sadhya bhakti (devotion attained through grace). That which one attains through various kinds of means and efforts is called sadhana bhakti (devotion attained through effort).\nLove for the Lord is not something we can earn or attain to bring God to us. It is something that can be attained only when He gives it to us. The Sun does not appear for us when we want. When he wants to appear for us, no one can stop him. When we want to see him, we can only see him when he appears for us. Similarly for God. Whomever He chooses to grace, He will be attained only by them.\nsa:dhya bhakthi e:ka go:charaha (He is attainable only through sadhya bhakti)\nWho does God grace that sadhya bhakti (devotion attained through grace) to? Can He not grace that to everyone if it is anyway causeless? If it is being graced without any reasons, can He not bless everyone with it all at once?\ne:k dam karishye (all at once)\nYes, He can. However, He doesn’t do that. Why? Because there is naturally existing knowledge in each of the souls. One begins to put that knowledge into work. What work? The work is to not block [the grace of God]. That is enough. Only to state that he is not blocking [God’s grace], he needs to qualify whatever activities he does. What all are they?\nFirst one is svadharma (one's own duty). Whatever is assigned to him, doing those activities with a feeling that they are assigned by Veda, not being arrogant thinking that he is the doer, and doing them as a service to God, then the same activities we do become dharma (righteous conduct/duty). Svadharma (one's own duty)! If one can lead life this way, the result is knowledge relating to God. As much as that knowledge grows, the interest towards everything other than God decreases by the same amount.\nparama:thmani yo:rakthaha virakthaha aparama:thmani (one who is attached to the Supreme Soul is detached from others)\nWhen a longer line is drawn next to an already existing line, it automatically ‘becomes’ shorter. Similarly, as the knowledge of God grows, the knowledge and interest levels of others go down. When the interest towards other things goes down, it is viraga (detachment), known as vairagyam (detachment). Whoever has these, i.e., whoever has put in effort to cross hurdles to get there, as He said:\npre:kshye: kancthith kada:chana (whenever I wish, I will grace someone among them)\nWhomever He graces thus, sadhya bhakti (devotion attained through grace) rises in that one. That enables one to realize the tattva (truth/principle).\nna:ra:yanaha param bramha (Narayana is the Supreme Brahman)\nThis is the comprehensive essence of Bhagavad Gita. This is what is revealed in verse 18.66. Whoever seeks my refuge...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naham thva: sarva pa:pe:bhyo: mo:ksha ishya:mi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI shall liberate you from all sins.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe clarified and declared this. This is the essential core of Bhagavad Gita. One [Sri Krishna] is the giver. The other [Arjuna] is the recipient. There is an underlying process for it. To elaborate these, Bhagavad Gita has come to light in the form of these three grand shatkas (sets of 6 chapters). Let’s move ahead understanding what the three shatkas (sets of 6 chapters) are.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nTo research or learn Bhagavad Gita, if one can get a feel for its comprehensive form, observe what is described in each section, and then enter it, one can then clearly understand it. Ramanujacharya’s acharya Yamuna muni or Yamunacharya, also known as Alavandar, taught it in such a manner in Gitartha Sangraha (summary of the meaning of Gita).\nBhagavad Gita consists of 18 chapters, right? It is divided into three shatkas (sections of six chapters each). What is the summary of the first shatka? What is the summary of the second shatka? What is the summary of the third shatka? He explained all that wonderfully.\nThe first shatka consists of the first 6 chapters of the scripture. It is named atma shatkam (section on the soul), which elucidates the nature of the soul. To explain the nature of the soul, the body in which it resides also must be explained about. What is the soul? What does it do when it dwells in the body? How does it work? This is what He explains. If it knows and works accordingly, what happens to it? If the soul, when in a body, can accomplish what it needs to, it will then become free from karma (actions) which binds it to a body. The first 6 chapters of the scripture have emerged to explain this. Therefore, it is named atma shatkam.\nThe second shatkam, chapter 7 to chapter 12, is named bhakti shatkam (section on devotion), giving knowledge of devotion for God. To learn what love for the Lord is, we must know who God is. Are we God or is God different from us? We must know this because some believe that they are God and they declare it too. That’s okay. When looked at from one angle, that can make sense in a way. However, it is okay only when such statements are made knowing about how it is so. If one makes such statements with no clarity about it, people laugh at them. People will make fun of such a person. What does God look like? What are the things He can do? What is the love we must have for Him like? To get that love, does He exist everywhere? What does He do? How does He govern all that? Is He accessible to all? We must know all these, right? All these aspects are part of knowing about love for God. To explain these aspects, the second six chapters of the scripture have come through. It is the second shatkam, named bhakti shatkam.\nThere are another 6 chapters. Chapter 13 to Chapter 18. Arjuna heard everything but did not pay proper attention until He saw God’s viswarupa (Universal form). It is in the 11th chapter that God showed him viswarupa. After that, he started to listen attentively. However, by then He had already revealed all that needs to be. Our Arjuna started paying attention now. Hence, He felt it would be beneficial to recap everything. Whatever He explained earlier, He explained that vishaya (topic) in different ways from chapter 13 till chapter 18. Therefore, it is named purva sesha (recap), purva sesha shatka (recap section). It is the part that explains what had already been taught in a way that it settles in the heart properly. In all, it is 18 chapters.\nYamunacharya Swami explained these three shatkas in three verses. After doing that, he started with the first chapter. He first split it [Bhagavad Gita] into 6 chapters each. Now, he goes by chapters. It is 18 chapters, right? He gives one summarizing verse for each chapter. The first verse explains what’s to be learnt from the first chapter.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the entire world.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nasttha:na sne:ha ka:runya dharma:dharma dhiya:kulam\npa:rtham prapannam uddhisya sa:sthra:vatharanam krutham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe scripture (Bhagavad Gita) was revealed for Partha (Arjuna), who was confused by misplaced affection, compassion, and understanding of right and wrong, and who had surrendered.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBhagavad Gita is a shastra (authoritative scripture). Its appearance is nothing but God’s teaching. What is the reason for this?\nasthana sneha karunya dharmadharma dhiya akulam (confused by misplaced affection, compassion, and understanding of right and wrong)\nPoor Arjuna got worried. What was bothering him? He felt love where he shouldn’t. It is good to feel love but where and towards whom? If the other person is causing harm to him, he shouldn’t feel love for him. He should protect himself or stop him or send him out. He should do something of that sort. Everyone, including Arjuna, reached the battlefield and are ready to fight in the war. The entire stage is set for the war. It is his duty now to fight but he felt attachment to the people on the other side. This is wrong. Being attached, he felt sad that the arrows would hurt them. He thought about how they would lose life, their relatives would all be in sorrow. He felt karuna (compassion). With that…\ndharmadharma dhiya akulam (confused by right and wrong)\nHe felt dharma (a righteous act) is adharma (unrighteous); and adharma (unrighteous) is dharma (righteous). What is the duty of a ruler? It is to curtail the wrong-doers and encourage the people doing the right things. Kauravas are doing the wrong things. They are doing many misdeeds like poisoning them, burning their home, taking another’s wife away. Not one, they have committed all the misdeeds there can be! A ruler must punish such people. He must put them on the right track. He is not allowed to forgive them thinking that they also are his people. He felt love for them. They are all my…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:cha:rya:h pitharaha puthra:h thatthaiva cha\npitha:mahaha e:than nahanthu miccha:mi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTeachers, fathers, sons, and also grandfathers – I do not wish to kill them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDharma (righteous duty) felt like adharma (unrighteous action). His duty is to rule the kingdom and perform the related activities. Instead, he wanted to beg and survive.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsre:yo: bho:kthum bhyksham api iha lo:ke\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is better to live by begging in this world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf one with a responsibility to rule wants to simply beg for living, who will carry out his responsibility? Therefore, he felt whatever was adharma (that which should not be done), as something that he should be doing. He felt compassion for those who should be punished. Whatever his duty was, he felt that it wasn’t the right thing to do. That caused a lot of distress in the mind and he felt sad. He became akula (confused).\nprapannam uddhisya (aiming at the surrendered one)\nEven earlier, Krishna was with Arjuna during the 12 years exile in forests and 1 year incognito. Back then, Arjuna and the rest never felt like asking Krishna what was the right thing for them to do. Now, Arjuna felt like it. That is why, in the beginning of chapter 2…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka:rpanya do:sho:pahatha svabha:vaha\npruccha:mi thva:m dharma sammu:dda che:tha:ha |\nyachchre:yas sya:n nischitham bru:hi thanme:\nsishyas the:ham sa:dhi ma:m thva:m prapannam ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nMy nature is overcome by the flaw of pity; my mind is confused about duty. I ask You, tell me decisively what is best for me. I am Your disciple, instruct me who has surrendered to You.\n-----------------------------------------------\nI surrender to You. I am Your disciple. I am related to You. Hence, You decide and clearly tell me what is the right thing to do for me so that I am not in dilemma or distress again. I am ready for it. Also, I am explicitly asking You for it. After so long, he got the wisdom for it. Because he asked for it, because he stated that he is His disciple, and because he reached the state of a prapanna (surrendered one), it is right to teach him.\npartham prapannam uddhisya shastravataranam krutam (the scripture was revealed for Partha (Arjuna), who had surrendered)\nHe brought out the entire Bhagavad Gita shastra (authoritative scripture) for him. This is the summary of chapter 1. Giving the summary of the entire chapter in 1 verse! This is the greatness of the talent in Yamunacharya Swami.\nComing to chapter 2, what does it say? We have heard 72 verses in it. What is its summary? Can we give the vishaya suchika (an index of topics), giving what it is all about? Yamunacharya Swami did that.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnithya:thma asanga karme:ha go:chara: sa:nkhya yo:ga dhi:hi\ndvithi:ye: sthithadhi: laksha: pro:ktha: than mo:ha sa:nthaye:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn the second chapter, for the calming of his delusion, the characteristics of a steady mind, the eternal soul, and action without attachment, which are the subjects of Sankhya and Yoga, were taught.\n-----------------------------------------------\ntan moha shantaye (for the calming of his delusion)\nArjuna was in moha (delusion), not knowing what he was doing. To relieve him from that,\nprokta (it was taught)\nIt reached the world through Sri Krishna. It was taught. What was taught?\ndvitiye sthitadhi laksha prokta (in the second chapter, the characteristics of a steady mind were taught)\nsthitadhi (steady mind)\nHow should someone with sthitaprajna (a firm and stable mind) be? What are the qualities of such a person? He said that these are taught in Chapter 2. He didn’t jump into that topic directly. What did He say prior to this?\nnityatma (eternal soul)\nHe taught about the eternal nature of souls. When the eternal nature of souls is explained, then the transient nature of the body is clear automatically. Soul is eternal. That clarifies that the body is not. There are only two. One is the body, and the other is something that is indwelling called jiva (individual soul), or atma (soul). Because it exists within, the body is functional. What is that which is indwelling? We don’t have any clarity on it and it is not visible in any way. There are many people trying to use various instruments till date. It is being researched with an intention to manipulate it for their benefit in some way. However, it is not something anyone can see. Therefore, it was necessary to explain about it. He clarified that it is eternal.\nnityatma (eternal soul)\nWhat must you do when in this [body]?\nasanga karma iha (action without attachment here)\nYou must work. When you are in the body and doing any activity, it is called karma (action). You must do those activities with an attitude that it is not something happening because of you… and that the results of it are not just for you.\nasanga karma (action without attachment)\nOne must have such a desire.\niha (here)\nThen, he will realise…\nSankhya yoga dhihi (knowledge of Sankhya and Yoga)\nSankhya (knowledge of the soul) means atma (soul), Yoga (action) means karma (action). One must attain clear knowledge of the two. If he has such clarity in knowledge, he will be able to become a sthitaprajna (person with a steady mind). Saying so, Krishna clarified the qualities of a sthitaprajna. In this verse, Yamunacharya Swami taught the summary of the 72 verses chapter of the scripture. Let us get further insight into that verse. We will then enter chapter 3.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

What is it? The chapter has 72 verses in total. The first 11 verses, along with the entire previous chapter, Chapter 1, have come about only to describe Arjuna’s sorrow. The rest followed from verse 12 onwards. Therefore, approximately 61 verses of scripture compose Chapter 2. What is the established subject in them?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnithya:thma: asanga karme:ha go:chara: sa:nkhya yo:ga dhi:hi\ndvithi:ye: stthithadhi: laksha: pro:ktha: thun mo:ha sa:nthaye:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn the second chapter, the eternal nature of the soul, the desire for action without attachment, and the characteristics of a person of steady wisdom are explained to remove ignorance.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYamunacharya Swami teaches it in the scripture known as Gita:rttha Sangraham (Summary of the Meaning of the Gita). What does it say? Firstly, `nithya:thma` (the soul is imperishable). `De:ha` (the body) is perishable. Krishna had to show Arjuna the difference between the two. An army of Kauravas and others stood across from him. If he fights in the battle, is it the body or the soul that’s going to get hurt? Arjuna had to learn about this. He must know that the soul doesn’t get destroyed. He must know that the bodies get destroyed. When it’s your relative’s bodies going through destruction, it’s difficult to face. Isn’t it? Even if whatever they are doing is harmful to society. The soul is indestructible despite being in the body. Yet, if the work being done through the body is harming the world, then it is `dharma` (righteous practice) to stop that from happening. Therefore, you must wage war. Just because you are fighting the war, the indwelling soul does not get destroyed. In the case of the body, it will not be alive forever despite any efforts. It will be shed today or tomorrow. He had to explain these qualities to Arjuna in a way to have them engraved in the heart. This took approximately 17 verses. Beginning with the 12th verse and through the 30th, He clarified this using different logics and reasonings. He explained both the eternity of the soul and the transience of the body. Therefore, there is no need to worry about these. You can certainly wage war with no hesitation. Even if you don’t believe that is a different body, you need not turn back from the war. He explained that in verses 26, 27, and 28. Even a non-believer of `a:thma` (soul) need not worry when having to perform their responsibilities. This was explained during the same time when the soul’s nature was being described, from `ja:thasya hi dhruvo: mruthyuhu` (for one who is born, death is certain) onwards, for three verses.\nIn the beginning of the chapter, He explained that he would accrue three sins if he did not fight the war: `ana:rya jushtam` (unacceptable to the wise), `asvargyam` (not leading to heaven), and `aki:rthikaram` (resulting in infamy).\n`ana:rya jushtam` (unacceptable to the wise): None of the Wise will accept this. All the Wise do have `de:ha:thma vive:kam` (knowledge of the soul and the body). They wish that we all act with that knowledge. If we do not act with that knowledge, they are not happy. They feel sad and pity us. You are behaving bereft of that knowledge. The attitude to turn away from the war will not make the Wise happy.\nThe second one is `asvargyam` (not leading to heaven): He thought that he would attain heaven by turning his back on the war because he would then not accrue the sin of killing people. That is not the case. You will indeed incur sin. You are thinking you will attain heaven but that is not going to happen. He explained these in two verses, 31 and 32. Your attitude of turning your back on this war is a blocker to heaven. He clarified this.\nThe third reason He mentioned was `aki:rthikaram` (resulting in infamy): Nobody will say that Arjuna is very compassionate as he did not fight the war. They would say you are a coward, useful for nothing. “His boastful words reached the skies when there were no warriors around.” “When it was time for the war, he turned his back.” Thus, there will be no one flying the kites of fame. “You will be only blamed.” `nindanthaha thava sa:mardhyam` (They will blame your strength). `thatho: dukha tharam nukim` (What could be more painful than that?). He asked! He explained this in five verses. In verses 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, He said that turning your back on war will not bring you any fame. `ana:rya jushtam` (unacceptable to the wise), `asvargyam` (not leading to heaven), `aki:rthikaram` (resulting in infamy). Because He explained that he would accrue three sins. He also explained why they accrue sin and why it is essential to be relieved from them. To do so, the scripture went along until verse 37. Until the stage was preset with this, Arjuna’s mind was not in a state to understand his responsibility as a human being, as a soul when indwelling the body. That is why Chapter 2 explained `nithya:thma` (eternity of soul).\nNext, `asanga karma i:ha` (desire for action without attachment). `iha` (desire). What should he desire? He should desire `asanga karma` (action without attachment). We all know that `karma` (activity) is the activity we do. `Sangam` (attachment) is the feeling that I am doing the activity, it is happening because of me, and the result is all mine. These are the three feelings that tie him up to the work that one is doing. This is called `sankalpam` (resolve/intention). One should carry out `karma` (action) without that `sangam` (attachment). It is never right to stop doing `karma` (action). He said, `karmanye:va:dhika:rasthe: ma: phale:shu kada:chana` (You have the right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action). How is this `asanga karma` (action without attachment) done? From verse 38 to verse 53 of the scripture, He explained how and why `asanga karma` (action without attachment) must be done. During this, some might do `karma` (action) without leaving the `sanga` (attachment). That is, they desire for something or want to attain something out of it. Not only do they do it, but also encourage others to follow the same. “This is what you should do as well. You should do this if you desire that and all.” God has in fact condemned such people, who are corrupting the system and encouraging others also in the same direction. Because anyone could get attracted to temporary profits. If a temporary happiness is awaiting, anyone would want to experience it. So, three verses 42, 43, and 44 regulate people who are encouraging that direction. `ya:mima:m pushpitha:m va:cham pravadanthi` (those who talk this way) are `avipaschithaha` (fools). He clarifies that those who talk this way lead people in the wrong direction.\nNext, there was a question about `sthittha prajna` (one having proper knowledge in a firm and stable state). To answer that, He begins at verse 55 and concludes at the chapter’s last verse 72. `sthittha dhi: laksha: pro:ktha:` (the characteristics of a steady-minded person are explained). How does a `sthittha prajna` (person of steady wisdom) conduct himself? Why does he behave that way? Why does he reach that state? How does he reach that state? He had to explain all this in Chapter 2. `dvithi:ye: pro:ktha: thunmo:ha sa:nthaye:` (In the second chapter, it is explained for the removal of ignorance). To relieve Arjuna from `mo:ha` (ignorance), He explained all of these. Saying so, Yamunacharya Swami gave the summary of the essence of Chapter 2 in one verse. This is the summary of what we have gone through so far as Chapter 2 of the scripture.\nIn this Chapter 2, there are some aspects. One is `karma` (action). It must be performed. Everyone must do so. Be it a common man, or a `jna:ni` (learned person). He may be in the beginning stages, or in an intermediate stage, or in a ripened stage. Whoever it may be, no one is allowed to stop doing their `karma` (action). Everyone must definitely do it. However, when you are doing `karma` (action), don’t just do `karma` (action), transform it as `karma yo:ga` (yoga of action) and do it. How do we transform it and why should we do so? We must know this, shouldn’t we? Chapter 3 has come into picture for that reason. Chapter 4 tells us about the underlying `jna:na` (knowledge) that tells one why he is doing something. That `jna:na` (knowledge) is called `jna:na` (knowledge). `Karma` (action) must go on, taking the support of `jna:na` (knowledge). He clearly and carefully explains these two in that chapter. This is called `jna:na` (knowledge). One must perform `karma` (action) transforming `jna:na` (knowledge) as `yo:ga` (a means). If one wants to do that, He has already explained `karma` (action). He explains that `jna:na` (knowledge) in Chapter 4. Next, He explains how one must regulate `manas` (the mind) while performing `karma` (action) and how to behave in life. This is explained in Chapter 5.\nComing to Chapter 6, one must do `sa:dhana` (spiritual practice) of what he has learned. Isn’t it? One cannot be satisfied with just knowledge. If one speaks out, “eating food satiates hunger” repeatedly, does it satisfy him? It’s okay if he does not. He must have the food itself. Only then, his hunger is met. So, He had to teach a means to attain what a `ji:va` (human being/individual soul) must attain. Named as `a:thma samyama yo:ga` (yoga of self-control), it explains how you can attain regulating `manas` (the mind). Where should you sit, how should you sit, what should you do? `Manas` (the mind) keeps getting distracted. How can you regulate it? All these details are explained in the name of `a:thma samyama yo:ga` (yoga of self-control) in Chapter 6. Thus, He clarifies `karma yo:ga` (yoga of action), that `karma` (action) which must be done while an `a:thma` (soul) is in a body, that which is given as the summary of Chapter 2. He details each part, and then consolidates them. He explains how one must realize when all of it is put together. What is the benefit of understanding it that way? Yamunacharya Swami explains that this is what was taught.\nBhagavad Ramanujacharya composed `vya:khya:nam` (commentary) on Bhagavad Gita. It is called `Gita Bha:shyam` (Commentary on the Gita). When he was composing it, he used Yamunacharya Swami’s verses as the supporting foundation. It is clear in his commentary that he was penning it in such a way that it does not deviate from it. In fact, because of that composition, we never see anything that does not fit together. The pre and post fit the context and are in-line with each other. We can see how each chapter fits with one another retaining the oneness of all statements. We can see how the whole of it is in sync with every statement. If that is not there, the scripture cannot give us comprehensive understanding/knowledge. All these aspects are in this. Let’s attempt to carefully learn them one after another. Let’s enter Chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nWhat is the purpose of human birth?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights all the worlds.\n-----------------------------------------------\nScriptures say, durlabho: ma:nusho: de:haha de:hina:m (rare is human body for embodied beings). These sari:ra dha:ras (those who hold bodies), embodied beings, are of many types. There are animals, birds, worms, insects, and many more… It is said that there are 84 lakhs of species. Amongst all the species, birth as a human is a very rare boon. We all have got that [boon]. We all are de:hi (those with bodies). No one can tell precisely how long this [human body] will last. Because sometimes one who is thought to be having a strong body might lose life all of a sudden. Or someone who we think will lose life no matter what we do may remain alive for a long time. Nobody knows the reason for this.\nWhen in a human body, what is the activity that one must do? Earn, eat, go around, reproduce, fear, sleep! All these are common for any living being. What is the uniqueness of a human being? Is there anything special that one must attain for being a human? Yes, there is. All the sages who are tha:tthvika jna:nis (those with wisdom of eternal realities) have confirmed it. Vedas say it. Upanishads declare it. The rest of the [Vedic] literature says it. They all declare that the purpose of human birth is purusho:tthama pra:pthi (attaining God).\nThe scriptures that explain this in clarity are called ve:da:ntha grantthas (scriptures that explain the essence of Vedas). Ve:dam (knowledge) means knowledge. It also means to know. Ve:dam (knowledge) is that which gives knowledge of what one doesn’t know. Vedas are those teachings that have come to enlighten. In them, the teachings which summarise the essence is called Ve:da:ntha (essence of Vedas). It is also a scripture that orders. What do all these Ve:da:nthas (essence of Vedas) state? There is one thatthva (reality) that is directing/governing all of us. That thatthva (reality) is called Na:ra:yana thatthva (Narayana reality) or Parambramha thatthva (Supreme Reality).\nna:ra:yanaha parambramha gi:tha:sa:sthre: sami:rithaha (Narayana is the Supreme Reality, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita scripture). We discussed this earlier. Gi:tha:rttha Sangraha (Summary of the Meaning of the Gita) given by Yamunacharya Swami explains this. A lot of people have questions about what the Parabramha thatthva (Supreme Reality) is. Some say Parabramha (Supreme Reality) is purusha (a man). Some say Parabramha (Supreme Reality) is a woman. Maybe some others say various other things. However, ve:da:ntha sa:sthra (Vedic scriptures) ensures there is no such dilemma about it.\nWhat is that Parabramha (Supreme Reality) like? There are no kinds of limits to it. There are no kinds of do:shas (faults). There are no characteristics that have limitations. It has wonderful kalya:na gunas (auspicious qualities). What are kalya:na gunas (auspicious qualities)? They are favorable to Him; always bestowing bliss and auspiciousness to all the worlds. He has such greatest qualities in Him. How many such qualities are there? There are countless such qualities.\nasankhye:ya kalya:na guna gana o:gha maha: arnava (an endless great ocean of countless groups of auspicious qualities flowing like a massive stream). Ganas (groups of), gunas (qualities). Not one or two qualities, they are groups of qualities. Some qualities together make a group. He has countless such groups. They all move as a o:gha (massive flow). That massive flow reaches Him, the maha: arnava (an endless great ocean). God’s greatness is thus described. He is given a beautiful name, purusho:tthama (Supreme Being).\nWhat is the meaning of purusho:tthama (Supreme Being)? Dwelling in these bodies, we all are named purusha (embodied being). ‘We’ refers to all human beings. Let’s put the other species aside for the time being. Let’s look at human beings. There are two groups in this, purusha (men) and sthri (women). It is said that they are grouped based on karma (actions). Keeping that aside, any soul for as long as it is dwelling in a body and leading life is called purusha (embodied being). How about women? Women are also named purusha (embodied being). Because the body is named puramu (residence). He/she lives in this residence. pure: asmin se:the: (he/she is constantly living in it). Ji:va (soul) is constantly in it until karma (actions) is exhausted.\nHowever, there is only One who will never leave this material substance. That is Him. Does He also exist in a dead body? Yes. Then why do people say it is not to be touched, that one should take a bath if they touch? When the body goes through a fire ritual, if He is also in there…! Nothing can exist without Him. It can be a dead body or anything else. If He is not there, nothing can actually exist. The body in that shape which we see had already been allocated by Him to a soul for karma anubhavam (experiencing karma). That body is allocated to a soul. The soul can experience the body only if He exists along with him. Therefore, He was with the soul and enabled the experience. That is now completed. The allocated time-frame is over and hence the soul left the body. Now, that body is called a sava (a dead body). It may be called a dead body, but no one can stop God’s existence in it. When He exists everywhere, He exists in it also.\nHowever, after qualifying that body for further purposes, He changes it to other dravyas (substances). Because it is allocated for a specific soul, no one else is allowed to use it. It has to be disintegrated back to the root elements. The Earth component will go back to being part of the original earth. Water component to being part of the original water. Air to air, space to space etc. They all get recycled and only then allocated to someone else. Therefore, God exists in the dead body as well. However, that does not mean the body gets up and moves. If at all for some reason, a dead body gets up and sits up, everyone will be scared. It is also dangerous. If doctor’s diagnosis goes wrong and there is a false declaration of death, if that ‘dead man’ is brought back home and he wakes up in the midst of some concluding rituals, then it’s a different story. However, if a dead body comes ‘alive’ for some other reasons, then it becomes essential for those learned, to take responsibility and not let that happen. It [dead body] should not get up again because the elements must go back to their original state. The recycling must happen there only.\nFor example, governments allocate lands to certain people. They are called D Patta lands. Those who got those lands are not allowed to sell them to anyone. They can use it. They can have their heirs use it. If they ever feel that they do not need the land, they can surrender it to the government. They cannot sell it secretly in black money to anyone. If it gets surrendered to the government, then the government considers how to utilise it. The same applies to the soul also. Once a body is allocated to a soul, then he must go through only those given experiences for the given time. He will then leave the body. Once he leaves the body, what happens to the body? He is not allowed to donate the body for someone else. After the body is integrated into the original elements, then He [God] prepares it ready for a new body. This is the rule. So, for as long as a soul is in the body, he/she is called purusha (embodied being).\nTo bestow these embodied beings with right paths, right procedure to implement, or impart wisdom required, God descends to the world taking such bodies. They are called avatharas (incarnations). There are various types of incarnations. Some are sa:ksha:d avatharas (direct incarnations), Himself. Some are a:ve:sha avatharas (empowered incarnations). Some are swaru:pa avatharas (essential form incarnations), amsa avatharas (partial incarnations), kala avatharas (fractional incarnations). There are different states of avatharas (incarnations). Whatever may be, He ‘comes down’ to this world as well. However, His ‘coming’ is not like ours. We come because we are helpless, having been forced by the karma (actions). We come [take birth here] and experience karma (actions). He [God] does not come like that driven by some force. He wills to ‘come down’ to alleviate the souls from their pain. That is why, He takes a form that is appropriate for that reason. Therefore, despite being ‘embodied’, He is different from the rest of embodied beings. He is thus named purusha utthama (Supreme Being) in the Upanishads and also in chapter 15 of Bhagavad Gita. We are all therefore purushas (embodied beings). And He is the purusho:tthama (Supreme Being) who has come to this world. He is the abode of all kalyana gunas (auspicious qualities). He, God is known by the names such as parabramha (Supreme Reality), purusho:tthama (Supreme Being).\nWe came to this world as human beings so that we recognise Him. If the goal is to live like other beings, then we don’t need such an intellect. Other beings do not have this kind of intellect. They have the ability to carry out activities necessary at the physical body level. However, a human being is given great intellect to do beyond that. Direct the given intellect with love for God. Recognise that God is the means. Know that the goal is to attain God. Lead life with that knowledge. Then, he will be cut off from the bond he has [with karma (actions)]. He will then be able to attain God. A human body is given for that purpose, i.e to attain Him. Our people have given a name for this called mo:ksha (liberation). Mo:ksha (liberation) means to get released from karma bandha (bondage with karma). We need some kind of means to get released from it. That means is bhakthi (devotion). If this becomes a means, it breaks the bondage with karma (actions). That helps us to be detached with the body and creates an opportunity to happily reach God. The purpose of all sa:sthras (scriptures) is to tell us this. The entire Vedic literature has come to light to state the same. Bhagavad Gita is imparting the same in a simpler manner.\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of gurus).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nAs we enter chapter 3, let us try to build clarity on certain topics.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAll human beings leading a general life are called karma baddhas (those who are bound by karma). Karma baddhas mean those who are bound by limitations of karma (past records). All are bound by karma. However, some of the karma baddhas desire to come out of karma and not be dictated by it. When in this body, nothing is happening as per our wish. What is happening is that we plan on something, and the result is something else. We try to let that go and want to sleep. We can’t sleep. We don’t want to feel hungry because we are in the midst of some work. Yet, like that of animals, there is a growling and rumbling noise from the stomach, out of hunger. None of these things are the way we desire them to be. We have to walk the direction that the body is taking us.\nSome people genuinely desire to come out of this bondage. If that desire takes a proper route in the manner prescribed in Veda (sacred texts), then he/she is called mumukshu (one who wishes to be released from this bondage [of karma]). Some don’t even realize that they are bound. They don’t feel any desire to come out of this. They feel that life is going on, let it continue. Some want to strengthen it [bondage with karma] further and further. Such people are called bhubhukshus (those who desire to eat and live).\nSo, human beings can be categorized into two. One is bhubhukshuvu (one who desires to eat and live). They desire to eat and live, that’s all. The other is mumukshuvu (one who desires release). They desire a release [from the bondage] and try for it. Mumukshuvu desire and attain release from the karmic bondage. This release is named moksha (release). What they desire is release from the bondage with karma. Some people think moksha is death. When one is released from the bondage with karma, there won’t be any problem wherever he is. Bhagavad Gita is the supreme teaching that has come to teach us about such moksha.\nHow is one released from the karmic bondage? Firstly, what is karma (work/action)? It is just about anything we do. We do something or the other when we are in a body. We can’t sit idle, can we? “No sir! we meditate and sit in an idle posture.” That is also work! Closing eyes is a task. Breathing in is a task. Breathing out is a task. “We don’t take breath at all. We hold it.” That is also work. Any movement in the body is a result of some work, some karma. We are currently conducting ourselves under the limitations of karma. Karma should become a means. We must work with the body, but that work shouldn’t entangle us further. It must become something that can release us from any previous entanglement.\nBhagavad Gita is moksha shastra (a scripture enlightening about one’s release). This moksha shastra [talks about] who it is that can release one from karma. Whoever has tied one to it, only they can untie and release [the entangled one]. Bhagavan (the Supreme Soul) is the one who created this bond with karma. He is named Param Brahma (the Supreme One). How does He release you from it? If He must release you, athyanthika bhakthi (incessant devotion) for Him must grow in you. Athyanthika means that which eternally goes on. Bhakthi that is eternally flowing. What is bhakthi (devotion)? It is uncontaminated love. One must have uncontaminated love. It is named athyanthika bhakthi. Either one has this, or God will enable that state in one and then release them from karmic bondage.\nVedantha shastra (the essence of Vedas) denoted this bhakthi with certain names. It is called vedana (meditation fueled with in-depth knowledge), upasana (meditation with close proximity to the goal), dhyana bhakthi (meditation with intensified focus). All these are different names for the incessantly living love one has for God. The term love seems familiar to us but the term bhakthi feels heavy and vedanthic (scriptural essence). Since we are learning Bhagavad Gita, it is essential to know what these terms mean. We must remember these and use them in our day to day life too.\nGenerally, people tend to use it to state that he/she or someone they know is a great bhaktha (devotee). People, in this world, termed any positive feeling towards God as bhakthi. If one [mechanically] engages oneself in a ritual or chants a prayer, people call it bhakthi. It’s fine. We can’t deny that. However, that’s a very very basic and primary level. It is a state prior to what can be termed as bhakthi.\nInitially, a seed gradually gives out a stem and then produces what look like small leaves. They grow a little bigger, and the branches grow bigger. From in between them, something in the form of small clusters appear. Then, flowers blossom from them. Those flowers yield fruit. The fruit are initially in a very small size that one can’t even see. They will then gradually grow bigger but are not ripe yet. They grow further into ripe fruits. Following that is the state where they are juicy. That is when they become enjoyable. There is the very initial state where the fruit can’t even be termed as fruit. Take that very initial state as what people generally refer to as bhakthas (devotees) or bhakthi. Such as where people say, ’our friend has a lot of bhakthi.” All these are of that state.\nIn fact, only the following can be called bhakthi:\n*   vedanam (meditation fueled with in-depth knowledge)\n*   dhyanam (meditation with intensified focus)\n*   upasana (meditation with close proximity to the goal)\nScriptures concluded that only whatever can be assigned these names, be called bhakthi. Only when that exists, there is a chance that the person gets the grace of God. What is the preface or the foundation for such bhakthi? One must attain jnana (knowledge). One must attain thad vishai:ka jnana (the knowledge of that thing). Knowledge of what thing? The knowledge of soul, and the knowledge of Param Brahma (Supreme One) who can liberate the soul. One must know about both of these. If you don’t know about what you want to attain, how would you know if you have attained it? Therefore, if you want the grace of Param Brahma… You must know who Param Brahma is. How to know about Him? What do you do after knowing about Him? Firstly, do I have the eligibility to attain Him? Then, you should know who you are. You should know from that level. You should know all these.\nUpanishads give the knowledge of all these. There is an upanishad named Chandogya. There is a discussion between Indra and the Prajapati. Prajapati gives clarity to Indra on this topic. Firstly, he gives the knowledge of a soul. He goes on to explain what a soul is, and continues on what happens when etc. He says, it is therefore something you can attain. After listening to all that, Indra says that he doesn’t find it very appealing. He says, na: mathra bho:gyam pasya:mi (I do not see anything enjoyable here). Then, Prajapati sets out to teach him what is to be learned. Chandogya Upanishad describes it. He starts off clarifying the knowledge about athma swarupa (understanding of self). If one attains this kind of jnana (knowledge)… and it ripens into bhakthi (devotion)… If that jnana ripens into bhakthi… With that bhakthi alone, Parabrahma can be attained. With only this, can one be released from the bondage of karma. What that means is he will attain moksha (release). He will have reached the purpose of becoming a mumukshu (one who desires release). He [Prajapati] clarifies all this there.\nIf one attains this knowledge of atma (soul), it is called athma sakshatkaram (self-realization) or athma darsanam (self-realization). You hear the word darsanam (perception), do you think atma is something that’s visible to our eyes? It is not visible to the naked eye. Then, why is it called darsanam? Darsanam does not mean being visible to the eyes. If it can be perceived by something, it is called darsanam (perception) or sakshatkaram (perception). Not everything in the world is visible to the naked eye. Some forms are visible to the eyes. That is called shape. If something is in the shape of a square, rectangle, circle. So, it’s the shape and also color. Eye can only grasp the shape and the color only. Eye doesn’t grasp sound, smell, or taste. There are other sense organs that can help perceive them. If one must perceive sound, shravanendriyam (the organ of sound), must work. If one must perceive taste, rasanendriyam (the organ of taste), must work. If one must perceive smell, ghranendriyam (the organ of smell), must work. If one must know if something is hard, soft, cold etc, thvagindriyam (organ of touch), must work. In addition to these 5 sense organs, there is an internal organ called manas (mind). What it perceives is called manasa sakshatkaram (mental perception). It is also called manasa darsanam (mental perception).\nWhen one attains athma sakshatkaram (self-realization), self-realization, then, in him/her… there is a bhagavad bhakthi (devotion for God). That is when God’s grace is bestowed and that releases one from karma. Hence, athma sakshatkaram (self-realization) is a pre-qualification for being released from karma. This is what Prajapati’s statements tell us. After one attains this, i.e. knowing that soul is eternal, body is not eternal… and one must carry on their work with no sanga (attachment), then… if that results in bhakthi (devotion), devotion to God, only such bhakthi results in moksha (release). All this is like a tall ladder. The prakarana (the section) of Chandogya Upanishad that explains this is called dahara vidya (knowledge of the subtle space within the heart).\nWhat does dahara vidya detail? Firstly, he talks about the soul’s characteristics.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nya a:thma: apahathapa:pma: vijaraha vimruthyuhu viso:ka: vijigathsaha apipa:saha\nsathyaka:maha sathyasankapaha so:nve:shtavyaha sajigna:sithavyaha sasarva:nscha\nlo:ka:n a:pno:thi sarva:scha ka:ma:n yasthma:thma:na:m anuvidya vija:na:thi\nithiha praja:pathiruva:cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe soul (atma) is free from sin, free from old age, free from death, free from sorrow, free from hunger, free from thirst, whose desires are true, whose resolves are true. This soul should be sought, this soul should be known. He who finds and knows this soul obtains all worlds and all desires. Thus spoke Prajapati.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn the 8th prapatakam (chapter), of Chandogya, it is Brahma’s upadesa (teaching) to Indra. It is the prakarana (section), which explains that only when one has the knowledge of atma (soul), will he be qualified to attain God. We will move ahead understanding a bit more about what he explained there.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIn Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Sri Krishna explained atma swarupa (the form of the soul).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and is the delight of the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is this soul like? What is it that one must attain so the soul never gets bound with karma (actions), instincts from the past? Upanishads detailed these. It seems that bhagavan (God) exists within all of us. Scriptures named the indwelling God as antaryami (indwelling God).\nantha ha + yami (dwelling inside + operates). That is why He is named antaryami.\nya: atmanam antharo: yama yathi (He dwells within and gives orders). We must all operate as per His order. Not only human beings, all others also must follow His orders. Other beings can’t know this. As human beings we have the chance to know it.\nIn our hrudaya (heart), there is a space named dahara akasam (space in the heart). This is mentioned in the 8th prapatakam (chapter) of Chandogya Upanishad. We must perform upasana (meditation) in close vicinity of paramatma (God) who dwells in dahara akasam. Upasana, dhyanamu (meditation), vedanamu (knowledge), bhakthi (devotion) are all synonyms. In our language, it is called prema (love). Uncontaminated love meaning love that does not expect anything in return. Love God in that manner with devotion.\nThen, there is a space called dahara akasam (space in the heart) or dahara pundarikam (lotus of the heart) in hrudaya (heart). God dwells in that space along with the jiva (soul). God dwells in all of our hrudayas (hearts) at dahara akasam. However, we don’t know. We can’t see it. It cannot be captured by any machinery. It does not get detected in any CT or PET scan if one wants to try and locate it. They can only detect what is made out of physical elements. There is no way that they can detect what is made with tejas (cosmic brilliance). So, one can’t see dahara akasam, or jiva (soul) or paramatma (God). Only if they are there, the body will move or else it will not have any movements. We must perform upasana (meditation) of that paramatma (God) who is in the dahara akasam.\nHow do we perform upasana (meditation) and why should we perform upasana (meditation)? To answer why… Do you know who you are and what your greatness is? If you want to know your greatness, you should do upasana (meditation). Am I that great? Indra asked Prajapati how great he is. He gave an answer to that.\nThe soul, i.e. you who is dwelling inside is apahathapapma (blemishless), qualified for not being touched by any dosha (sin). Because of your ajnana (ignorance) and moha (attachment), you are dumping everything onto yourself and becoming entangled in them. However, the characteristic of your natural form is not that which gets you entangled in them.\napahathapapma (blemishless)\nNot just that, it is vijaraha (changeless). Everything ‘touches’ the body, but nothing touches you. Whatever touches the body remains with the body. When the families dispose of the body post its lifetime, the impacts of the body are also gone. The jiva (soul) that leaves the body goes out without any of them. He is not the type that gets ‘touched’ by any of them. He is therefore named apahathapapma (blemishless).\nWhen the body goes through any change, that is termed jara (change). However, a jiva (soul) does not undergo any change. He remains only in one form. Unchanged. He is therefore named vijaraha (changeless).\nVimruthyuhu (does not die)\nMrityuvu (death) does not get a hold on the jiva (soul). It can catch the body. Death can make the body unusable. It cannot do the same with atma (soul). Therefore, since he is beyond mrithyuvu (death), he is vimruthyuvu (does not die).\nVisokaha (has no sadness)\nSokaha (sadness), it is that which makes one feel that something of his is lost or gone. Soka (sadness) is not natural for atma (soul). However, because he is thinking that the gains and losses of the body he is dwelling in, as his own, he feels sad or happy. Let’s place a red hibiscus next to a crystal frame made of glass. When a light reflects on the flower, the adjacent crystal frame also looks red like the flower. The glass misleads us about its color, as if red, by assuming the qualities of its neighbor as its own. Similarly, because a jiva (soul) is in an object called body that grows, shrinks, etc, he thinks it’s all his. In reality, he does not have any of that. He is vimrithyuhu (has no death), visokaha (has no sadness) as he has nothing to lose or gain.\nBody is made of five elements of nature. When one of them decreases in quantity, it emits an alarm. If one of them increases, it emits alarms. These alarms are called hunger, thirst etc. If mrud dravya (earth material), the percentage of earth material decreases as you are working, then the warning the body gives to fill that gap is called hunger. The desire to eat, i.e. mrud dravya (earth material) is emptied, fill it up again. This is named hunger. Atma (soul) does not have hunger of this type.\nVijigathsaha (has no hunger)\nApipasaha (has no thirst)\nThere is also a percentage of water in the body. When we exercise or work, the water from within comes out in the form of sweat or in some other form. The required proportion of water in the body has decreased. Because it decreased in quantity, it gives a warning. The water percentage has come down. Refill, refill, refill. When traveling by car, the oil drops below the desired limit. When it reaches 15 or 20 liters or whatever border limit, that’s when a red warning indicator is seen. For us in the body, perhaps the warnings are the types we need, so that’s how it is programmed to alert. Some things give an alarm by beeping indicating to refill. Similarly, the desire to refill the decreased percent of water in the body is called thirst. So, the desire in relation to the inflow and outflow of the elements in the body are given various names. Atma (soul) does not have such hunger, thirst.\nvijigathsaha (has no hunger), apipasaha (has no thirst)\nIn that case, what does it have?\nsathya sankalpaha (thinks good), sathya kamaha (desires good)\nIt will always think good. Atma (soul) always desires good. Truly, it should be desiring God. It has the power to achieve anything that it wants. Instead, we turned towards the body, got attached to it and got bound by karma (actions). This resulted in suppressing them. They are named sathya kama (desires good) and sathya sankalpa (thinks good).\nThere are 6 that denote what it is without. There are 2 that denote what it has.\napahathapapma (blemishless), vijaraha (changeless), vimruthyuhu (does not die), visoka (has no sadness), vijigathsaha (has no hunger), apipasaha (has no thirst).\nsathya kamaha (desires good) and sathya sankalpaha (thinks good) are the 2 qualities that a soul must possess. These 8 are called ashta-gunas (8 qualities). If these ashta gunas (8 qualities) are suppressed, it is called karma bandha (bound by actions). When karma bandha (bond of actions) is broken and ashta gunas (8 qualities) rise, it is called moksha (bliss/liberation). We all want moksha (liberation). We all want to be released from the bond [of karma]. After that release, one must have clarity on who the indwelling ‘I’ is. This is called ashta-guna avirbhavam (the rise of 8 qualities of the soul). What we need to do while we are in this body is ashta-guna avirbhavam (the rise of 8 qualities of the soul).\nChandogya Upanishad enlightens us of this in the name of dahara vidya (knowledge of the inner space). As Brahma ji (Lord Brahma) was explaining these to Indra, he described the states of the souls who have attained ashta-guna avirbhavam (the rise of 8 qualities of the soul).\nFirst one is jagrath (state of being awake to the physical world).\nswapna (state of sleep).\nsushupthi (state of deep sleep).\nThe state between being awake and deep sleep is the time of dreams. We see a variety of dreams. Sometimes we run on rivers, or fly in the air. It all seems magical. He elucidated on the three states: jagrath (state of being awake), swapna (state of sleep) and sushipthi (state of deep sleep).\nIndra heard all of this. He said that all of these are not seeming like any happy states. He said that they all seem alpam (petty). Why? Parabrahma (supreme reality) has a quality called amruthatthvam (state of unchanging and everlasting bliss). It doesn’t seem like the soul you explained, who attained ashta-guna avirbhavam (the rise of 8 qualities of the soul) will have it. Because if he has it, why would he ever enter bandha (bond)? He should never have entered it, right? Now that he has entered bandha (bond), it means that the qualities are not always alive in him. Therefore, the states jagrath (state of being awake), swapna (state of sleep) and sushupthi (state of deep sleep) are those which bound him. However, he reaches God in those states. Yet, because of the pull of karma (actions), he comes back to this world. He wakes up. Coming and going everyday, this shouldn’t be the state to desire. If we reach, we must reach Him forever.\nWhen he [Indra] says this, then he [Brahma] explains how to attain that. Dear! Honestly, it is difficult to attain that state when you are in this body.\nasari:ram va: vasantham priya: priye: na sprusathaha (as long as one is in a body, one cannot get away from pleasures and pains).\nIt does not matter what kind of body, it could be of jiva (soul), human or Brahma. As long as one is in it, one cannot get away from the pleasures and pains. Whenever one leaves this body that is formed because of karma (actions), he will attain it. “How is that attained?”, he asks. Answering that, he says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:vame:va e:sha samprasa:daha asma:th sari:ra:th samuttha:ya\nparamjyo:thirupa sampadya sve:na ru:pe:na abhi nishpadyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis purified soul, rising from this body, attains the supreme light and manifests in its own true form.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe summarized it. It means… He gave a name to this jiva (soul) and called it samprasadaha (one who has attained the grace of God). Samprasadaha (one who has attained the grace of God) means one who has attained the grace of God in the way that He is pleased with. Only such a soul can come out of this. How can one please God? He explained this. Let us learn that and move ahead gradually.\nJai Srimannarayana!\nJai Srimannarayana!"

It is a beautifully delivered teaching, which even a common man can comprehend and implement. Despite the fact that it looks like a conversation between Krishna and Arjuna, it is not a casual conversation for passing time. Additionally, it was not delivered just to motivate Arjuna to fight the war that he did not want to. Using one Arjuna as a medium, this teaching is to enlighten every soul who is in a human body on the opportunity to attain salvation.\nCurrently, all of them [on earth] are stuck in a bondage. They cannot behave independently as long as they are in this. But by nature, these ji:vas (souls) are all eligible to be free to do whatever they want. However, after getting stuck in this body, they lost the capability of being free. Then what should we do? Our goal should be to regain what we have lost. Whatever we imposed on ourselves as ours during this time, we should keep it at a distance. We need to know this.\nGod [Krishna] explained this concept to Arjuna very clearly in chapter 2. In chapter 3, He explains what needs to be done. Before embarking on that… He must explain that the primary duty for a soul, while in this body, is to recognize, understand and surrender to God. He must explain that bhakti (devotion) is a means to do so. Before bhakti (devotion) is developed in one, one needs to be clear about who he is. Only if he knows that, he can recognize his [original] great state and pursue it. When a lion is hanging out with a bunch of goats as one of them, if someone tells him, that he is a lion and he is currently not in his original status, only then will the lion try to regain his status. It is the same for a soul. He has a human body and it is not simply for eating, roaming around and leaving. These things are done by other living beings. Who are you, what is your capability, what a great status you are at. And the fact is that the journey to the goal from here is short. This you need to know. This is mentioned in the Upanishads. This is called atma darsanam (self-realization), or atma saksatkaram (self-realization). When this occurs, devotion builds, and God can be attained.\nAtma darsanam (self-realization) is not the means by itself. Only if atma darsanam (self-realization) transforms into devotion, then it becomes a means for salvation. Devotion is the only means which helps reach God, this is clearly mentioned in vedanta (essence of Vedas).\nna:nyah panttha: ayana:ya vidyathe: (There is no other path for salvation.)\nThe eighth chapter of Chandogya Upanishad reveals that a great being called Prajapati told the same to Indra. This is what we discussed. As part of that, he says…\nbhagavad darsanam… paramjyo:thirupasampajyathe: (God-realization… he will reach the Paramjyothi (Supreme Light/God))\nWhen?\ne:shaha samprasa:daha asma:th sareera:th sumuttha:ya (When he fulfills all the duties during his tenure in this body as service to Paramjyothi (Supreme Light/God), to His [God’s] satisfaction.)\nWhen is he [soul] able to do this? When he doesn’t have pride and arrogance that he is doing everything. Or… When he recognizes that He [God] is the actual doer. And thus instead of thinking “A little for Him and a little for me!”, works without feeling attached to its result. When he is able to perform karma (actions) without attachment to it. When done this way, then his natural form will radiate as desired. Then he becomes someone who pleases God. Only through implementation of this type of karma (actions)...asma:th sari:ra:th samuththa:ya (from this body, rising up). Everyone has to leave this body at one point or the other. Everyone who is born, has to wait for the time to leave the body. When he [Soul] leaves this body, paramjyo:thirupasampadya (reaching the Paramjyothi (Supreme Light/God)), he reaches God. Then sve:na ru:pe:na abhinishpadyathe (by his own form, he shines forth), whatever is his natural form, that shines. We discussed in the past regarding ashtaguna avirbhavam (the rise of 8 qualities). There are always eight gunas (qualities) for us [souls]. We are capable of shining in eight different ways! But it is blocked because of this karma (actions). That blockade needs to be removed and we need to shine.\nabhinishpadyathe: (shines forth)\nUpanishad clearly mentioned this and is giving us confidence! Only after listening to this was Indra satisfied. Upanishad tells us this. Therefore, atma saksatkaram (self-realization) alone is not the result. It is the bhagavad saksatkaram (God-realization), the outcome of bhakti (devotion) which is built up from atma saksatkaram (self-realization). Atma saksatkaram (self-realization) is like a small droplet. Bhagavad saksatkaram (God-realization) is like a vast ocean. Therefore, we cannot stop at the droplet. We need to go all the way to the ocean. The knowledge to attain this, is only available in this human body. In other bodies, it is not possible to comprehend this knowledge. That is why, atma darsanam (self-realization) is a step towards the moksha (salvation) called Paramatma saksatkaram (God-realization). For atma saksatkaram (self-realization), we need to know about the soul. How to know about the soul is mentioned in chapter 2. This knowledge is not something which you just listen to once and leave it at that. It is essential that this knowledge is stabilized within. And needs to support every task that is performed. Then he needs to know how to perform the tasks. In order to know how to perform these tasks, chapter 3 has come into play. All the Upanishads say…\nBhagavad darsanam (God-realization) resulting from atma darsanam (self-realization).\nThere is an Upanishad called Katha, Katavalli. This is mentioned in the samhita part of the Veda. It is also part of Upanishad. In that [Katha Upanishad] Yama Dharmaraja gives guidance to Nachiketas. He first states where God exists.\ntham (well-known)\ndurdarsam (He is not perceived by any of the senses which are limited by karma (past records).)\nWhere does He exist?\ngu:dam anupravishtam (He exists in our hrudaya (heart) but in an invisible corner.)\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nguha:hitham gahvare:shtam pura:nam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe is the one existing within us, in everyone’s bodies.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHowever, He is concealed as the body was being formed with the sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance). Yet, He is puranam (ancient/eternal). They block the soul but none of them can impact Him, the supporter who drives jiva (soul). He is always puranam (ancient/eternal). What does puranam (ancient/eternal) mean?\npura:pi navam (He is always shining as new.)\nThen how do we recognize Him?\nadhya:thma yo:ga:digame:na (When shuddha sattva jnana (pure sattvic knowledge) that gives knowledge of atma tattva (truth of the soul) is established.)\nThis happens as rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance), the drawbacks in mind are subdued. How will it [shuddha sattva jnana (pure sattvic knowledge)] be formed? By practice! By what practice? Practice of atma jnanam (knowledge of the soul). How is that achieved? By practicing asanga karma acharana (performance of duties without attachment). By implementing duties without attachment, you will be untouched by punya (merit) or papa (sin), the results of good and bad actions. If you are untouched by them you will be untouched by raga (attraction), or dvesha (aversion). If there is no raga (attraction) and dvesha (aversion), then rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance) subside. Sattva (goodness) flourishes. If Sattva (goodness) flourishes, one will know God. Then he….\nde:vam mathva: (recognizes and meditates upon the Supreme)\nWhoever does this...\nadhya:thma yo:ga:digame:na de:vam mathva: (through the attainment of spiritual yoga, recognizing and meditating upon the Supreme)\nOnly after that can he…\nharshasokou jaha:thi (distances away from pleasure and pain)\nOnly the one who reaches this way will also be able to attain the tattva (reality)! Then he becomes dhira (wise/steadfast). Only when he meditates upon God, he becomes…\ndhi:ra (wise/steadfast)\nthe purpose of having buddhi (intellect/mind) is met. Otherwise, we have knowledge. Where is the purpose of knowledge? Purpose of knowledge is not merely knowing materialistic objects like chair, bench etc.\nde:vam mathva: (knowing the Supreme)\nknowing the One who brought you here into this body and is leading you. Know the One who is leading, not just you, but the entire universe. Surrender to Him. You must become someone who surrenders to Him! Therefore, you need to know who the soul is; that the soul belongs to God... ...and only if you meditate upon Him, will you distance yourself from harshasokou (pleasures and pains). Only then will one know his svarupa (true form/nature).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna ja:yathe na mri:yathe: ajaha, nithyaha, sa:savathaha, pura:naha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe (the soul) is someone who neither takes birth nor dies; without a conceivable beginning, is eternal, permanent, ever fresh.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe will know that these are the qualities of the soul. How about Him [God]?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nano:rani:ya:na mahatho:mahi:ya:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe is subtler than the soul which is of size anu (the subtlest particle). He is more supreme than the biggest, greatest, most glorious of forms.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is within us. He is here only!\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nakrathu:h pasyathi thamah krathu pasyathi vi:tha so:kaha\ndha:thu prasa:da:th mahima:nam a:thmanaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe one who can stay without attaching himself to the work he is doing, who is not expecting anything, who doesn’t think that he is doing it, and doesn’t think it is happening because of him and doesn’t expect the result, he alone becomes akrathu (non-doer). Only then his sorrow will shed. Only by the grace of the One who brought him [soul] and put him here, he [soul] will be able to know his glory.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is therefore clear that God’s grace is only on the one who has attained svarupa jnana (realization of self). The svarupa jnana (realization of self) is attained by practicing nishkama karma (selfless actions). This is called karma yoga (path of action). Chapter 3 explains how and why one must practice karma (actions). In Upanishads, it is explained comprehensively. To clarify that Sri Krishna starts chapter 3. Other than that, there is no way one’s karmic bondage (bondage of actions) is removed. Also, it is impossible to reach God by one’s efforts. This is clarified very clearly in shruti (divine hearing/Vedas), such as na:yama:thma (this Self). Hence in chapter 3, Arjuna begins with a question to Sri Krishna. It starts with that question. Let us know about the question and enter the chapter.\nvande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of gurus)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBhagavad Gita is vedanta shastra (scripture of Vedanta), the essence of Vedas. Bhagavad Gita is a scripture that clarifies the essence of what you need to know. The root cause of everything is parabrahma tattva (Ultimate Reality). This tattva (reality) is always shining. There is no other place or being that has brilliance beyond that tattva’s (reality's) brilliance. The goal of any soul is to attain it. We received this body only to reach that goal. During the time we have this body, our goal is to know about the tattva (reality) and perform upasana (devotional worship) upon it. Upasana (devotional worship) means praying to it with devotion. How will one get devotion? We get it only if He bestows it to us. A wonderful Upanishad called Kathopanishad (Katha Upanishad) informs us of this. In Kathopanishad (Katha Upanishad), Yamadharma Raja (Yama, the lord of death) tells a boy called Nachiketa, about God. In that, he talks about the qualities of a soul. This soul is not one who can get destroyed. This soul is not one who can be known in any other way. There is someone who brought this soul here. He is called God. We need to perform upasana (devotional worship) upon Him. It states upasana (devotional worship) and explains that it needs to endure in the form of devotion.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvijna:na sa:radhiryasthu manah prakrarava:n naraha\nso:dhvana pa:rama:pno:thi thad vishno:h paramam padam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nVishnu, who is all-pervasive, is the Supreme, the final goal for the soul.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is the means to achieve this? One needs... vijna:na sa:radhi (real knowledge as the charioteer). Manas (mind), mind as the bridle in the hands of that charioteer. Senses, as the horses driven by the charioteer. The body is the chariot where He resides. If the charioteer is a good one, the chariot will negotiate the path and will reach the goal it should. The paths are all the vishayas (sense objects) which are experienced by the senses. For the eye, it is the shape, for the ear, it is the sound, taste for tongue, and so and so forth. If you experience these alone, the chariot gets destroyed like the one which gets rusted in the trash. The purpose of traveling on these is to reach the goal, vishno:h paramampadam (Vishnu's supreme abode). Whoever recognizes this, is the only one who gets liberated from this karmic (related to karma) bondage.\nWhen a question was raised to find how we can obtain this knowledge, He answers, “na:yama:thma pravachane:na labhyaha (This soul is not attained by mere discourse).” The knowledge regarding the underlying One, is not something which can be acquired simply by thinking. Pravachanam (discourse/deep thinking) means thinking diligently. If there is something which needs to be explained, one needs to think deeply. Isn’t it? So pravachanam (discourse/deep thinking) means our thought process, our thinking. Na:yama:thma pravachane:na labhyaha (This soul is not attained by mere discourse). He is not someone who can be achieved by thinking deeply. Na me:dhaya (not by intellect). He is not achieved through intense meditation either. Na bahuna: sruthe:na (not by much hearing). You might say, you read a lot of books, and listen to a lot of people. The more you listen to them, the more confused you get with all different paths. Like someone who is sitting in a chariot which has horses going in different directions. Then how can we obtain it? Yame:va e:sha vrunuthe the:na labhyaha (Whom He chooses, by him He is attained). Whoever He chooses to bless, only they can obtain it. That means whatever means we choose will not be successful. It is proved there that His anugraham (blessing) is the one and only means. Thasya e:sha a:thma: vivrunuthe: thanu:m sva:m (To him, this soul reveals its own form). The Lord displays His divine form only to those who are very dear to Him.\nIn the second shatkam (set of six chapters) of Bhagavad Gita, He further clarifies this topic. Na:ham ve:daihi na thapasa: na da:ne:na na che: jyaya: sakyaha: (I am not attainable by Vedas, nor by austerity, nor by charity, nor by sacrifice). After presenting the viswa ru:pam (divine universal form), he asks Arjuna, “You have now seen the viswa ru:pam (divine universal form). Are you thinking that you have seen it on your own?” Arjuna responds, “No. Since I couldn’t see it, You only have shown it to me.” Krishna says, “Yes, this form is visible only to the person I want to show it to.” “Trying to do it on their own doesn't work for anyone when it comes to identifying Me.” This is clearly mentioned. He didn’t denounce Veda (Vedas), Yajna (sacrifices) or Tapas (austerity). If he thinks that he will do them himself and see Him, it will not be possible. When He graces, He is obtained by Veda (Vedas) or can be obtained through Tapas (austerity). When He wishes, He can be attained by any means. When He doesn’t wish it, then all the different means one uses go in vain and are not fruitful. Eme: ve:sha vrunuthe: the:na labhyaha (Whom He chooses, by him He is attained). Only to him, thasyaithe a:thma: vivrunuthe: thanu:m sva:m (to him, this soul reveals its own form). This is mentioned in Upanishad. This type of knowledge needs to become our charioteer. When one has such a charioteer, so:dhvana pa:rama:pno:thi thad vishno:h paramam padam (he attains the supreme abode of Vishnu on this path), in this life’s journey, he [soul] will be able to reach the desired goal. The name of the goal is vishno:h paramam padam (Vishnu's supreme abode). This is beautifully mentioned in Upanishad and mula Vedam (original Vedas). This is the purpose of our bhakthi (devotion). In the next four chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6, He is going to explain how this can be obtained. The primary goal of these chapters is to clarify how all the means are fruitful with His anugraham (blessing).\nIn chapter 3, Arjuna starts off asking a question. He heard everything Krishna has mentioned in chapter 2. However, whenever we listen to anything, we understand it to the extent of our perspective. Currently, in the presence of Krishna, what is Arjuna’s perspective? “I do not want to wage the war. I would rather go to a forest and beg instead of waging the war.” This is Arjuna’s feeling. He threw away his bow and arrows. Radho:pastha upa:visath (sat down on the chariot seat), as mentioned in the last verse of chapter 1. Visrujya sacharam cha:pan (casting aside his bow and arrows). He [Arjuna] is asking what’s the best thing for him. But even before asking, and before seeking Krishna’s advice, Arjuna already dropped his bow. He sat collapsed in sorrow. So, what’s his [Arjuna’s] goal? “I will not wage war. So, You should tell me that it is not required to wage war.”\nSome devotees come to us; some people call themselves devotees. Before they come to us, they have already made a decision in their minds. If they are indecisive about whether to do something or not, they ask us for advice. However, they already made a decision in their mind. Let’s say they want to do something. After some questions, if we advise them that this is not the right thing to do, then they say, “Several people have advised that this is the right thing to do. Of course, whatever your advice is paramount to me, but several people are advising me to move forward. They are saying that it is dangerous not to do it. So do you advise us to do it?” What is their goal? They want to do it. Let’s say something shouldn’t be eaten but they desire to eat it. Let’s say they shouldn’t go somewhere but they want to go in their mind. They ask if they should get married a certain way. They decided to do it in their mind. He already made this decision in his mind. He just wants to get this stamped by us. So that he can claim, “Since the elders are advising me, I am doing this!” If something goes wrong, elders can be blamed for that. This is their intention. Not to get any advice from us. Arjuna is in a similar situation. Arjuna desires to quit the war and leave. He has made up his mind. To make this decision stronger, he wants Krishna to support him and advise in his favor. Arjuna says,” My heart is filled with kindness. I am indecisive on what to do. I am your disciple. Please command me what to do.” Nischithya (having decided), whatever is decided, command it. He has asked for this in the past. This is just fake. He already has something on his mind. Whatever Krishna says, it will be understood in that perspective only.\nWhat did Krishna say? Du:re:na hyavaram karma budhdhi yo:ga:th dhanajaya (Action is far inferior to the yoga of intellect, O Dhananjaya). Vyavasa:thmika: budhihi e:ka: (Resolute intellect is one-pointed). This is what He said. It [seems to] mean… Buddhi (intellect/knowledge) is the best one. Karma (action) is not as good. For you to reach salvation, karma (action) is a far shot. Buddhi (intellect/knowledge) is better. Buddhi (knowledge) is knowledge. Karma (action) is action. He [seems] to say, karma (action) is a far shot. Buddhi (knowledge) is better. What is Arjuna’s desire? Waging war means fighting, throwing arrows, getting injured etc. This is karma (action). For him this is karma (action) which he doesn’t like to do. Du:re:na hyavaram karma budhdhi yo:ga:th (Action is far inferior to the yoga of intellect). Sri Krishna seems to be saying, to attain salvation, compared to buddhi (knowledge), karma (action) is a far shot so you can keep it at a distance. Arjuna really liked this. Vyavasa:thmika: budhihi e:ka: (Resolute intellect is one-pointed). Bahusa:kha anantha:scha buddhayo: avyavasa:yina:m (The intellect of the irresolute is many-branched and endless). Vyavasa:thmika: budhihi (resolute intellect) is the only one which will elevate you. Then He named it as sthitha prajnatha (steadfast wisdom). This is something which can be known just by hearing. This doesn’t entail any action. This means you just go under a tree, wear a simple cloth, and simply listen to someone who is preaching. No need to do any work. Nishkriyam (inaction), mode of inaction. This is Arjuna’s understanding. He didn’t understand what Krishna told him. What did Krishna say? Performing karma (action) supported by the knowledge of atma (soul) is good. This will remove pra:chi:na va:sanas (past tendencies). This is what He [Krishna] said. But Arjuna didn’t absorb “supported by the knowledge of atma (soul)”. “Without that knowledge, karma (action) is a far shot.” This is what was mentioned. But Arjuna understood that karma (action) is a far shot, so it is not required. What did Krishna say regarding vyavasa:thmika: budhdhi (resolute intellect)? Performing karma (action) focusing your mind on the targeted goal will elevate you. He did not understand karma (action) as a means to elevate. He only understood that a focused mind is needed. So buddhi (knowledge) is good and karma (action) is bad. This is what Arjuna understood!\nWith this knowledge, Arjuna questioned Krishna in chapter 3.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\narjuna uva:cha\njya:yasi: che:th karmanas the: matha: buddhir jana:rdana!|\nthath kim karmani gho:re: ma:m niyo:jayasi ke:sava! ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nArjuna said: If, O Janardana, you consider intellect superior to action, then why do you engage me in this terrible action, O Keshava?\n-----------------------------------------------\nLet’s understand the question and move forward.\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of gurus)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nWe are entering the 3rd chapter of Bhagavad Gita, named “Karma Yoga (path of action).” It begins with a question from Arjuna. Arjuna questioned in the first two verses. It's customary to refrain from sharing information about good things unless specifically asked.\nna aprushtaha kasyachith bru:ya:th (one should not speak unless asked)\nIf you inform someone without their asking, then it is not valued as much. When someone inquires, that means there is curiosity. When revealed to such a seeker, he will listen attentively to satiate the curiosity. Therefore, there is a rule that Vedanta (end of the Vedas, philosophical system) is to be disclosed only when specifically asked for. Arjuna asked Sri Krishna initially and again in the 2nd chapter during the explanation of the state of sthita prajna (person of steady wisdom).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsruthi viprathipanna: the: yada: stthasyathi nischala: |\nsama:dha: vachala: buddhihi thada: yo:gam ava:psyasi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen your intellect (buddhi), which is bewildered by the Vedic texts, becomes steady and unmoving in contemplation, then you will attain yoga (union).\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou need two types of buddhi (intellect/understanding) - achala (unmoving) and nischala (unwavering). Krishna said you need to possess these two. Arjuna really liked this. Buddhi (intellect) will turn stable (sthita) if it is nischala (unwavering). We need good buddhi (intellect), so it becomes prajna (wisdom), which turns to sthita prajna (person of steady wisdom).\nArjuna asked for a response immediately as to how a sthita prajna (person of steady wisdom) is? What does he do, how does he talk? “I want to check if I belong to that category or not. If so, I can also leave this war and turn towards that.” In response to Arjuna’s question, Krishna explained the four different stages. And said folks in all these four stages, always do their duty.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyas sarvathra:nabhisne:haha thath thath pra:pya subha:subham\nna:bhi:nandathi na dve:shti thasya prajna: prathishttitha: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe who is without attachment everywhere, who neither rejoices in obtaining good nor hates obtaining evil, his wisdom (prajna) is firmly established.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe does the duty and there will be results, yet he stays unconcerned about them. Thus [Krishna] consistently emphasizes matters concerning performing duty. Concluding, he even says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pu:ryama:nam achala prathishttam samudram a:pah pravisanthi yadvath |\nthadvath ka:ma: yam pravisanthi..\nSLOKA MEANING -\nJust as the waters enter the ocean, which, though ever being filled, remains unmoving and firmly established, so too desires enter the person...\n-----------------------------------------------\nBy taking an example of an ocean, He said, a sthita prajna (person of steady wisdom) also performs duty and he also reaps results. At first, He mentioned that buddhi (intelligence), intelligence, is paramount - He said we need nischala buddhi (unwavering intellect) and achala buddhi (unmoving intellect). And that we should do that alone.. He was talking about buddhi (intellect) all along. But then, why is He mentioning karma (action) again at the end? Even in the last verse he says,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:sha: bra:mhi: sthithih pa:rttha! nainam prapya vimuhyathi |\nsthithva:: sya:m anthaka:le::pi bra:mha nirva:na mruchchathi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is the brahmi sthitih (state of Brahman), O Partha! Having attained this, one is not bewildered. Remaining in this state even at the hour of death, one attains brahma nirvana (liberation in Brahman).\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe called it as brahmi sthitih (state of Brahman), meaning he is asking us to perform karma (action). At first, He said buddhi (intellect) is better. Now, He is asking to perform karma (action). This is Arjuna’s doubt.\nWhen someone is asking a question, the person who is being asked should not feel that he is being tested. He should be asked so that he feels like answering. It should feel like the one inquiring is passionate about knowing the answer. The inquirer shouldn’t ask as if he is forcing or investigating. Although Arjuna is a good person, the way he is inquiring is somewhat surprising, which makes us ponder why he is asking in such a way. Look at the verses that are in the beginning of chapter 3..\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nArjuna uva:cha\njya:yasi: che:th karmanas the: matha: buddhir jana:rdana!|\nthath kim karmani gho:re: ma:m niyo:jayasi ke:sava! ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nArjuna said: If, O Janardana (Krishna), you consider intellect (buddhi) superior to action (karma), then why, O Keshava (Krishna), do you urge me to engage in this terrible action (karma)?\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is the question.\njya:yasi: che:th karmanaha (if it is superior to action)\nkarmanaha (more than the karma, which is performed)\nbuddhihi (knowledge)\nthe: matha: (in your mind)\njya:yasi: che:th (if at all it is great)\nthath kim karmani gho:re: (the one which is insignificant, far away and inferior)\nkarmani (the performance of karma)\nThat too it is so disagreeable, so much work, such chaos, also diverting us in different directions,\nkim karmani gho:re: ma:m niyo:jayasi (Why are you pushing me to perform such karma?)\nHe didn’t stop there. He went into a harsher state.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvya:misre:na iva va:kye:na buddhim mo:hayasi:va me:\nthad e:kam vada nischithya ye:na sre:yaha a:pnuya:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWith seemingly confusing words, you are bewildering my intellect (buddhi). Therefore, tell me decisively that one path by which I may attain the highest good.\n-----------------------------------------------\nvya:misre:na iva va:kye:na (The words which cause restlessness and confusion.)\nbuddhim mo:hayasi:va (It feels as though you are confusing me.)\nAlthough Arjuna is talking cautiously, because of anger, his words are sounding accusative.\nbuddhim mo:hayasi:va (It feels like you are accusing me.)\nthad e:kam vada (Please don’t combine this and that, tell me in such a way that it is not confusing,)\n…and such that I don’t have to think twice about it.\nnischithya ye:na sre:yaha a:pnuya:m (After you brief me, I don’t have to evaluate if it is this or that. And I should be able to receive the appropriate benefit.)\nIn olden days, when classes were conducted in person, not online… When students actually went to the teacher for classes in person… In those days, the teacher would teach lessons to students, then assign them practice at home, called ‘homework.’ In modern days, homework is not recommended! Whatever needs to be taught needs to be done at school itself. Whether you make them memorize or anything else, it all needs to happen only during class. Once they leave the classroom, the student is not supposed to touch this subject! This is the new approach. This is actually not new, it’s what Arjuna asked. He requested, “this is the type of class I want.”\nthad e:kam vada (Don’t confuse me and say some of this and some of that. Just tell me the conclusive essence. Just tell me only that.)\nnischithya ye:na aham sre:yaha a:pnuya:m (It should be in such a way that it dispels my illusion, allowing me to affirm your statement and effectively implement it to reap the benefit.)\nArjuna asks “why are you confusing me in so many different ways?” When someone asks in such a manner, even those who are willing to share may hesitate to do so! They might say, “Your wish, go study wherever you want.” “Go! Why should I teach you?”\nIn Ramanujacharya’s history, there is someone named Thirumalai Aandan. When he was learning the commentary of Thiruvaimozhi, Ramanujacharya used to say, “Swami, it might be better if you teach it by correlating like this instead.” For this only, guruji used to get angry and say, “if you had to interpret it yourself, why do you need me?” The guru stopped teaching the lessons to him. After that, the noble Goshti Purna arrived there and said… “Whatever Ramanuja said is correct.” “I remember our guru, Yamunacharya, teaching it exactly the same way.” After hearing both versions, he affirmed that whatever Ramanuja interpreted is accurate and said, “We are just fortunate that we get to teach Ramanuja.” “We are just lucky that we are his gurus. Ramanuja is not any ordinary person.” “Ramanujacharya is the noble one who came to uplift the entire world.” “He is Yamunacharya’s ekalavya disciple.” “He is only coming to abide by the protocol of the scriptures.” He is not coming to us because he doesn’t know, or because of his ignorance. You reap good results only if you listen via a guru. The knowledge you get from a guru is the only knowledge which is worthy.\nsa:ishtam pra:path (Only to make this true, he is coming to us. It is our fortune.)\n“Let’s teach him well and uplift ourselves. Therefore, do not stop the lessons.” Thus, Goshti Purna encouraged Maladharadhira to teach Ramanuja.\nWhat did Ramanuja say? “You are explaining one way, but it might be better like this or that.” Here is an example. Whenever I am listening to or saying God’s name, I feel like I am drinking honey, milk, sugar, kalakand. If we drink honey separately, it is good. Freshly drawn milk is very tasty, right? Jaggery is also tasty, right? Similarly, just like all these are tasty individually, God’s name is also tasty. Once Ramanujacharya listened to this, he said… “This is good, however, mix honey in milk, add kalakand and others in that mix.” “Why can’t we relate it to the enjoyment of taste in that combination?” It’s impossible to reject this. Honey is good, but after a few drops it is astringent in taste and we don’t feel like drinking it, though it is sweet. The same goes for jaggery. This is in olden days. Now it is difficult to eat that as well. Amrutham (nectar of immortality) was obtained by God churned out a small vessel of it for devatas (demigods). Even today, it is not depleted. Nobody knows how much has been consumed, as we don’t know how many devatas (demigods) exist. But it seems it is not a tasty drink. Thus, each item might taste great. However, enjoying it after mixing them all together…\nKennum, thenum, palum, kannalum, amudam, uththe: (Honey, milk, jaggery, sugar, and nectar)\nWhatever is the taste of enjoying the drink after mixing all the items together… God’s name gives such a taste! We can say that this is how alwar (saint) might have felt. It sounded nice, however, he was denied. Guru thought, “Hm, self-preaching. Okay, whatever!” Guru thought that Ramanuja was trying to be one-up on him! But he didn’t comprehend how well Ramanuja interpreted the essence. Even when asking humbly, if Guru thinks it is outside of his teaching, he is angered. But in Arjuna’s case, he asked…\nthath kim karmani gho:re: ma:m niyo:jayasi (Why are you pushing me to do this horrible karma?)\nIn addition, he said…\nvya:misre:na iva va:kye:na buddhim mohayasi (I feel like you are deceiving me with your confusing statements.)\nI am getting lost. Just properly tell me what one good thing is. Does anyone share if asked this way? However, this is how Arjuna asked! God has more love for us than any mother. God wants our well-being more than any father. God is a better well-wisher than any Guru who wants us to be uplifted. He is hitaishi (well-wisher). Therefore, he thought, at least somebody simply asked, which itself is really great! It’s okay! It seems like he didn’t understand well, so let’s teach him again so it can be understood better. So, He received the question favorably. [Arjuna] asked in an accusing tone. However, [Krishna] took it in a way when someone asks inquisitively. How does someone ask with inquisitiveness? Let’s learn about this and move forward.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of gurus)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nWe have now entered Chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita. The chapter starts with Arjuna’s question.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, grants all wealth, and delights the world.)\n-----------------------------------------------\nHis question in verse one is as follows.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\njya:yasi: che:th karmanas the:\nmatha: buddhir jana:rdana! |\nthath kim karmani gho:re: ma:m\nniyo:jayasi ke:sava! || BG 3.1\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(If, O Janardana, according to You, intellect is superior to action, then why do You engage me in this dreadful action, O Kesava?)\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna is asking Sri Krishna a question in this verse. Krishna!\n`the: matha:` (According to You)\n`karmanaha buddhihi jya:yasi che:th` (if intellect is superior to action in the attainment of self-realization),\n`thath kim karmani gho:re: ma:m` (then why would one perform an action that is heinous and results in grief and fear?)\nWhat is the fear about? The goal is to realize the Self. Whatever obstructs one from realizing the soul causes fear. Therefore, engaging in work is dreadful.\n`ma:m kim niyo:jayasi,` (Why are You encouraging me to take up such dreadful action?)\n`Kes:ava:` (tell me, Krishna)\nKrishna had actually articulated this clearly in Chapter 2. What did He say?\n`buddhi` (steady right knowledge), also called `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge).\nKrishna never said that action is inferior to wisdom or that wisdom is superior to action. However, `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge) is essential. This results in `a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra` (self-realization). And `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge) is attained by performing action. That is, when actions are performed devoid of any attachment with them and desire on outcomes, they generate `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge). And with such `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge), self-realization results. This is what He said.\nOne is neither inferior nor superior to the other. First comes performing `asanga karma` (action without attachment), action performed without the feeling of ‘mine’. With that `asanga karma` (action without attachment), proper intellect shapes up resulting in `sthittha prajnatha` (state of steady knowledge). `Sthitha prajnatha` (state of steady knowledge) is called `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge). With action one must attain `jna:na` (wisdom). With `jna:na` (wisdom), one must attain self-realization. However, `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge) is closer to self-realization, while performing action is relatively far away. This is what He said, not that one is superior or inferior to the other. Without action, the intermediate stage of `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge) will not occur whatsoever. So, for `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge), action is the foundation. And for self-realization, `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge) is the foundation.\nThe Wise mention `avyavahitha pu:rvam` (immediately next to or prior to). For self-realization, `avyavahitha pu:rvam` (immediately prior to) is the `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge). And the one prior to it is `karma nishtta` (steady action). This is what Krishna said. But that is not how Arjuna understood. He (mis)interpreted the one [action] that is distant as being horrible. And the one that is close by as the only essential one. Therefore Arjuna put forth his query thus. ‘You say intellect is superior and action is horrible…’ Arjuna spoke incorrectly about Krishna’s statement. In fact, Krishna didn’t say that.\n‘…why are You encouraging me to take it up?’, Arjuna asked.\nHere, Arjuna addressed Krishna with two different names. One is Kesava and second is Janardana, are the two names he used for Krishna. Arjuna’s words indicate that he feels Krishna to be favorable and a `hithaishi` (well-wisher). Why? Janardana means the One who removes the pain of people. It also means the One who resolves the shortcomings of people. ‘You are supposed to address any limitations I have. You are supposed to remove any ignorance I possess. Being such a person, why are You doing this to me?\nAlso, You are known as Kesava. What does Kesava mean? It is made up of the words `ka:` (ka), `esha` (esha), `va` (va). There are many meanings to the word Kesava. `Ka` (ka) means, in the water; `se:the:` (slept), the one who slept. That is one meaning for Kesava. Kesava also means One with beautiful, curly hair. While praying to Krishna, we chant `kutila:laka samyukhtam` (adorned with beautiful curly hair). His beautiful `kuntalam` (hair curls), tends to fall on his forehead in curvy waves…, due to which He has an exquisite face… is another meaning of Kesava. It also means One who has distinctive hair locks.\nThere is one more meaning to it. There was a demon named `Ke:si` (Kesi). He once came in the disguise of a horse. He is also known as `Aswa:sura` (Ashwasura). Disguised as a horse, he approached with an intent to hurt Krishna. According to `Bha:gavatham` (Bhagavatam), Krishna thrust his hand into the demon’s mouth and tore him apart. Since he killed `Ke:si` (Kesi), He came to be known as Kesava. `Kesi: hantha:` (killer of Kesi), one who killed Kesi.\nIn addition to these, according to `Bha:gavatham` (Bhagavatam) in `Hari vamsham` (Hari Vamsham), there is another definition of Kesava given by Lord Parama Shiva. Sri Krishna once made a journey to Kailasa. There Lord Shiva introduced Krishna to everyone. How? Lord Shiva says –\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nKa iti brahmano: na:ma:\nI:so:ham sarva dehina:m\nA:va:m tavange: sambhu:tou\nThasma:th kesava na:mava:n ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(Ka is the name of Brahma. I am Isa, the controller of all embodied beings. Both of us have emerged from Your body. Therefore, You are known as Kesava.)\n-----------------------------------------------\nSpeaking to `Bhagava:n` (God), Lord Shiva says, `Ka iti brahmano: na:ma` (four-headed Lord Brahma is known by the name ka).\n`I:so:ham sarva dehina:m` (I am the One who governs all). I am the One who takes the `ji:va` (soul) away from here. No one willingly leaves their home [earth]. Even if they are weak, sick, have infections and unable to carry on with their lives, they still do not like to leave [this body]. They wish they could survive another 2 or 3 days. They would keep saying, ‘Hey Doctor! I will give anything. Cure my disease and make me capable of eating a bit’ … but, they are not inclined to leave this place. [Lord Shiva says] “When `ji:va’s` (soul's) time is up however, I am the One who takes control and takes him out of this place. My name is therefore, `I:sa` (Isa) and `Ni:yantha` (Controller). `Ka:` (Ka) is Brahma and `I:sa` (Isa), Me have both emerged from your body. We belong to You. Therefore Your name became `Ka: I:sa: Va:n` (Ka Isa Van), Kesava. This was mentioned by Lord Parama Shiva himself.\nYou are therefore the source of creation, sustenance and dissolution. You are Kesava. Why are You undertaking the creation, sustenance, and dissolution? Only so that these `ji:vas` (souls) can be rid of their `ka:rmic bondage` (karmic bondage). There is no benefit otherwise for You to create this universe. There is nothing You would gain from them. There is nothing in this universe that You do not have and that they can earn by themselves and give it to please You. Because everything we cherish in this universe is given by You. You do not do anything with bias or lack of compassion. Therefore, in my case too, You will not have any bias or lack of compassion.\nNot just once, but You created this universe countless times. Why do You do the creation so many times, even when no one recognizes You for it or expresses gratitude? Does anyone say ‘Thank you’ to God, for such a beautiful creation and making a space for one here? No one acknowledges it, even by mistake! Instead one says, ‘I created all this. I bought all of this [land]. I planted this orchard all by myself. I worked hard to grow these fruits!’ Did he really grow those fruits? He can at best grow filth [in society], but nothing else! Those fruits were borne by the trees, definitely not by him! No one can do anything by themselves in this universe. Only God can make things happen. Even though everyone is shrouded in arrogance, do not thank You and are at the verge of destroying it… You ignore all that and keep trying to create this universe several times. Why? Because You are a `kri:shi: vala` (farmer). You are like a nice farmer. What is Your nature? Wishing for the welfare of all. It does not matter what they can do or will do. But You keep giving them numerous chances, by creating this universe several times, without getting annoyed or taking a break.\nYou, being so compassionate, should guide me in a way that uplifts and does not push me into `ka:rmic bondage` (karmic bondage). However, what are You doing now? You are driving me into `ka:rmic bondage` (karmic bondage). You said I’ll need to attain self-realization. You spoke highly about the soul and that it is eternal, cannot be destroyed and one that should be attained. To attain such a great soul, You said we need `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge). To realize `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge), one must first possess `karma nishtta` (steady action). When will one get `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge)? After reaching the state of `karma nishtta` (steady action). When will one reach `karma nishtta` (steady action) state? By performing an activity with no attachment or desire to its outcomes.\nPoor Arjuna here took a misstep. He thought to get `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge), one must have `sarve:ndriya uparathi` (withdrawal from all senses)… that is, when one withdraws from all the senses. Therefore, he thought, that the soul realization happens once the activities are withdrawn by all the senses. However, doing action is an activity done by all the senses. These two are entirely opposite. If one withdraws senses, he can attain `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge), but if one makes them work then that results in `karma nishtta` (steady action). [Arjuna said], “How can I decipher that `karma nishtta` (steady action) is the tool to attain soul realization? Why are You making me do this action?” This is a case of misunderstanding. While Krishna was comprehensive in His explanation, Arjuna took only a part of it. He should have understood holistically. He only grasped the part he liked, the rest he ignored.\nSometimes people converse with others via their earphones. They only listen to the speaker occasionally when they feel like it, at other times they remove the earphones. If the person on the other end screams at him, he would just remove the earphones. He doesn’t listen to what the other person is saying anymore as he removed those earphones. Arjuna is in a similar state now. He is not focusing on what he thinks he does not need. In reality Krishna conveyed what type of action leads to `jna:na nishtta` (steady knowledge). Arjuna did not ponder in his mind on what ‘type’ of action it should be. He said that [action] results in `a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra` (realization of soul). What He explained was all great.\nArjuna says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvya:misre:na iva va:kye:na\nbuddhim mo:hayasi:va me: |\nthad e:kam vada nischithya\nye:na aham sre:yaha a:pnuya:m || BG 3.2\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(With seemingly conflicting words, You appear to confuse my intellect. Therefore, tell me decisively that one path by which I may attain the highest good.)\n-----------------------------------------------\n`vya:misre:na iva va:kye:na` (words used were interspersed with one another)\n`buddhim mo:hayasi:va` (appear to confuse my mind)\nIf Arjuna had said ‘confuse’ [instead of ‘appear to confuse’], Krishna would have done something so he wouldn’t ever speak again that way. Arjuna said, ‘It appears to me that You are deluding me’. Therefore…\n`e:kam vada` (tell me one thing that is not conflicting and confusing)\n`nischithya` (firmly)\n`ye:na sre:yo::ham` (by which I may attain benefit)\n`nischithya` (firmly) must be included with line that follows, not with the verse’s previous line, it is not `thad e:kam vada nischithya` (You decide something and tell me that). God doesn’t need to finalize anything new today. Everything that is right is already established. Who needs to make a decision is this ‘great’ person [Arjuna].\n`nischithya aham sre:yaha a:pnuya:m` (tell me that which I can firmly accept and that which benefits me).\nArjuna is partly praising and partly criticizing God. For his sake, it is criticism. However, to ensure it doesn’t anger Him, Arjuna questions Him as if praising Him. Let us see how Krishna answers that.\nVande Guru Paramparam!\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 3,
    "episode": 11,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nThe first two verses of Bhagavad Gita’s third chapter comprise Arjuna’s question. The rest of the chapter contains Sri Krishna’s answer. The name of the third chapter is Karma Yogam (Yoga of Action), to learn how to do karma (action). Arjuna had a question about karma acharana (performance of activity). The meaning of karma acharana (performance of activity) is the performance of an activity. To perform an activity, everything in our body must be involved in it. It means, eyes must see, hands and legs must move, brain must function. It requires many tasks to be done. Therefore, karma (action), an activity, happens while involving the senses.\nArjuna [mis]construed that, ‘activity involving senses’ contradicts ‘jnana nishtta (steadfastness in knowledge)’. [To him] jnana nishtta (steadfastness in knowledge) entails withdrawing senses from all the activities [we do] and focus clearly on and work towards atma sakshatkaram (self-realization). (He thought) Atma sakshatkaram (self-realization) is attained after withdrawing the senses whereas Karma nishtta (steadfastness in action) occurs when the senses are working. Therefore, his question was, ‘How can karma (action) be a means to attain jnana (knowledge)?’\nHowever, Sri Krishna had said earlier, that bodies with an acting jiva (individual soul), i.e. a human being, never sits idle. The body needs to be working. However, that work must be done knowing that it is for Him. He never said to stop work, but it should be done for Him. Work done this way not only results in no new karmic (related to action) bondage but also eliminates bonds of past karma (actions) and ensures that one attains atma nishtta (steadfastness in the soul). Therefore karma nishtta (steadfastness in action) is actually the necessary means to gain jnanam (knowledge) and jnanam (knowledge) will help reach atma sakshatkaram (self-realization), He said this.\nHaving not clearly understood this, he [Arjuna] was referring to the same and said, buddhim mohayasi iva (You seem to be confusing my intellect). He used a beautiful word, iva (it seems). It appears to me like You are confusing me, however, You are Kesava (one who has beautiful hair or slays the demon Keshi) and so You don’t do that. You are the one who thinks it’s enough if at least one person gets the benefit of all that you do: creation, sustenance and absorption. So why would You delude me? You will not think like that. However, I might be deficient in understanding what You conveyed. You are Janardana (one who rids people of their faults and fulfills their needs), the One who rids those who surrendered of their faults and fulfills their needs. You will therefore not guide me with what is wrong. You would not gain anything from it. There is nothing wrong or incomplete in what You said. You are not misleading anyone. Whatever You said must have been accurate. But I seem to have misunderstood it due to my lack of understanding. I am deluded. Instruct me on how to clear this misunderstanding.’ He [Arjuna] asked.\nGod is compassionate. He patiently began to reiterate with more clarity. A capable teacher never assumes that the pupil learns everything from the initial lesson. If the pupil does not understand, then the teacher repeats it 10 times until he learns properly. In our childhood, teachers used to make us write the alphabet. Today too, of course. At first, they would write the alphabet on the slate. Then they would hold our hand, point the chalk towards it and repeat those letters 10 times verbally. We would repeat after them only once or twice. Even when we repeat it just once or twice, our mom or dad or the teacher are elated that we are pronouncing it very well. They are the ones who put in the real work, but give credit to their little child. Among all such gurus (teachers), He [Sri Krishna] is the first guru (teacher). He is also the jagad guru (universal teacher). We say, Krishnam vande jagad gurum (I bow to Krishna, the universal teacher).\nHe realized Arjuna had not grasped what was conveyed. He understood that he had perceived something else in his mind. Therefore Bhagavan (God) thought He needed to clarify in detail. Sri Krishna began to explain from Verse 3.\nsri bhagavan uvacha (The Blessed Lord said)\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nlokesmin dvividha nishtta\npura proktha mayanagha! |\njnana yogena sankhyanam\nkarma yogena yoginam || BG 3.3\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn this world, O sinless one, I previously declared two paths: the path of knowledge for those who seek understanding, and the path of action for those who perform their duties.\n-----------------------------------------------\nasmin loke (in this world)… in this world… dvividha nishtta pura maya proktha (a two-fold steadfastness was declared by Me before)… stable decisive knowledge that must exist in a human, I said… dvividha (of two types)… is of two types. However, the goal for these two types is the same. Describing in two ways does not mean there is a difference in the goal. However, I divided the existing means in two ways. dvividha proktha (declared as two types) I told you this clearly. Who did I tell this to? maya anagha (by Me, O sinless one) I said this and I said this to you. In reality, you are not deficient. You are an obedient one and are not at fault. However, your mind temporarily lost the ability to understand. I am the One who is teaching you.\nThere are various types of authorities in this world. [Similarly] Everyone does not start attending 10th grade at the outset. Some start in the 1st class. A few others start in 5th or 8th or 9th or 10th class. Everyone gets taught according to the class they sit in. Let's say, we go to a market to purchase a type of bracelet. Several options are found there. Bracelets made of plastic, clay, copper or gold. Gold bracelets are called simha lalata (lion's forehead, a type of ornament). Why can’t they sell just one type of bracelet that suits all? Different types are available for sale based on affordability, taste, ability. One may have the capability to purchase [a gold bracelet]. Despite that he might choose a regular bracelet instead of a gold bracelet. Some might not have the resources to buy [a gold bracelet]. Still they might desire to wear gold and show off, hence spend their hard earned income to purchase a gold one. To cater to such a customer’s desires, there are also options that look like gold, commonly called 'rolled-gold’. Some wear such jewelry so they feel like they are wearing real gold and show it off. We observe some people in this world… they adorn themselves with rings on all their fingers, jewelry covering their hands and neck. The weight of those ornaments itself would be between 2 to 3 kgs. We are unsure who he is trying to show them off to, but he wears them all and roams around! Without taking a closer look we cannot make out if those are real gold made or simply gold plated ones. However, to enjoy his possessions, to show off and make an impression on others, he puts them on. He is also a possessor. His desire must be fulfilled. A common man’s desire must also be fulfilled. Therefore, the market displays options for all.\nEven in the case of vegetables, there are some that just arrived fresh [into the market]. After some time, a few damaged ones get left over at the bottom of the pile. The fresh ones are useful for some, whereas the damaged vegetables are useful to others. Therefore, no items in society go to waste. However, the consumers vary. Different people acquire different things. Similarly, types of mumukshus (seekers of liberation), those that seek knowledge, differ. Why is He giving this discourse? For whom? Not for anyone out there, but for the mumukshus (seekers of liberation). ‘I want to get better and elevate myself from the current state to a higher state.’ It is for the one who has this bhavana (feeling or intention), thought. Atma tattva (the truth of the soul) is the highest, indestructible, and eternal. Atma tattva (the truth of the soul) belongs to Paramatma tattva (the truth of the Supreme Soul) which runs it. He began upadesa (teaching) to impart this jnana (knowledge). However, He must also keep delivering [teachings] that are useful to everyone in the world.\nWho is the one sharing such knowledge? He is not an ordinary person. Bhagavan (God), says maya (by Me) and pointed to Himself. God is naturally omniscient (all-knowing). He is omnipotent (all-powerful). Meaning there is nothing He cannot achieve. He is all powerful. He is known to be karuna varunalayam (an ocean of compassion). Karunyam (compassion), one who cannot bear to see the pain of others, feels it as his and therefore wants to pull them out of their pain so he is pain-free. The quality of that person is called karuna (compassion). He [God] is like the source and ocean of that karuna (compassion). Therefore, He will teach only that which is necessary for [attaining] the greatest purushartha (purpose of human life).\nAdditionally, teachers, while speaking, may be at fault in four different ways. They are bhrama (illusion), pramada (carelessness), vipralambha (deception), asakthatha (incapability). Some might have all four faults, while others may have one or two or more. Misunderstanding one for another is called bhrama (illusion). Not recognizing the knowledge of things as they are, out of carelessness is called pramada (carelessness). It is a Sanskrit term. These are bhrama (illusion) and pramada (carelessness). Vipralipsa (intention to deceive) is to intentionally misguide someone. To enforce one’s opinion on others and deprive them of the right knowledge so they are misguided is called Vipralipsa (deception) [Vipralambha (deception)]. That is called vipralipsa (deception) [or vipralambha (deception)]. Asakthatha (incapability) is the incapability of expressing what we know, despite knowing it. We know what sweetness is. However, we cannot differentiate the sweetness in various types of desserts. Gulab jamun is sweet, mysore pak is sweet, jilebi is sweet, janghri is sweet and so is bundi. Yet, we cannot tell the difference in sweetness between them all. We know they are sweet however. We cannot even speak about what sweetness is. This is called Asakthatha (incapability). Not able to explain about things we know. Vipralipsa (intention to deceive) is acting as if one knows something when in reality one doesn’t. Pramada (carelessness) is not paying attention to a subject despite its existence. Bhrama (illusion) is misunderstanding one for another. For instance, we imagine our body to be ourselves. This is called bhrama (illusion).\nGod does not have these! [Sri Krishna said] “I do not have these!” Even Arjuna is aware that Sri Krishna is devoid of faults such as bhrama (illusion) and pramada (carelessness). Sri Krishna therefore said, “maya proktha puranagha (declared by Me before, O sinless one):” ‘I am the one who earlier spoke about the deserving people.’ dvidha proktha (declared as two types) ‘I spoke about the two types [of deserving people].’ Who are they? jnana yogena sankhyayam (by the Yoga of Knowledge for the Sankhyas) sankhyayam (for the Sankhyas) one who has focus on sankhya (knowledge). We alluded earlier that sankhya (knowledge) refers to atma jnanam (knowledge of the soul). Samyak khyayathe (that which is perfectly known), knowledge that should be attained is the knowledge of soul. Knowledge of the soul is the epitome of all learning! sankhyam (knowledge) refers to that knowledge of the soul. [Sri Krishna continued], Only some can understand it with the help of jnana yogam (Yoga of Knowledge). karma yogena yoginam (by the Yoga of Action for the Yogis), [yoginam (for the Yogis)] those that practice and do their duty with karma (action). Earlier, I mentioned that they must be diligent. I did not confuse you. You did not understand it well. I will elaborate clearly for you now. Sri Krishna began to elaborate on this further in Chapter 3.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)!\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nGenerally, people in the world are at various stages. The same content is grasped differently based on their samskara (imprints), impressions, and qualifications. In Chapter 2, Sri Krishna clearly advised Arjuna on the process of performing duty. However, Arjuna didn’t understand it clearly. Hence, in the beginning of Chapter 3, Arjuna questions, \"You ask me to do karma (actions), but you say buddhi (knowledge/intellect) is superior. Then, you should encourage me to be in jnana nishtta (focused on knowledge). Instead, why are you encouraging me to do karma with this body where buddhi (intellect) gets driven by indriyas (senses)? For sure, it is confusing me!\"\nva:misre:naiva va:kye:na buddhim mo:hayasi: (You are somehow making me lose my focus and confusing me.)\nI feel that You are somehow making me lose my focus and confusing me. Please clarify so that I can make a decision and practice accordingly. He [Arjuna] seeks this clarification in verse 1 and 2. Sri Krishna answers his query. God’s upade:sa (edification/teaching) begins from verse 3 of Chapter 3.\nSLOKA WORD -\nSri: Bhagava:n uva:cha\nlo:ke:smin dvividha: nishtta: pura: pro:ktha: maya::nagha! |\njna:nayo:ge:na sa:nkhya:na:m karmayo:ge:na yo:gina:m || 3\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe Blessed Lord said: In this world, O sinless one, a two-fold path was declared by Me before: the path of knowledge for the Sankhyas (those who analyze the Self), and the path of action for the Yogis (those who perform actions).\n“Whatever I told you in the earlier chapter is not at all confusing, but you misunderstood.” Not all have the same comprehension capabilities. In Chapter 2, I have told precisely what one can do as per one’s practice. However, you couldn’t perceive it properly. Whom did I exempt from practicing karma (action)? Everyone has to do karma (action). That is what I said. Right? Yes, a few are not required to do karma (action).\nSLOKA WORD -\nyasthu a:thma rathire:vasya a:thma thrupthascha ma:navaha |\na:mthanye:vacha samthrustaha thasya ka:ryam na vidyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBut for the person who rejoices in the Self, who is satisfied with the Self, and who is content in the Self alone, there is no duty to perform.\nThe above said is true… Only for those being a jnana nishtta (focused on knowledge) – qualified naturally by birth or by the effect of samskaras (imprints/impressions) or God’s grace. How can we identify such a person? Such a person will have no interest in anything mundane. He will be inclined only towards atma (the Self/soul).\na:thma rathire:vasya (one who rejoices in the Self)\nNot only that, we get satiated when we eat something or drink water or watch something, etc. Yet, no satiation occurs from experiencing the mundane.\na:thma thrupthascha ma:navaha (the person who is satisfied with the Self)\nHe is satisfied only when applying effort in knowing, thinking, listening, or talking about atma (the Self). Only then, he is satiated. He is a:thma thruptha (satisfied in the Self).\na:thma rathihi (interested only in aspects of the soul)\na:thma thrupthascha (finds satisfaction only in aspects of the soul)\nOn the other hand, we may not be happy at times even after a fulfilling experience. However, that person about whom we are talking about is a:thmanye:vacha santhushtaha (experiences joy only with the Self). He experiences joy only with atma (the Self) and nothing else. A person in that state will not have any materialistic needs – he need not toil for food. He doesn’t need to earn money or study or be employed or try to be in the good books of someone for sustenance. Hence, such a person will have no duty to perform.\nthasya ka:ryam na vidyathe: (there is no duty for him to perform)\nBecause such a person needs nothing but experience of atma (the Self), nothing else gives him joy or satisfaction. Only experiencing atma (the Self) encompasses all joy for him. And he strives continuously to experience atma (the Self) and nothing else. Other experiences neither give him satisfaction nor joy. Also, he has no liking for them. Such a person doesn’t need to do karma (action).\nHowever, you are not like that. Why? Because, you are aware of people who are standing in front of you in the battlefield. You don’t want to cause them any harm. You want to satisfy the people standing in front of you. You don’t want to satisfy the atma (the Self). You are feeling that they will suffer if you fight with them. Else, you are feeling that some of them might lose their lives in the battlefield and go to the other worlds. Or, you are feeling that your ancestors in the higher worlds will fall [to the lower planes] due to the misdeeds of the people here. Can you realize the number of ways you are thinking with regard to the mundane world? Notice how your thought process is flowing in that direction. So, there is no a:thma rathi (rejoicing in the Self), a:thma thrupthi (satisfaction in the Self), a:thma samthustti (contentment in the Self) in you. You are not atma (Self) centric at all times. If all these are focused towards atma (the Self) only, then\nthasya ka:ryam na vidyathe: (there remains nothing for him to do)\nBut, it’s highly impossible for any human being to attain that state on this earth. There may be one or two such great souls like Sri Suka Maharshi or Nammalvar. However, it is highly impossible to find such people. For such an individual, there is no need of karma yoga (path of action). He need not achieve anything from it. Because attaining that state implies that all pa:pas or punyas (results of karmas of virtues or sins) are subdued. Implying the underlying factors, rajas and thamas (qualities of passion and ignorance), that provoke them are also subdued. Which in turn implies that sattva guna (quality of goodness) is naturally enhanced. Then, he becomes mentally immune to any external influences. One who has reached this state, doesn’t need to do anything.\nHowever, you have not reached that state. Hence, you must follow whatever is suitable and assigned to you without any lapses.\nlo:ke:smin dvividha: nishtta: (in this world, two kinds of focus/paths)\nOne set of people who have focus on or those whose…\na:thma rathi (interests incline toward the soul)\na:thma thrupthi (satisfaction comes only by aspects of the soul)\na:thma santhushti (joy is experienced only by aspects of the soul)\nThis is one category of people. There might be very few – one or two or three – in that category. What is the other category? Other set of people are those with a tendency to perform activities influenced by the punya and papa karmas (actions of virtue and sin). This is the second category. People in this category have to keep on doing their delegated activities. Their activities are in accordance with the results of pa:pa and punya karmas (actions of sin and virtue). However, one should know the process of how to perform [activities]. This was what was explained in the previous chapter. There is a way to perform [activities] as a service to God. Then, we can erase the mountains of sins entirely.\nasmin lo:ke: (being in this world)\ndvividha: nishtta: (two kinds of focus/paths)\npura: pro:ktha: maya::nagha! (previously, I have already revealed this, O sinless one!) – previously, I have already revealed this to the adhika:ri (one who has eligibility). I know the background of these eligible ones very well. Hence, I definitely give them knowledge of what and how much they need to know. What is the reason?\nmaya: pro:ktha: (for I have revealed)\nfor I am impartial towards all, merciful towards all. Fair towards all. Hence,\nmaya: pro:ktha (it is I who elucidated)\nHow one should be in the beginning stages of karma yoga (path of action). How one should be during the ripening period of karma yoga (path of action). How one is in the totally ripened state of karma yoga (path of action). And how one is who doesn’t require any karma (action).\nnaiva thasya kruthe: na:rttha: (he gains nothing by action)\nna kruthe:na iha kaschana (nor does he lose anything by inaction)\nthasya ka:ryam na vidyathe: (there is no duty for him to perform)\nSuch person will not benefit in any way by doing karma (action) nor will he be at loss otherwise. People in the other category, have to perform karma (action). That is for one type of eligible person and the other is for another type. I have never advised a person to adopt both ways. I never asked any one person to omit and perform karma (action) as both are conflicting statements. One advice is for one who has a certain yo:gyatha (ability/qualification). The other advice is for one who has another yo:gyatha (ability/qualification). That’s what I have explained. That too, I ‘pro:ktha’ (explained/revealed). Whatever I explained, shouldn’t disturb your mind in any way. That is how clearly I told you. The Supreme Lord doesn’t have defects such as\nbhrama (misconception)\nprama:da (lack of concentration)\nvipralipsa (desire to deceive others)\nasakthatha (inability to express what He perceives)\nSo He can very clearly tell what needs to be told. There is nothing that He does not know. I said very clearly. That too, I told you,\nanagha (O sinless one)\nBecause you are a candidate eligible for moksha (liberation). You must work but it is your duty to do work in a manner that doesn’t bind you. As you have that eligibility, I am with you to correct you, elevate you. However, a few are even below that state. So they have to do the work differently. For you the way of doing activities is different. For those better and with mellowed jnana (knowledge), there is a different way of doing. I told you earlier what you have to do as per your stage. What did I say?\njna:na yo:ge:na sa:nkhya:na:m (the path of knowledge for the Sankhyas)\nsa:nkhya:na:m (for those interested in the philosophy of the soul)\njna:na yo:ga (path of knowledge) is for those interested in a:thma thaththva (truth of the soul).\nkarma yo:ge:na yo:gina:m (the path of action for the Yogis)\nyo:gina:m (those who are fit for all types of action) – For such people, their practice should continue with karma yoga (path of action).\npura:pro:ktha: (which was already told long ago)\nI reiterated the same in Chapter 2 clearly.\nbhagavad a:ra:dhana buddhi (the intellect that sees every act as worship to God)\nEvery act when performed as worship to God becomes yo:gam (union with God/spiritual discipline). People who follow it are called yo:gis (practitioners of yoga). I advised you that this is how you should perform your duties. As we proceed with Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna clearly explains the same. Let us learn how He takes us forward with His clarification.\nVande: guruparam para:m (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nEveryone born on the earth has an urge to achieve something. However, to achieve it, you need to do some activity. There is a process to follow for doing the particular activity. Obtaining whatever one wishes for is known as Siddhi (success). That is stated in shastras (scriptures). He acquired siddhi (success) - meaning he was successful in achieving what he wanted. It’s commonly referred to as success. Everyone wants to get siddhi (success).\n“Arjuna, You too want siddhi (success), right?” asked Sri Krishna in chapter 3. Is it desirable? Yes.\nsiddhim vindathi manavaha (any human being can certainly achieve what he wishes for)\nHow?\ntham abhyarcha (Him, the cause of the Universe, while worshipping Him properly)\nsiddhim vindathi (doing so, one can attain success)\nIf you spend all the time in His worship, then what about the worldly duties required to be performed? Lord Krishna never said to stop your worldly duties. He said to do all activities as His worship. In chapter 18 –\nsva karmana thamabhyarcha (whatever work is ordained to a particular person, has to be done)\nFor example, a farmer has to till the land, police must protect, a businessman has to do business. Thus, everyone has a particular duty. Whatever karmas (actions) we are assigned, we should keep performing without fail. If we keep doing karmas (actions), when will we be able to worship Bhagavan (the Lord)? Or, if we are continuously engaged in doing His worship, how can we do our karmas (actions)? Hence, God did not separate them both. He made them both as one.\nsvakarmana thamabhyarcha (Whatever is your duty, keep fulfilling it)\nBut while fulfilling it, think of it as Lord’s worship. What should the underlying feeling be? It says…\ntham abhyarcha (worship Him)\nWho is He? Whom should we worship? The whole world is filled with such questions. There are so many arguments around them. A lot of emotions - anger, frustrations, clashes on this topic. To decide Who is the Actual Cause of this whole Universe, much energy is wasted. When we are asking to worship Him regularly through our karmas (actions), the question arises – Who is He? Is it a HE or a SHE? How do we identify that Cause? To recognize that Cause, what is the Identification? There is always an attribute or a feature through which anything is identified. For example, Oxygen is identified by the O2 molecule. A flower is recognized by its fragrance. Then, what is the identifying factor, ID, for the Cause of this Universe?\nGod answered, yathah pravrutthir bhuthanam ena sarvam idam thatham (from whom all beings have originated, and by whom this whole universe is pervaded).\nbhuthanam (the whole world around us, seen and unseen)\nyathah pravrutthihi (wherever it emerged from)\nena sarvam idam thatham (One who is permeating in each and every particle, One who is pervading and supporting all).\nena sarvam idam thatham (not only that, He permeates, becomes the indweller, and supports each and every atom).\nJust as an engine is inside a vehicle, gives the car an identity, becoming the reason for its movement… God dwells in every particle, sentient or insentient, and controls its existence, sustenance and progress. For such a One, dedicate each and every karma (action) you do. Doing karma (action) is indispensable. But, while doing karma (action), a change in the thinking pattern is required. There is no external change. For example, a farmer must hold the plough, till the land, and cultivate it for a living. These days, using a plough is outdated. However, the same activities are carried on by tractors. He now sits in the tractor, ploughing, sowing seeds, weeding, reaping, packing, etc. That is the farmer’s svakarma (one's own duty). How should he do it?\nthamabhyarcha (feel that as service to God)\nThis is something that should be done with jnana (knowledge). Karma (activity) should always be performed while being backed by jnana (knowledge). What kind of jnana (knowledge)? The knowledge that… Whoever is the Cause of the Universe, by whom the whole universe is created and sustained… Let all my activities be dedicated to Him as His worship only. Nothing different.\nHow can farming become Worship? Worshipping means sitting before the deity, chanting his divine names, offering water, fruits and flowers, lighting lamp, etc. Following all these steps is called worshipping God. Right? Not necessarily. This body is the tool that has been blessed by Him. This body/land has been graced by him, the machine you are using is also only due to His grace. Being alive is also due to His grace. We use our strength with life bestowed by Him, with the tools He gave. Hence, when we dig the earth or till land, we pray… “Oh Mother! Pardon us for hurting you.”\nbhumidara krutam dosham krupaya kshantu marhasi (Oh Mother! Pardon us for hurting you)\nDuring yajnas (sacrifices), the priests do mruth sangrahanam (collecting soil), they dig earth to collect soil for yagna (sacrifice) rituals. While doing so, they pray, “Oh Lord in this form, I am troubling You, causing discomfort.” We are taking some soil for the program. This is also recommended by shastras (scriptures) - how, where, when, how to take the soil. Shastras (scriptures) are Your instructions. Hence, we are doing this trying to follow Your instructions. Hence, praying to Earth before taking the soil - is the rule. While doing so, the Earth is also Lord’s form. He dwells in me. He is in the tools, This farming is for His worship. He blessed a home for me. He is there in that house, blesses me from there and this farming service is His worship.\nIf the thought process is changed thus,\nsva karmanam (one is doing his usual chores in which he is adept)\ntam abhyarcha (offering the same to the indweller, Bhagavan)\nWhoever can do this, he alone - siddhim vindathi manavaha (he alone attains success).\njagat karana srushti, sthiti, laya (creating, sustaining and dissolving the universe)\nyathah pravrutthi bhuthanam ena sarvam idam thatham (from whom all beings have originated, and by whom this whole universe is pervaded)\nSri Krishna mentions only two - creation and sustenance. From whom are these manifested, because of whom these are sustained or nurtured. If these two are accomplished, performed by Him, the third, dissolution is implied. For only after taking them all inside, can He bring them out. He is the jagat karana tattvam (the fundamental cause of the universe) - He is the Cause. He is the one who creates, sustains, and dissolves. You have to do His Upasana (worship or meditation). You have to offer your karma (action) to Him. Thus, God clearly tells us how to do our karma (action).\nThen Arjuna gets a doubt. If we do so, to what form will the karma (action) be transformed? Thus, the karma (action) performed becomes dharma (righteous action).\ndharmena papam apanudati (by righteous action, sin is removed) - Veda says so.\nThe mass of karma (actions) we have accrued all through these births, has to be alleviated only through dharmacharana (by following righteous conduct). The more dharma (righteous action) you practice, the more you will become free from mountains of sinful reactions. It is because of these mountains of sins, our indriyas (senses) are enticed to indulge in various activities. Once sins are exhausted, indriyas (senses) get suppressed and their agitation will cease. Then the rajo and tamo guna (qualities of passion and ignorance) that affect the manas (mind) will deplete a little, and calmness results. Then manasa prasadam (mental peace) will be experienced. Sattva guna (quality of goodness) will rise slowly.\nsattvat samjayate jnanam (from goodness, knowledge arises)\nWith sattva guna (quality of goodness), with a peaceful mind, he gets clarity in the work he does. That is also karma (action). But its name changes. For example when ordinary paper is printed into currency, its value also changes. Also, if we take regular paper and make a special stamped paper, sign and give, its value changes from an ordinary paper. Because it is a qualified paper. Thus, whatever we do is Karma (action). When qualified, then, its name changes and becomes dharma (righteous action).\ndharmena papam apanudati (the dharma we practice will wipe off our karma)\nKarma (action) bestows jnana nishta (steadfastness in knowledge), assimilated and established knowledge of realities, leading to self-realization. Rarely some, as soon as they are born, are focused in jnana nishta (steadfastness in knowledge) and they directly achieve self-realization. Realization of the soul is the sole purpose. Whether through karma yoga (path of action) or jnana yoga (path of knowledge) - it depends on their qualification. That I know! Who is qualified for what! For you, You are qualified for karma yoga (path of action) only.\nkarmany eva adhikaraste (you have the right to perform your prescribed duty)\n“Krishna! Why first do karma (action), then acquire jnana (knowledge), then enlightenment? Why is everyone not blessed with jnana (knowledge) outright?” “Not Possible!” Sri Krishna says in the 4th sloka (verse).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna karmana:m ana:rambha:th\nnaishkarmyam purusho::snuthe: |\nna cha sannyasana:de:va\nsiddhim samadhi gachhathi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNot by abstaining from action does a man attain freedom from action, nor by mere renunciation does he attain perfection.\n-----------------------------------------------\nGenerally, we think that all bondages are a result of the karma (actions) we do. What if we stop doing karma (action) totally? We cannot. Without doing karma (action), how will we sit? Breathing in and out is karma (action). Opening and closing eyes is karma (action). Sleeping and waking is also karma (action). Every activity is karma (action). If we stop doing karma (action), man will not attain naishkarmya siddhi (perfection of freedom from action). Only by practicing karma (action), one has to become nishkarma (free from the reactions of action). How is that? How does that make sense – ‘By practicing karma (action), one is to become free from karma (action)?’ Yes. Sri Krishna says so in the 4th sloka (verse). Let's learn more in the next episodes.\nVande:guru parampara:m\nJai Sri:manna:ra:yana"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, grants all prosperity, and delights the entire world.)\n-----------------------------------------------\nReaching chapter 3, verse 4, Arjuna raised a doubt. In this world, why do some exist as karma nishta (devoted to adhering to duties), while others as jnana nishta (devoted to acquiring knowledge)? Why can’t everyone be the same and have the same capabilities? You are the one who gives these abilities, right? Wouldn’t it be good if everyone was the same?\nThe truth is, it cannot happen that way. Because, before entering the current physical body, the soul traveled through many other bodies. In those bodies, the soul performed different actions. Each deed creates a samskara (record) on him. These are segregated as ruchi (active tendencies) and vasana (latent tendencies). Some of them are active and some are inactive. The active records of karma (actions) are called ruchis. The inactive records of karma are called vasanas.\nFor example, mixing of water and some kind of powder in a big vessel. It is a different story if the powder dissolves completely. Otherwise, water floats and the powder gradually settles down at the bottom of the vessel. Just like the floating water, some records of our deeds are active. And few records settle at the bottom of our manas (mind) just like the heavier substance. These records do not surface easily. But they do exist and yield results at some point. These are named vasanas.\nAccording to psychology, it is said that the variety of knowledge, and whatever we memorize is just the tip of the iceberg. Meaning, what we see is just the top portion of the iceberg and the submerged portion is hundreds of times bigger. Similarly, some of the karma samskara (records of actions) in us remain as ruchis, i.e., can be recollected. This recollection happens anytime. However this happens, without our knowledge, they make us experience the effects of the past karmas (actions) imprinted on us. Either in our consciousness or dreams or suddenly, at random points in time (they surface). These are named ruchis.\nSome reside very deep inside us and stay in low profiles. They emerge suddenly and show their effect. Once they emerge, our sense organs are under their influence. Then these organs develop restless behavior. They start moving and behaving like fluctuating water. It’s like the eyes wanting to see something. Now, they want to do something like the mouth wanting to eat something, the nose wanting to smell something. Ruchi (active tendencies) and vasana (latent tendencies) are the reason behind the restlessness of the sense organs.\nWhat causes these ruchis (active tendencies) and vasanas (latent tendencies)? That is, why do we remember something and not the other? The answer is underlying punya (virtuous) and papa (sinful) forms of our karma (actions). Because of the karma, the respective ruchi (active tendency) or vasana (latent tendency) pops up. These punya (virtuous) and papa (sinful) are because of raga (passion) and dvesha (hatred). Rajo (passion) and tamo (ignorance) gunas (qualities) are the underlying causes for raga (passion) and dvesha (hatred). These must be suppressed first. We cannot get rid of these rajasthamo gunas (qualities of passion and ignorance) because we do not know where they dwell. They exist somewhere inside us.\nAt the end of this 3rd chapter, He said:\nindriya:ni mano:budhihi asyadhistanamuchathe: (These gunas exist at the levels of indriyas, sense organs, manas, mind, buddhi, intellect.)\nThey dwell in their designated places. But we do not know the exact location of sense organs. We know the location of eyes but not of chakshu indriya (the sense organ of sight). We know where the nose exists but not ghrana indriya (the sense organ of smell). We know the location of the tongue but not of rasana indriya (the sense organ of taste). We say that we do not know their whereabouts because sometimes eyes look all right, but the person cannot see. The person can see only if the chakshu indriya (which enables sight) is working fine. The eyeball we see is not the chakshu indriya. In our scriptures, it is said that thathh Krishna tara agravarthi (anterior to the physical eye). Similarly, certain people cannot smell anything despite a ‘long’ nose. Why? Because the buds inside that enable one to smell are destroyed. Once they are regenerated, he regains the sense of smell. This means there is a center that enables the sense of smell. It is called nasa agravarthi (anterior to the nose). Similarly, tongue for the sense of taste and the skin for the sense of touch. The enablers of these senses are called indriyas (sense organs). We cannot see indriyas but we see their releasing entry points. We call them indriyas (senses) in our daily conversations. They are not actual senses, however. There exists somewhere internally a sense organ chakshu indriyam (which enables sight). Residing somewhere here, one that enables hearing is a sense organ called the sravana indriyam (sense organ of hearing). Similarly, ghrana indriyam (sense organ of smell), rasana indriyam (sense organ of taste), tvag indriyam (sense organ of touch). All these are called indriyas (sense organs) and are in their respective positions. Manas (the mind) is also a big storeroom. Buddhi (intellect) is another huge storeroom. Samskaras (records) are present at all these levels. So, their effects are hard to get rid of. If we can locate them, we may be able to wash them off in some way. We cannot locate these indriyas (sense organs), how can we understand the manas (mind) supporting them? How can we understand the buddhi (intellect) which supports the manas (mind)? It is difficult to understand them. Hence, altering our karmic impressions is not humanly possible.\nThen who will do it? The one who has complete knowledge about them. Buddhi (intellect) is again supported by atma (the soul). If the soul wants to do it on its own, it cannot handle and manipulate them. This can be done only by Paramatma (God). Narayana, also called Param Brahma (Supreme Being), is the One who can do this. No one else can do this. For this reason, we must turn each deed of ours into His worship.\nWhat do we desire? First, we want siddhi (success). Next, freedom from all bondages. He named this state of freedom in the 4th verse, naishkarmya dasa (a state of perfected karmas). The state is named by Him as siddhi dasa (state of success). Because ruchi (active tendencies), vasanas (latent tendencies), and samskaras (records) are imprinted only when we perform certain deeds. Sometimes we may think – what if we do not perform any action? Then we stop working. Naishkarmya siddhi (perfection in action) cannot be obtained by not working.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna karmaṇa:ma na:rambha:th naiṣhkarmyaṁ puruṣhaha asnuthe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(A human does not attain naishkarmyam (perfection in action) by abstaining from work at the very start.)\n-----------------------------------------------\nPurushaha (human) naishkarmyam (completing karma, work). But not a state of no karma (no action). One who perfectly completes all his karma (actions) will attain naishkarmya siddhi (perfection in action). Naishkarmyam asnuthe: means he will attain naishkarmyam (perfection in action). How will he attain by not working? He will have a desire for siddhi (success). What does this mean? For example, a person is standing on a riverbank and wants to reach the other side. How will he go? Will he reach by meditating that he must go to the other side of the bank? No. Wishing alone will not help him reach the other side. How will he get there? He must work for it. When he completes his task (perfectly), he will reach the other side. What is the task? He must either swim or use some kind of boat or ship. Or he can also use equipment that can fly him across the river to the other side of the bank. He must perform some kind of action. While doing so, he must choose a capable means. If he chooses a stick to go to the other side of the bank, we cannot even imagine the results. If the other side of the bank is his destination, he must pick a means that will surely land him there. But not the one that will drown him in between. If he wants to be nishkriya (not doing anything), he can’t reach the other side of the bank. If one needs to travel between two villages on a bicycle, one must pedal the cycle to reach the other village. He will not reach the other village if he does not touch the bicycle or any other vehicle. If you want the cycle to become your means to take you to the other side of the village, you must learn to ride the bicycle properly and pedal until you reach the other village. That is when you have reached the destination. Therefore, if the person does not do anything, he will not reach his destination. Or if he does not do it the right way, he will not reach the destination. If he finishes only half of the task, then also he will not reach the destination. Only when the person finishes his work properly and completely, will he reach his destination. We know this.\nSri Krishna also conveyed the same in the verse:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna karmaṇa:m ana:rambha:th naiṣhkarmyaṁ puruṣho: snute:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(By abstaining from work at the very start, one does not attain naishkarmyam.)\n-----------------------------------------------\nNaishkarmyam translates to ‘nishkrantha karma yogaha’ (one who successfully finished his tasks). Such a person’s feeling is termed naishkarmyam. One may think that there would be so many obstructions while working towards its completion so why bother to even start it? Or having started, he may think of giving up, upon reaching a certain point.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna cha sannyasana:de:va siddhiṁ samadhigachchhati\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(If he gives up in the middle of something, he will not achieve victory.)\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna asks Arjuna, “Into which category do you fall?” You wish to achieve siddhi (success) and victory – war is the means to achieve it. But you do not wish to fight this war which means you are saying that you do not want to begin your karma (action).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna karmaṇa:m ana:rambha:th naiṣhkarmyaṁ puruṣho: snute:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(You will not attain naishkarmya siddhi (perfection in action).)\n-----------------------------------------------\nBut you began the task by sending a messenger, accumulated your army, decided on the location of war, gathered everyone from both sides, and you blew the conch. Which means you started the task and now you are giving up. You want to give up now.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna cha sannyasana:de:va siddhiṁ samadhigachchhati\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(When you start something, if you give it up midway, not finishing it, you can never achieve victory.)\n-----------------------------------------------\nSo, you must fight this war at any cost. By saying these words, Sri Krishna encourages Arjuna to fight the war and while doing so, turn the karma (action) into yoga (means). Thus, He is taking us ahead.\nVande Guru Parampara (I bow to the lineage of gurus)!\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\napadām apahartāram dātāram sarva sampadām lokābhirāmam śrīrāmam bhūyo bhūyo namāmyaham (I bow again and again to Lord Rama, the remover of dangers, the bestower of all prosperity, and the delight of the world.)\nWe are now in Chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita. Here, Arjuna sought clarifications in a couple of verses. ‘You say jnanam (knowledge) is superior and that karma (action) binds us. Yet, you ask me to only perform karma (action). Karma (action) is that which distracts intellect as senses are put into various activities. Jnanam (knowledge), on the other hand, requires a focused mind devoid of any activity by the senses. These two are mutually opposite. Aren’t they? Instead of asking me to pursue jnana nishta (steadfastness in knowledge), you encourage me to do karma (action). Don’t they contradict each other?’ Arjuna asked.\nSri Krishna responded by saying, ‘Karmas (actions) change based on who performs them.’ We learned that there are generally three types of karmas (actions). Some karmas (actions) are known as nithya karmas (daily actions), some are naimitthika karmas (occasional actions), and others are kamya karmas (desire-driven actions).\nDaily activities needed to survive are categorized as nithya karmas (daily actions). Activities such as waking up, bathing, dressing, eating food, and other activities needed to keep the body in control are called as nithya karmas (daily actions).\nThere are also karmas (actions) known as naimitthika karmas (occasional actions). Those are activities done for specific reasons. Imagine we board a vehicle to travel to another city. We do not do this daily. It’s a karma (action) done for a nimittam (reason). In Telugu speaking families, rice, dal, rasam, curry, pickle, and buttermilk are foods taken daily. It is called nityaharam (daily diet). In North India, they mostly take wheat based food such as rotis, chapatis, pooris, and parathas. That is the daily food consumed. However, there is also naimitthika aharam (occasional diet). It is taken for a nimittam (reason). For instance, during the time of Ugadi, Ugadi pachchadi (Ugadi special dish) is made. That is naimitthika (occasional). It is done for a specific reason. If an elder leaves this world, then their final rites have to be performed. At that time a few items are prepared with urad dal. It is called naimitthika (occasional).\nBesides these nithya (daily) and naimitthika (occasional) karmas (actions), if one prepares or buys certain food to fulfill a desire or consume for fun, then it is called kamya (desire-driven). If he desires to eat an ice-cream, he gets it from a grocery store and eats it. Or if he wants pakodis, bajjis, pooris or something else, then he makes them and eats. It is called kamya (desire-driven).\nSimilar to how food can be categorized as nithya (daily), naimitthika (occasional) and kamya (desire-driven), activities done by humans in life are also segregated into daily (nithya), reason-induced (naimitthika) and desire-based (kamya). Imagine one wants to win a gold-medal or an award. To win that medal, he participated in a walkathon or a marathon. This is called a kamya (desire), a desire. He performs activities to fulfill desires and is able to fulfill some of them as well. Such activity is called kamya karma (desire-driven action).\nSimilarly, scriptures guide on what one must do when he recognizes the inner world, i.e., the mind, atma (soul), and the paramatma (God) within. Such activities are known as scripturally led work and activities. Even in these, there are nithya karmas (daily actions), naimitthika karmas (occasional actions), and kamya karmas (desire-driven actions). A man has to do these three types of karmas (actions). He acquired this body only to perform karma (action). We alluded to the body as a tool earlier. A tool is utilized only when a work can be carried out with it. Therefore, this body is a tool and it must be put to use. How to use it though?\nAssume there is someone to whom this tool and we belong to. He might say, ‘Hey, this is how the tool should be used and for this purpose.’ Then we must follow what He says, as we identify Him as an owner. Who is the owner of this body? Someone who gave a body to us. With limited perception, we can see that this is given by a mother and a father. In reality, even they don’t know how a body is obtained or how it forms, changes or operates. Therefore, they do not have any authority on the body. There is another One situated elsewhere that bestowed it. He provides it to all beings. This substance is His. What about us who indwells within this body? Even we do not have freedom to do whatever we want. We have to act as per how [the body] drives us.\nHow should this tool be used so that it is advantageous to you? How should it be used such that the purpose of human life is fulfilled? What is that? What purpose does gaining a human body have? We are stuck in a wheel without realizing it. It is mostly filled with hardships. Occasionally we do experience happy times. However, they are not significant nor do we remember them. Hardships are always on top of the mind and we live constantly remembering them. We do have varied experiences, whether they are hardships or good times, and not all of them are favorable. This body must be used as a tool to make the situation always favorable. That is what we must do. We must ‘utilize’ it. This needs to be kept in quotations. Utilizing means, it must be made to work. Making it work is called as ‘Karma’ (action).\nIf someone wants to pass a test, he must do a karma (action). What karma (action) must he do? He has to study diligently. Is the act of studying enjoyable? It would be nice if someone shares how a good score can be secured without working hard. Even better if the certificate can be obtained without studying or taking the test to get grades. That is siddhi (accomplishment), an accomplished state. To attain that siddhi (accomplishment), one must first do a karma (action). Whether by referring to a book or not, he must be well versed with the topic in it. What do you mean by ‘with or without referring to a book’? It means, usually while taking a test a book is not used. Answers are written based on the questions given. In some places however, an ‘open-test’ is administered. Open test means you are allowed to use the book for reference while taking the test. It is actually a preferred mode. Do you know why? One must know the book’s contents already to figure out where the answer might be for a specific question. He should have read the book already from beginning to end. He should know where he might find a certain answer or which page covers a certain topic. It’s a good practice to refer to the book to answer the questions. He would have already read through the book and know where each topic is covered. For one that doesn’t have this knowledge, without writing on his own, he would cheat during the test by copying from sheets that others gave, or have someone else take the test on his behalf. Instead of resorting to such bad acts, imagine the proctor hands out the text book along with the question paper and says, ‘You have 3 hours of time. Refer to the book at your convenience and write down appropriate answers.’ That is the best thing. Because he will be able to understand the content and where it is in the book. So, he must have read it. He must have understood that. Isn’t it? [Therefore] One must study well. Studying is a karma (action).\nAfter studying, if he gains knowledge, then he is known to have attained naishkarmya (state of no further action). That is, there is nothing more for him to study or write. He already wrote the test. He is just waiting for the results. He has attained naishkarmya (state of no further action) then. It means, he has put in all the required effort. There is nothing more to be done.\nImagine a cook needing to feed 10 guests. What is his job then? He must cut vegetables, store water, wash utensils, prepare food by mixing accordingly, etc. All of that is a karma (action). When will he attain naishkarmya (state of no further action)? After he has prepared food, he will store it in clean containers and cover them. If the guests still haven't arrived yet, he will relax with the TV or Whatsapp or something else. Then he is known to have attained naishkarmya (state of no further action). Instead if he says, ‘Oh, I will cook if and when they come’. Without turning on the stove and not prepping for cooking, he is not said to have attained naishkarmya (state of no further action). Similarly, if he cooks partially and finds excuses that he dropped food onto the stove, or it overflowed or his hands got burnt, to stop work, then he would not have, i.e., one who stops half-way through his work also has not attained proper siddhi (accomplishment). He is not considered to have accomplished his duty and hence would not have attained siddhi (accomplishment). Siddhi (accomplishment), in the case of a cook, is getting compensated appropriately. When will he get it? Only when the assigned task is accomplished satisfactorily.\nIn the case of a student, if he says, ‘I am unable to comprehend this [book]! It is very hard and has so many pages’. If he stops half-way through reading the book, he will not gain any advantage that is supposed to get. It may be Nithya karma (daily action), Naimitthika karma (occasional action) or Kamya karma (desire-driven action). If any of them are not initiated then naishkarmya (state of no further action) will not be attained. Work must be initiated. Once started it must be completed properly. It must not be abandoned midway through. Such work will not yield any results.\nWhat did Arjuna seek? Atma sakshatkaram (self-realization). That is what he wanted. To achieve it, Arjuna said he wanted to quit war and retire to a remote place to do penance. Let us assume that it is called moksham (liberation). Moksham (liberation) means, any work undertaken should yield no burden nor bondage. It does not mean you should quit your duty. Work embarked on, should not result in more responsibility or bondage. This will not happen by quitting. It will also not happen by failing to initiate it. Activity must be done. This goes for anyone. Irrespective of the state he is in, he cannot stay away from doing activity. Sri Krishna shared at the beginning of this chapter. Anyone that takes birth must recognize his duties and fulfill them. It is not advisable for anyone to ignore his duty, or to quit half-way through. It will not yield any desired results! He says this in verse 4. How can you expect results without doing any activity? Sitting on the ground, if he desires to reach the top floor of a 7-story building, how will he get there? That person will become a laughing stock. [If he says], ‘I will jump from here to there’, everyone will ridicule him. Either take the steps to climb up or use the elevator to go to the top. He must do the activity that he is supposed to do. This is what Sri Krishna is referring to –\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna karmana: mana:rambha:th\nnaishkarmyam purushaha asnuthe:\nna cha sannyasana:de:va\nsiddhim samadhi gachhathi || BG 3.4\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNot by abstaining from action does a person attain the state of no further action, nor does he achieve accomplishment merely by renunciation.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna is guiding Arjuna forward saying that, ‘Ignoring everything but desiring results or victory will not yield yogam (union) or moksham (liberation)’. He is discussing this which we will review further.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBased on what Lord Sri Krishna explained earlier, Arjuna raised a doubt in Bhagavad Gita’s chapter 3, verse 4.\nThe activity one does, whether it is of type nithya (daily), naimittika (occasional), or ka:mya (desire-driven), and experiencing fruits or hardships resulting from that work, by striving to accomplish it or not quitting halfway, why is there a need to do any work at all? Why can’t one be hassle-free and live peacefully somewhere? “I won’t do anything. I won’t act for any reason,” stated Arjuna.\nSri Krishna began to respond in verse 5.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna hi kaschith kshanam api\nja:thu thishttathy akarmakruth |\nka:ryathe::hi avasah karma\nsarvah prakruthijair gunaihi || BG 3.5\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNo one can remain without performing action even for a moment; for everyone is helplessly made to act by the qualities born of nature.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe ji:va (soul) is in the middle with prakruthi (nature) and parama:tma (God) on either side. Prakruthi (nature) is quite enticing, and the ji:va (soul) is with it. Parama:tma (God) is observing him from the other side. Because the ji:va (soul) is engaged with prakruthi (nature), he will perceive various materialistic experiences. It is therefore foolish to assume that he will not be influenced by prakruthi (nature).\nHow does it sound if someone desires not to get wet while sitting waist-deep in water? How ignorant one looks, if they are immersed in neck-deep water but does not want the water to touch or trouble him? Is it smart to expect not getting smeared with grease while sitting on an oil-covered floor? No. How can one expect not to taste sand if he is eating food in a sandy area? If he is sitting on sand, the food leaf is resting on the sand, food is served on it and consumed, then how can one expect not to taste sand? Is it possible?\nYou are in prakruthi (nature). It is comprised of three gunas (qualities) together:\nsatthva (goodness), exhibited in one’s constructive nature\nrajas (passion), exhibited in one’s active and passionate nature\nthamas (ignorance), exhibited in one’s inactive and destructive nature\nThese cause ra:ga (attraction) and dve:sha (repulsion). Due to these ra:ga (attraction) and dve:sha (repulsion), one indulges in various righteous activities and sinful activities, punya karma (righteous actions) and pa:pa karma (sinful actions). The senses move about and act accordingly. You are ‘sitting’ inside these. How ignorant is it to say that I am not related to or I should not be affected by any of these!\nna hi kaschith kshanam api\nja:thu thishttathy akarmakruth |\n...\nkaschith (everyone)\nSri Krishna has not exempted anyone! Anyone that is born into this prakruthi (nature), kshanam api (even for a moment), one cannot stay idle, even for a sub-second, even for the duration of a blink.\nja:thu thishttathy (always remains)\nja:thu (always)\nIn measuring time, imagine the biggest unit there is. A sub-second is the smallest unit. We know that a few sub-seconds add up to a second, a few seconds to minutes, a few minutes add up to an hour, a few hours to a day, a few days to a month, a few months to a year. 4.32 million such years become chaturyuga (4 eons). 1000 such chaturyugas equate to the daytime of Lord Brahma. Another 1000 chaturyugas equate to His nighttime. So, 2000 chaturyugas equal to His full day. Such days make up Brahma’s one year. Those superior to him have their own one-year unit of time in their timeline called para ka:lam (supreme time). The units of time thus range from our sub-second to this paraka:lam (supreme time). Various types of ji:va:s (souls) exist that experience each of these units. There are small microorganisms that have a lifespan in sub-seconds. We humans can experience only seconds, hours, months, and years. Olympic athletes’ performance may be tracked to 100th or 1000th of a second and are rewarded first or second prize accordingly. That is, humans are capable of subdividing time to that level. There may be others such as microorganisms that can experience further smaller units of time. On the other hand, our one year apparently would equate to a day for those in the pitr lo:ka (the world of ancestors). There are those in the realms above them, and there are realms even further above. We alluded earlier that 1000 chaturyuga:s (eons) and another 1000 would equate to a day for Lord Brahma. Such a timeline works for his realm. The timeline here works for our level. The ji:vas (souls) exist from this realm to that. Viswam (the universe) we refer to encompasses all these realms. All of them together are categorized as bhu:thas (beings). No one from these can exist without doing some activity at every moment.\nna hi kaschith kshanam api\nja:thu thishttathy akarmakruth |\n...\nakarmakruth (it is impossible to exist without doing some activity)\nDo you say that everyone does an activity constantly?\nka:ryathe::hi (work continues to get done)\nCan anyone be adamant and not do any activity?\navasah karma (it is not in their control)\nAs alluded to earlier, imagine someone sitting in the path of a large water flow. If he decides not to move, the next big wave can easily blow him off from his place. Some time ago, there were floods [in a city]. So, many parked and secured their cars inside their houses. But the powerful flow of the flooding water swept away the cars, carried them, rammed them into each other, and carried other cars off as well. We’re not sure where they eventually ended up. Primarily, the cars were neither in their own control nor was anyone driving them. The way they got carried away by the water flow, every life or being in this universe, ka:ryathe::hi avasah karma (work will continue to happen through them).\nIs everyone doing an activity constantly?\nsarvah (Yes, everyone!)\nWhy do you say so?\nprakruthijaihi gunaihi (due to the effect of qualities of rajas and thamas formed by prakruthi).\nIn Chapter 18, Sri Krishna mentions this. After listening to the entire Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna says, ‘I won’t do it. I will control prakruthi (nature).’ Lord smiled and said, ‘O! fool, you may be determined about not waging war, prakruthihi tva:m niyo:kshathi (this nature will entice you into doing an activity and you will not be able to resist). You may be forced to wage war then. Be aware! If you follow now, I’ll be next to you for support and help you. Else I will step aside, and the flow of prakruthi (nature) will make you tread in whichever direction it chooses. Then neither you nor anyone else can determine the path it takes.’\nWhy is it so? Only one is able to release us from the bondages of karma (actions) – that is Na:ra:yana (Lord Narayana). Only Bhagava:n (the Lord) is capable. Whoever has His grace, eme:va e:shaha vrunite: the:na labhyaha (He makes it suitable only for those who He is pleased with but not for others). How is one able to please Him? Simply follow His directions. What did He ask of us? As He sent us forth, He assigned certain duties to everyone.\n[For example] A government officer or any employee is sent to another office on a business trip. He will then be expected to accomplish the assigned work in the duration of his visit. If he is unable to complete it in that duration, he can request for an extension of time. If given 3 days, he could ask for it to be extended by another day or two. But the work he was sent to that office to accomplish must be completed. Otherwise, he will not be able to keep that job! This body is like our job. We are situated here [in this body] and working in this job. Since He gave this ‘job’ to us, we should ‘work’ as He pleases. Is it right if you say that you will ‘work’ as per your whims and desires? He [The Lord] will regulate ra:ga (attraction) and dve:sha (repulsion) in us, only when we ‘work’ as per His pleasing. Only when they are regulated, the gunas (qualities) – satthva (goodness), rajas (passion), and thamas (ignorance) – can be controlled. He will reduce rajas (passion) and thamas (ignorance), and ensure the growth of satthva (goodness). Your senses will be in your control, and your activities will go on properly. You do not need to wrestle with them. Let the senses do what they are accustomed to. However, you need to alter the attitude behind the activity.\n… prakruthijaihi gunaihi (due to the qualities born of nature) …\nsarvah (everyone) .. avasah (helplessly)…\n…kriyathe: (is done) …ka:ryathe: (is caused to be done) …\nTherefore, prakruthi (nature) affects everyone. It is the most powerful entity of all. ‘I made the prakruthi (nature) compatible to you and merged it with your body. Along with that, you were assigned some duties as well. [With this body] You now have an opportunity to cleanse all your prior sins, by acting on this duty. Isn’t this a nice thing? Where is the need to give up your prescribed duty? How can you claim to give this up and sit idle? You cannot do that either. Following up on the prescribed duty yields a favorable outcome. If you go against it, you will end up facing hard challenges.’\nHe [Sri Krishna] clarified this concept in the 5th verse. By following His guidance, we get liberated from the heap of sins. Then, the anthahkarana (inner instrument) or manas (mind) becomes nirmala (cleansed of ‘dirt’). A nirmala anthahkarana (cleansed inner instrument) leads to jna:na nishtta (an assimilated and established state of knowledge) that is needed to be attained. We will then achieve that which we are supposed to.\nAs alluded to earlier, we carry samska:ras (impressions) from prior lives. Those, however, cannot be managed by us. We cannot predict when any of those will arise to influence us. We can learn the dynamics of dreams to understand them. We do not need a sa:sthra (scripture) or veda:ntam (Vedanta philosophy) to know about them. While sleeping at night, do we get dreams that we wish for? No, we do not. If one wishes for a dream where he feasts on a sumptuous meal, he might instead get a dream where he is suffering from starvation. If he sleeps wishing for happy dreams, he might have a nightmare where he is lost in a forest with a tiger or a wolf or a lion chasing him, or where he is drowning in a deluge. Do we get dreams as per our wishes? On the contrary, we get quite the opposite. It means, we do not have control on the aspect of dreams in our lives. We are explaining [the topic of dreams] for that reason. We do not have control on whatever is going on inside [the body]. On the external body, however, we have limited authority. We can make it adhere to our wish to some extent. However, activities by mind are not something we can dictate. They follow His order. We will be in a comfortable state if following the path He advises.\nChapter 3, verses 6 and 7 clarify this concept for us. Let us chant those slo:kas (verses) and try to listen attentively to Sri Krishna’s divine message.\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\napadām apahartāram dātāram sarva sampadām\nlokābhirāmam śrīrāmam bhūyo bhūyo namāmyaham\nChapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita enlightens us on karma yoga (the path of action). Karma yoga means transforming the work we do into a ‘good’ deed. A ‘good deed’ is one done in a way that does not add to our bondage. The activity must be done. However, the work being done should alleviate the burden, not add to it. Karma yoga is action done such that it does not add to, but rather reduces existing burden. It means, one has learned about the action properly and is exercising it. The purpose of human life can be attained only when one works this way. For this, one must attain jnana nishta (steady knowledge of realities). Jnana nishta results in one knowing himself. This is commonly referred to as atma sakshatkaram (self-realization). The term ‘atma sakshatkaram’ is generally difficult to understand. However, it is easier to comprehend when explained as ‘getting to know ourselves’. So let’s go with this. The means that enables us to achieve this is: to perform karma (action) by transforming every activity into a yoga (union).\n‘I won’t do it that way; I’ll simply do how I wish. What will happen then?’, asked Arjuna. Sri Krishna answers him thus in verse 3.6.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarmendriyāṇi saṁyamya\nya āste manasā smaran |\nindriyārthān vimūḍhātmā\nmithyācāraḥ sa ucyate || BG 3.6\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who restrains the organs of action but whose mind dwells on the objects of the senses, such a deluded person is called a hypocrite.\n-----------------------------------------------\n[Imagine] one is doing an activity. Initially, however, he is reluctant to do it and just sits idly… Like how a crane feigns meditation, standing in water. It is actually meditating with eyes closed, standing still on one leg, with oncoming waves splashing him… Yet it stays unperturbed. It appears as if it has amazing control. However, it has its own natural tendency. It has a mind inside and that mind is contemplating on the food nearby. It stays put this way until it gets its food. When an unseen fish surfaces and approaches nearby, it then quickly snatches the fish and flies away. All along it was thinking of fish, but kept its body in full control like a yogi (seer), and stood still. What should we call this? A new name has been coined for such behavior. It is called konga japam (crane’s meditation).\nEkadasi (the eleventh day of every fortnight), comes twice every month. Some get worried as Ekadasi approaches. They feel weak as soon as the day starts. Just the thought itself makes them weak even before the day arrives. Why does one feel weak? Not because he fasted, but because he was thinking of the fast on that specific day. Though resolved to abstain from cereals, he ate a lot of other varieties to compensate for it. He simply stayed away from rice-based meals. Someone shared this recently with us… ‘Since I resolved not to eat rice, I feel weak all day. However, I ended up eating much more than usual.” “I ate fruits and other snacks that were made. I did not take rice however.” If he had taken regular meals, he would have been content and carried on with his duties. Since he decided not to take rice on Ekadasi day… He substituted it with 2 or 3 or 4 times the quantity of other items. He ate more. Though he consumed more items and quantity than usual… the thought that he did not eat his regular meals on the day makes him feel weak. What made him sad or challenged? What made him unfulfilled? The thoughts, in his mind. Imagine if he told himself that he ate all his meals though he did not. He would have been fully content. If he would have mentally resolved his thoughts that way, he would have actually been content. He would have been fine, without weakness even if he did not feed his body. However, if he felt that he had not eaten anything though he had, or… that others had not fed him or what he ate was not enough… the thought of weakness continues to consume him and make him unhappy.\nThe manas (mind)… An activity done with a fully engaged mind is more critical than that done with just the body. Thinking that you have controlled the body but letting your mind have these thoughts will cause you further harm. Then, it is called something else. What happened here? Ignorance filled the mind and took over. Then, such a person is called mithya charudu (hypocrite). That is, his goal is something, but he is journeying in a different direction. He desires one thing but his activity leads him to another. He desires atma sakshatkaram (self-realization)… However, his mind longs for and enjoys only worldly materialistic objects… rather than contemplating on the soul and Lord whom he desires. The issue is not physical, but rather psychological, i.e. mental. Why did this question arise in the first place? Because he was arrogant in thinking he could achieve everything by himself. He thought he was restricting his senses. Or he thought ‘I am not doing any karma (action).’ Or he thought he had done karma tyagam (given up all activity). Or he thought he had stopped doing karma (action)… while the mind continued to do whatever it wished, enjoying everything. What are those people called? *mithyācāraḥ sa ucyate* (He is called a hypocrite).\nWhat activity was supposed to be done? The challenge is not only restricting the body. Restraining the mind is key! As mentioned earlier, if one thinks ‘I ate to my satisfaction. My stomach is full now’… then even without food, he will not feel weak or sad. Sri Krishna speaks about this in the next verse, 3.7.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyas tu indriyāṇi manasā\nniyamya ārabhathe arjuna! |\nkarmendriyaiḥ karmayogam\nasaktaḥ sa viśiṣyate || BG 3.7\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBut he who, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages the organs of action in karma yoga, without attachment, he excels.\n-----------------------------------------------\nOne must want to relinquish attachment. Let indriyas (the senses) work. The mind, however, should rest on God. This is what must be done. In our culture, elders bestowed a wonderful practice to us. We need food daily. Every morning we need something to eat. It is called ‘breakfast’ now. Today, we are asked to eat this breakfast after getting out of bed, or even before getting up! After bathing, or even before, calling the deed finished. However, in our culture, it is recommended that we first bathe and feel that the food is made for God. That it is not made for me to eat or for my needs, instead it is made for Him. One prays to God, feels the food is made for Him… and that he is there to serve Him… and this is happening with the strength and vigor given by Him.\nsvashesha bhuthena maya\nsviyahi sarva parichchadaihi\nvidhatum pritam atmanam\ndevaha prakramate svayam\nHe is purified with the thoughts of, ‘He, being my indweller, is enabling me to do this’. Another also does the same activity, i.e. he prepares breakfast. However, that breakfast is prepared simply to fill the stomach. Actually, one’s breakfast is not simply to fill the stomach. Instead, it is prepared as an offering to God. He offers it to God. He feels that God accepted his offering. Then he eats it, like how it is distributed to all devotees [at the temples]. Eating food is a natural phenomenon for the tongue. If you leave it to its natural behavior, it will continue to work without bothering you. While letting the tongue eat the food it needs, be sure it does not become a bondage for you. What does bondage mean? If the food one is consuming just as a breakfast does not have enough salt or spice or sweet… though eating it, he admonishes the chef that it does not taste good due to missing some ingredient or another. Yet, he does not stop eating it. He eats it and then screams at the cook. His mind is agonized and so is that of the poor chef. But, he does not stop eating that food. He invited a few additional mental challenges now which are self-inflicted. It means he added more to his bondage.\nHowever, if he had consumed that food with the thought of offering to God… when the food is served to him, he takes it in with a pure feeling… he doesn’t think he is eating it to fill his stomach. He eats it with the thoughts, ‘This is God’s prasada (sacred offering). I have God inside me.” He offers it to that indwelling God called anuyaga (inner offering), and consumes it for that purpose. You gave what your senses needed. Since done with the noble thought of God’s prasada, that can eliminate the heap of your past sins. God feels joy. He, from within, destroys accrued karmic reactions, suppressing rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance)… transforming the feelings of raga (attachment), and dvesha (aversion) and… makes your current activity favorable. It is inevitable for the body to engage in an activity. However, one must learn how to perform that activity. For instance, adults prepare food for kids at home or cater to their other activities. Or assume a person was hired to do these. He has to do the work anyway. While involved in that, if he complains, ‘Why am I assigned to this work? Why do I have to do this?’ Doing that activity is inevitable, instead of complaining… he feels satisfied if it is done with affection and joy. The other one is also content to receive the benefit of activity. Doing the activity becomes easy and comfortable. Otherwise, it feels like the burden of a 40 kg man asked to lift a 100 kg bag. Instead of working while complaining, he now completes it comfortably, even if it is a larger scope of work.\n‘O son! You should not simply control the senses while letting the mind wander. Even when the senses are acting up, let the mind focus on God’… *manasā niyamya ārabhathe karmendriyaiḥ karmayogam* (controlling the senses by the mind, engages the organs of action in karma yoga)… Let the activity happen. However, if a person’s mind focuses on what is needed, even while doing that activity, then that person is called asaktha (unattached). How is he able to do that? Because he is not attached to the activity. He does not feel arrogant, ‘I am doing this myself..’ He does not feel selfish, ‘This is mine’. He does not foster an attitude of, ‘Only I should enjoy this fruit, no one else can.’ Therefore, he became asaktha (detached), toward this. Only such a person… *vishishyate* (excels)… becomes easily eligible to receive real jnana nishta (assimilated and established knowledge of self). Not the one who imagines he controlled himself by just tying his body down but letting the mind wander freely. He only destroys himself and is not enlightened in any way. Therefore it is imperative to do karma yoga. While revealing this in verses 3.6 and 3.7, Sri Krishna elaborates on karma yoga to Arjuna. Let’s learn.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nNo person, while alive, should ignore his responsibilities. The responsible acts when done with a divine feeling are known as karmas (actions). This karma (action), if done surrendered and dedicated to God, is called dharma (righteous duty). Such an act works as a stepping stone to elevate oneself and thus transforms into yoga (union with the divine). Therefore, it’s the duty of everyone to transform every karma (action) into yoga (union with the divine). We may or may not like to carry out such acts. Sometimes they are favorable. Other times not so favorable. Occasionally some of them are difficult and arduous to execute, yet they must not be ignored. If anyone wants to act with the intent of giving up his duty, God does not accept this approach in 2 different ways.\nFirst: even if you feel that you stopped to act, prakriti (nature) somehow manifests a new wave, a new emotion, instigating your inner samskaras (impressions from past lives), to draw you towards it. He (Lord Krishna) said, “Therefore, you have not stopped acting, despite thinking otherwise.”\nSecond: the mind within has accumulated several samskaras (impressions from past lives) from many previous lives. Though we externally resolve to stop doing any activity, due to their influence, the mind internally repeatedly weeps and drags you towards its choices. Therefore, it is useless to cease your duty and is actually beneficial to simply carry it out. Also, it is better and necessary to train the senses to properly do the activities that they are accustomed to.\nStreaming water is known to have a flow. Enable a channel for the water to flow in a manner that adds benefit to you. Do not obstruct it in anyway. Thus, water flows easily and will benefit you as well. We experience this in the world. If you decide to block the stream from flowing, it will either stagnate or flood the upstream areas. Either way, it’s a negative outcome. Activities carried out with our senses and the bodies are akin to this. Streamline the perception you have of the acts that you do. Habituate it to treat them as a service to supreme God. An effort is required to pump the water stream upwards into a tank, whereas they flow downwards effortlessly. They just flow easily down on their own. So, karma yoga (path of action), is like making the water flow downwards. There is not much effort in it as they are naturally carried out anyway. But aspiring for tapas (austerity), yoga (union with the divine), yagna (ritual sacrifice), jnanam (knowledge), while ignoring one’s duty is akin to pumping water upward to a mountain top. It is harmful and it can ‘fall’ anytime. Imagine one wanting to push a big rock up a mountain - it must be pushed up gradually every moment while carefully observing its movement. If by chance one’s hand slips, the rock will roll down crushing him on the way. It then hurls further down the mountain causing more harm. The senses behave similarly. Therefore, it is imperative to learn how to execute activities that the senses are used to, as a service to God. Acting as per scriptural guidance is always beneficial.\n“One who is steadfast in such karma yoga (path of action) is in a better state than those with jnana nishtta (established knowledge of self).” Sri Krishna says so in verse 3.7. He further elaborates in verse 3.8.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nniyatham kuru karma thvam\nkarma jya:yo:hi akarmanaha |\nsari:ra ya:thra:pi cha the:\nna prasiddhye:th akarmanaha || BG 3.8\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou must perform your prescribed duty, for action is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of your body would not be possible without action.\n-----------------------------------------------\nakarmanaha (one who doesn't do karma) – ‘One who doesn’t do karma (action)’ means one who is in jnana yoga (path of knowledge) or one who gave up on his duty. Some might infer (incorrectly) that they are in jnana yoga (path of knowledge) and stop working. It means, there is a chance that those who think they have left (for jnana yoga) could fall down. Or maybe that he has not even begun. In the case where he did not begin, he may be forced to act in the future due to the pressure from the internal senses. Therefore, instead of being in such a position, karma jya:ya ha akarmanaha (one who comfortably acts on his duty is a better person). When we do a comparison between two, it implies that both have the right. i.e. jnana yogi (one on the path of knowledge) and karma yogi (one on the path of action), both are allowed to perform their duties. Only then, we can compare these two. We don’t compare one with another who does not have the right. Even for a jnana yogi (one on the path of knowledge), who has authority to stop doing karma (action), Lord said that performing karma (action) is paramount. Sri Krishna is thus showing us in verse 3.8, the superiority, significance, and necessity of performing one’s karma (action).\nWe act on 2 types of karma (actions) - niyatha karma (fixed actions) and aniyatha karma (unfixed actions). Acts done by compulsion are niyatha karmas (fixed actions). If someone is cursed, its results have to be endured. If someone is bestowed with boons, they have to be indulged. These are called niyatha karma (fixed actions), they cannot be altered in anyway. Kubera’s son, Nalakuvara, perhaps, once cursed Ravanasura. He cursed him, “If you ever lay your hand on a woman forcibly, then your head will split into many pieces. Beware!” This is the curse. Setting aside whether or not Nalakuvara is stronger than Ravanasura, it is a curse uttered by a divinely powerful being. Ravanasura was also great, correct? He tried to win over 3 worlds by then. He even tried to beat Yama once, though retreating for some reason. Despite being that great, when he kidnapped and restrained mother Sita in Lanka, he did not dare to touch her. Even Ravanasura had knowledge that when someone curses, its results are bound to come true. Therefore, he put her under a tree, and tortured her with arguments and emotions, yet never dared to touch her. He arranged approximately 700 demonesses to guard her in a shift system. He must have had around 200 demonesses per shift - morning, afternoon, and night. And perhaps had another 100 as a backup. Though they resorted to verbal and emotional pain, none of them physically abused Sita. It is incredible that Ravanasura never tried to test whether Nalakuvara’s curse would work or not. A great person’s utterances, when favorable, is called a boon and unfavorable is called a curse. The historical epic exemplifies how much Ravanasura respected such utterances. Similarly, the result of a qualified person’s statements is called niyatham (fixed). It will yield a niyatha (fixed) result. Hence, it must be experienced.\nThe results of other types of karmas (actions) are called results of aniyatha karmas (unfixed actions). So all the acts that we do in the world generally that result in sins and merits are called aniyathas (unfixed). Aniyathas (unfixed) can be altered or modified if we want to. How can they be altered? By performing a counter act. For example, while cooking, if someone adds an extra spoon of salt by accident, this is called aniyatha karma (unfixed action). We can imagine the plight of those who consume that food later. How to neutralize the taste? Add 2 spoons of sugar, or lots of water and drain the curry many times to dilute the effect of excess salt. This example illustrates that one can perform redemption to reduce or remove the unfavorable effect or improve the results. Such karmas (actions) or the results of the karmas (actions) are called aniyathas (unfixed). That is, they are not fixed as such. When in an unfavorable, unhealthy climate, we might contract a virus. A fever or other disease ensues. We then take medicine to curb this virus. This is aniyatha karma phala (result of unfixed action), the result of something alterable, from a physical body perspective. This applies to concepts in scriptures as well. Our acts also comprise both niyatha (fixed) and aniyatha karma (unfixed action).\nSri Krishna says, niyatham kuru karmathvam (you must perform your prescribed duty). Whatever karma (action) is niyatham (fixed), i.e. those must-do acts, you cannot drop or avoid them. kuru (do) those. (Sri Krishna says to Arjuna) Now you have the authority to rule. You have a responsibility to impart a lesson to those rulers who govern their kingdom poorly, causing hardships to their subjects. Therefore, the war that is upon you now is your niyatha karma (fixed action). You cannot cease such acts. (Arjuna says), ‘If I wage this war, I have to kill some and spare others. Will it not result in any karmic bondage?’ (Sri Krishna says) ‘Firstly, you are realizing it as your responsibility and doing it. Secondly, you are surrendering to Me and executing this act as a service to God. Therefore, it will not result in any bondage to you. Such karma (action) is considered better than the karma (action) of one who thinks they should ignore their duty and simply gain knowledge. karma jya:yo:hi akarmanaha (action is superior to inaction).’\nLet me offer you another reason. Will you attain moksha (ultimate liberation) and bliss, the moment you attain atma nishtta (firm knowledge of self)? Will anyone even try this if it ever works out like this? Everyone wants to survive a bit longer even after attaining that state. So, during the remainder of his life, he must survive. i.e. he must eat food, dress, move about. All of this is needed. This is called sarira yatra (journey of the body). If you stop all your acts, how will the body undergo its journey?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsari:ra ya:thra:pi cha the:\nna prasiddhye:th akarmanaha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEven the maintenance of your body would not be possible without action.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is difficult to experience the journey of the body, if one chooses to cease their duties. Then will that person be considered alive or dead? To be able to live and carry on this journey, one has to earn a living which requires him to work - which requires intelligence. So, any work done with intelligence that provides a means to earn, which in turn helps body to make its journey, is called karma (action). This will stop as well if you stop acting on your duty. Therefore, you cannot cease your duties at all. Karma (action) must be carried out and must be done as a ‘yoga’ (union with the divine). Sri Krishna thus explained to Arjuna in verse 8.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of gurus)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nPeople carrying out activities as prescribed by Ve:da:s (scriptures) or scriptures will attain some result out of that. They wish that certain activities yield results right away, with some yielding results in the long run. If anyone claims that obeisances to God results in being granted mo:ksham (liberation), … Mo:ksham (liberation) means leaving the current body and going away, as per common norm. So, mo:ksham (liberation) is when one leaves the body and goes to Vaikuntam or Parama Padam or Kaila:sam or another realm. For many, the meaning of mo:ksham (liberation) is to renounce the current life and depart. If it was said that mo:ksham (liberation) results immediately after doing namaska:ram (obeisance) to God… no one will dare to even enter God’s temple! No one will go. Why? Because everyone prefers to live long happily. They would rather that God fulfill their wishes while they live. Who knows what follows after? If something good follows, then that’s great! Setting that aside, while in this life they wish … ‘I have to have a safe life, enjoy life with relatives, with no dearth of food, wealth, houses, cattle and live a happy life.’\nVe:da:s (scriptures) prescribe a ya:ga (offering), an offering, known as Jyo:tishto:mam. jyo:tishto:me:na swarga ka:mo: yaje:ta: (Those who want to reach heaven must do Jyotishthoma). It means, those who want to reach swargam (heaven), heaven - must do Jyo:tishto:mam. Once a vedic pandit (scholar) conducted this Jyo:tishto:mam sacrifice. Imagine if a divine plane destined for heaven arrives and asks him to board it as soon as the ho:mam (fire ritual) is completed… He will not get on it! As he didn’t expect it so soon. He wanted to go to heaven eventually, not right now! What does he want now? He still has time left in his life. All that remaining time must pass happily. That is why even Ve:da:s (scriptures) say that you need not go to heaven right away when performing this offering. It claims that as long you live, you will have no diseases or ailments. a:yura:sa a:sthe: (May you live long). Since there is life ahead, he needs a spouse and kids, so it says, supraja:s tvama:sha a:sthe: (You will have good kids too.) ‘You will have good kids too.’ For now, he needs the means to raise them. Nurturing them requires a house and other resources.\nIn the case of Kuche:la (Krishna’s childhood friend), he had a large family with no house. His wife admonished him, ‘Why don’t you go seek your friend Krishna’s help?’, and sent him. Sri Krishna knew Kuche:la’s situation, He didn’t need to be told anything, nor was anything explained. Lord knows everything. That’s why He gave divyam dha:ma:sa a:sthe: (a divine abode). He therefore manifested a Dha:ma (abode), a beautiful house, and gave it to Kuche:la. Each among the bunch of his kids was given a nice separate suite to comfortably live in. There was also a large assembly hall for all to get together. Everyone had a private dining area as well as a common dining area to accommodate all. He arranged all of this for Kuche:la and his family to live comfortably. Like He said - Yo:ga kshe:mam vahami! (I carry what they lack and preserve what they have!) He somehow arranged everything personally. Even Kuche:la’s wife didn’t know all the details. When he returned, he couldn’t recognize her and asked, ‘Who are you?’ She then said that you arranged everything for our sake and showed him the whole house. She said, ‘A couple of gentlemen, with red and dark complexion, came and gave all this to us’. They were Sri Krishna and Balara:ma who came and handed this to her. When the family is large, it needs a large accommodation and adequate wealth for their needs. They should have ways to fulfill other wants, with house keepers for chores. All of these are needed. Everyone desires these. They do not want to simply disappear from this life and go to God after paying obeisances to Him. If that happens, it becomes a poisonous pond.\nNamma:lva:r is one of the a:lwa:rs (saints) and a divine soul. This great soul sang a few Tamil songs, called pa:surams (hymns). That composition is called Thiruvaimo:zhi, which comprises approximately 1000 songs glorifying God. In it, he says whoever reads it will gain maranama:kki vaigundham kodukkum pira:n (the Lord who gives Vaikuntam after death). He sang that such people, maranama:kki (after death), will be liberated from this body and… vaigundham kodukki (will be given Vaikuntam), God will offer Vaikuntam to them. Imagine the impact of the songs sung and those who have faith in them! After the songs were revealed, people sang them.\nLife in a typical family environment is not a bed of roses. Things are said from time to time and they fight among themselves. They make up eventually. However, new challenges surface later and again they make up - the cycle continues. Life moves on in that fashion. It carries on continuously like the effect of light and darkness or like a taste that is sweet and spicy. However, when that situation occurs the first time, if one argues with another, at that instant they get heavily enraged … they are ready to inflict any kind of harm on one another. Imagine the situation of a mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law. Mother-in-law wants to exhibit her authority while the daughter-in-law craves to show off her brilliance. At times, they get hurt based on what others said, what they imagined, what others do and what they see. If the daughter-in-law ever talks back, then the mother-in-law would be appalled. She would feel, albeit temporarily, ‘What is this? Have I lived this long to see this? I do not want to live anymore!’ If she holds her thought process for a bit and thinks, then she asks herself why she thought that way. They later adjust and live amicably again. There needs to be a time gap to survive such turmoil.\nThat is why our elders have shared a secret with us. That, if ever we are irritated with anyone and are burning up, then do not transfer the heat on to the other. Instead, grab a pen and paper and jot down everything, how and what you want to say to him. Just don’t send that letter. Fold it and stow it away in your desk. After a couple of days, open the table desk and read the letter again. You will be surprised about what you said in there. It reflects the state where one is temporarily enraged. It is at its peak! There should be an opportunity to bear that rage. It requires a venting of feelings elsewhere. Therefore, it is advised to write it down. Once written, one fulfills the need to express it. Later, the same feelings appear humorous. In that rage, we want to say something. Then go into a room, close the doors and do not speak to anyone. After a while, when your anger subsides, you will again feel normal.\nSimilar to the feeling of wanting to do something, due to that temporary anger… Divya Prabandham (Divine Composition) [Thiruva:i Mozhi] says, ‘reading this results in leaving the body and reaching Vaikuntam’… The families in those days [when in that state of quick temper] used to open the book immediately and read it end to end. Then they immediately left their bodies and attained Vaikuntam and mo:ksham (liberation). Unsure if they attained mo:ksham (liberation) or not, but first they would definitely leave this body here. What happens then? The system becomes chaotic! Getting upset with another is natural. It can happen between a wife and a husband or mother-in-law and daughter-in-law or among friends or between old and young or father and son or among siblings. Anyone can feel anger. It’s temporary and it needs a little time to subside. In those days, many used to read this Prabandham (composition) fervently and give up their body. No one knew where they ended up after that. The societal system then became topsy-turvy and chaotic. Then everyone thought that this a:lwa:r’s (saint's) prabandham (composition) was a poisonous medicine, not fit for society. So they dumped all the copies into nearby rivers. The entire prabandham (composition) was thus lost.\nThe lost prabandham (composition), however, also had many teachings that offered premier values. Life is not just made up of arguments, correct? There are also moments of happiness. Those need to be remembered. Some remembered those valuable pa:surams (hymns) and continued to recite them in the temples. Later on, one of the great a:cha:ryas (spiritual teachers), named Na:tha Muni, heard such pa:surams (hymns) in the divine Kumbhako:nam temple. He heard songs such as A:ra:vamude: adiyenudalam (Oh Nectar, my body). He found out how they can be obtained. Earlier, there was an a:cha:rya (spiritual teacher) called Madhura Kavi, who had received the grace of Namma:lva:r. That was approximately 4000 years ago. He had written 11 pa:surams (hymns) then, to please Namma:lva:r. If one recites these, then Namma:lva:r appears to share the prabandham (composition) again. Na:tha Muni traveled to the village from where Namma:lva:r originally hailed, and recited these 11 pa:surams (hymns) 12,000 times. Namma:lva:r then appeared and asked what he wanted? Na:tha Muni requested the knowledge of His prabandham (composition) in full. Namma:lva:r agreed. A screen was then placed with Na:tha Muni sitting on one side and the deity of Namma:lva:r on the other side. Namma:lva:r asked him to write down what was being shared, Na:tha Muni obliged. Na:tha muni asked why this amazing prabandham (composition) was lost? Namma:lva:r explained saying, “We are making slight modifications to the original text.” Earlier it said, maranama:kki vaigundham kodukkum (gives Vaikuntam after death). That is, it would give death followed by mo:ksham (liberation). Now we [Namma:lva:r] are modifying it as, maranama:na:l vaigundham kodukkum pira:n (the Lord who gives Vaikuntam if death occurs). Everyone faces death at a certain time. It varies from individual to individual. He modified it as - “The effect of reciting prabandham (composition) leads to mo:ksham (liberation) only after their scheduled time of death.” Since then, our elders said it became a prabandham (composition) that could be recited joyfully by everyone.\nSimilarly, any activity done as a service to God should please Him but should not yield mo:ksham (liberation) right away. If that happens, no one would participate. What should happen then? God should allow one to live his full alloted life-span on this earth. After that, they should please God, cleanse his sins, dissipate ka:rmic (related to karma) bondage… suppress his ra:ga (attachment) and dve:sha (aversion), wipe out punya (merit) and pa:pa (sin), and then provide him access to God’s abode. If this is what it does, it’s good. Until then, the journey of life is called sari:ra ya:tra (journey of the body). It must ensure that this sari:ra ya:tra (journey of the body) is done properly. Whatever is needed for that, should be fulfilled. Even to get to this state, it is much better to employ karma yo:ga (path of action) instead of jna:na nishtta (steadfastness in knowledge), or the path of jna:na yo:ga (path of knowledge). Because [karma yo:ga (path of action)] is something we are used to and is not inconvenient. Doing something that we are not used to, i.e if we do have to do jna:na yo:ga (path of knowledge)… then, as we are not used to it, we will be mentally strained focusing on it. If done incorrectly, then it causes unnecessary hardships. Instead of venturing into such things, it is better to follow the path that we are used to, which is devoid of danger … one that pleases God. Even more, it is easier to perform karma (action) than jna:na (knowledge) [yo:ga (path)]. It will also help us in our journey of life. Therefore, Sri Krishna says in verse 8…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsari:ra ya:thra:pi cha the:\nna prasiddhye:d akarmanaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt means, whoever ignores karma (action) and does not do it, instead prefers jna:na yo:ga (path of knowledge) … and feels, ‘I do not have to do my duty and just need to immerse myself in jna:na yo:ga (path of knowledge)’… for such a person it gets difficult even to undertake sari:ra ya:tra (journey of the body), the journey of life.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAnyone who does not need the support of his body ever, such a person can certainly follow the path of jna:na yo:ga (path of knowledge). He would not need to eat or sleep or drink. It is for the one who does not have the need to fulfill his bodily necessities.

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nAs long as we live, we should spend wealth that is earned ethically. The goal for every human is to recognize that such earnings are God-given, and to live a life exclusively as an offering to Him. Bhagavad Gita enlightens us on this. One should not just earn by any means. The earnings must be legal and obtained by rightful means.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBecause only when such earnings are spent on activities to benefit oneself, his family, the society he lives in, or to offer to God, then every act he does becomes a yajna (act of worship). Such acts are categorized into 5 types. They are named as pancha maha yajnas (the five great acts of worship). The journey of life must be undertaken only to perform these five great yajnas. [Some might ask] ‘How can I manage to do these so-called pancha maha yajnas (five great acts of worship)?’ [The answer would be] ‘Whatever you do, perform it as a yajna (act of worship)!’\nWhat are these pancha maha yajnas (five great acts of worship)? The first is Brahma yajna (worship of the divine reality). Second is Deva yajna (worship of nature/deities). Third is Pitru yajna (worship of ancestors). Fourth is Bhuta yajna (worship of all beings). Fifth is Nru yajna (worship of humans). These are the names of five yajnas (acts of worship). What do they entail?\nNru yajna (worship of humans) means providing for the needs of humans who we engage with. So simple! Anyone can do this, isn’t it? Recently when we were hit with Covid, many had to migrate from their current living areas. Several facilities were opened at many places to provide food for them. They served thousands of people then. This is an act of Nru yajna (act of worship for humans). It is an act of identifying the needy and providing food to serve them. What is this called? If one does it with a feeling that he is the reason for others’ welfare or that he is superior to the needy, it is called something else. However, if one recognizes that God has given this opportunity to serve others, and the act is done to please God who is also an indweller of the needy, then such an act becomes a Nru yajna (act of worship for humans). He is merely serving food to others. But if it is done with the right knowledge, then it is called a yajna (act of worship) and it becomes Nru yajna (act of worship for humans). It is when dealing with humans.\nHowever, are humans the only beings in our universe? ‘Serve all beings as service to God’. Isn’t it? One must serve all beings as service to Madhava (the compassionate Lord). All the beings that exist around us are called Bhutas (beings) – such as flies, ants, various micro-organisms. They support humans in their ‘life journey’ and help us in many ways. We get excited when we see a house-fly, ignoring its function, why and how. When we see them fly around in our home, we feel like we are home! When ants are roaming around, we feel our close friends are nearby. Mosquitoes do bite us occasionally. But they are also part of our life experience! Why did God create them? Maybe He did it, so that they become part of lizards’ food cycle. There are many beings around us. Those that move about and those that do not, such as trees and bushes. All of them are called Bhutas (beings). They all must survive well. Some might say, ‘How can we live if ants, flies, mosquitoes over-populate?’ No, no! It does not mean that. They must live within their scope.\nSomeone recently asked us, ‘Swamiji! You are calling this a service to God. It means we have to serve all. Then, why do we put birds in a cage?’ The devotee’s kids are holding their pet birds and animals in cages. However their mother does not like it. So, she wrote us a letter. “My kids are not heeding the advice of not restricting their pet animals. They say, ‘Even this should be treated as a service to God?’. What should I say?” That is true. If someone says, ‘Everything is a service to God and God is there even in a Lion’ and then bring a lion home, you will not survive even a day. Similarly, by saying ‘Service to God’ if you get a venomous snake to sleep with you, it will bite you and go on its way. Serving Bhutas (all beings) means letting them live in their preferred and conducive environments and serving them to facilitate their existence. Knowing that they are also an integral part of God’s creation and helping in their existence, then that indicates a true service to God. That becomes service to Madhava (the compassionate Lord)! As an example, let the captive snake survive in its basket or in its snake mound. Let a lion roam freely in the forest or allow it to survive in an enclosed habitat. If you can aid a lion in roaming in those spaces undisturbed, then you would have served God. Then you would have served many beings. You would not be serving God if you captured these beings, making them serve you or torturing them. In the case of pet dogs, it’s ideal if they stay in their places in your home. Instead, if you feed the dog from your plate while you eat or you eat from the same animal’s plate that you feed him from, this is not good! Because that is not even hygienic! It’s a health hazard. Due to the effect of Covid, everyone understands it well now. Whether it be animals, birds, micro-organisms, water or something else, everything in this world has a place and exists in an order. If you adhere to the rules of their specific existence and serve them as a service to God, then that is called Bhuta yajna (worship of all beings)! This can be done, right? It is not a bad thing either. These are Nru yajna (worship of humans), Bhuta yajna (worship of all beings).\nThere’s also Pitru yajna (worship of ancestors). Your mother and father are the reason for your existence in this world. Your mother has her own mother and father. As does your father. There is a long lineage of forefathers prior to you. It is only because of their grace that you exist today with this form and are able to live in this body. Think about the kind of favor they had bestowed upon you. Whether you get to see them or not, you must not do anything that displeases them. It means, serve your surviving parents and their elders well in a way that pleases them. In case they have expired, perform activities on their behalf that would bestow them noble realms. If you believe in them, perform rites for them as prescribed in scriptures. We call this as Pitru yajna (worship of ancestors). Ensure there is continued lineage to do these. This is called Pitru yajna (worship of ancestors).\nThen, we have Deva yajna (worship of nature/deities). When we say devatas or Deva (nature's powers or deities), it refers to the Nature around us. Nature that dons a supporting role for all the beings is known as Deva (nature's powers or deities). It has varied powers. It can give heat, cold, wind, wetness, moisture, etc. These are named Deva shaktis (powers of Nature). You must take care so that these powers of Nature exist properly. Recently many concrete jungles are being formed. Those areas lack dampness all around. Nature is devoid of moisture there. Existing wetlands are getting flattened. This is a type of harm done to devatas (nature's powers or deities). We observe during severe thunderstorms how villages get inundated. It is not that the villages received large inflows of water. In fact, the villages were built where a flow of water exists. Regardless of why those villages were built there, whether by a politician to further his fame, or middle-men misusing his name to occupy that area to build, that is secondary. By occupying an area which existed to support water, the constructed houses got submerged when there was a water inflow. Then, the citizens complain to the Governing authority. Do not harm nature’s water, land, wind, and light entities. Do not trouble the entities that can affect the climate. Our scientists also reiterate the same! They issued warnings that if the current climate change crisis continues, life for humans will become unbearable by 2050. You must show sufficient interest in safeguarding nature. This is called Deva yajna (worship of nature/deities).\nThe fifth is called Brahma yajna (worship of the divine reality). There is a divine energy inside all beings that sustains life. It is called Brahma or Para Brahma (divine energy or supreme divine reality)! It is immaterial whether you can physically see it or not. No one needs to wonder, whether atheist or otherwise, if there exists a hidden force behind life. All must believe in that force’s existence. Because without any effort on our part, we leave our body (at death). Many other things happen without our effort. He is able to do many other things. Therefore, there is something called daiva (God). It is Brahma tattva (the reality of God). There are scriptures which expound on His impact. There are Vedas (scriptures) and other scriptures that you should study well. Help others read them, encourage them and try to decipher what has been written. Do not simply reject them. Rather, try to grasp their embedded meaning. Firstly, study everything, then if you are able to condemn it, that's when one can 'discuss it'. Then that is called Brahma yajna (worship of the divine reality).\nSo the five yajnas (acts of worship) are Brahma yajna (worship of the divine reality), Deva yajna (worship of nature/deities), Pitru yajna (worship of ancestors), Bhuta yajna (worship of all beings) and Nru yajna (worship of humans). This life of ours is meant to perform these five yajnas (acts of worship). These have to be carried out as long as we live. Isn’t it? One must think about it. The name ‘Pancha maha yajnas (five great acts of worship)’ can be overwhelming and performing them might seem like an arduous task. However, like we discussed, it simply recommends one to treat others, surrounding Nature, and other beings well. We must treat this Nature well. Also live your life in accordance with and with a belief that an invisible God exists. How can anyone say no to this? If so, how can he be considered human? One must exist only to carry out this pancha maha yajnas (five great acts of worship). That life must be lived while earning in fair means.\nSattva (mind), here, means manasu (mind). Such food becomes proper food. When it is consumed, the mind becomes pure. Faults in the mind – raga and dvesha (attachment and anger) – get eliminated. This leads to an enhanced sattva (goodness/purity), suppressing rajas (greed/passion) and tamas (ignorance/darkness).\na:ha:ra suddhau satthva suddhi hi (purity of food leads to purity of mind)\nif mind becomes pure…\ndhruva smruti hi (it leads to focused thoughts)\nWork completes successfully with such focused thoughts –\nsarva grandhina:m vipra mokshaha smruti lambe (liberation from all knots of karma through focused memory)\nsarva grandhina:m vipra mokshaha (liberation from all knots of karma)\nIf one can act with focused thoughts such that there is…\nvyavasayatmika buddhireka (undisturbed focused mind on the set goal)\nHe will be liberated from karmic bondage. He will then naturally be wise with knowledge of atma (soul) and knowledge of Paramatma (God). Therefore,\nsharira yatrapi cha te na prasiddhyet akarmanaha (even your bodily journey would not be possible without action)\nIt is wrong to stop doing Karma Yoga (path of action), stop doing any activity, and shut everything off in life. Your journey of life and your duty of fulfilling pancha maha yajnas (five great acts of worship) will be affected as well. You will then become a culprit and a sinner. Don’t quit the rather simple, easy, healthy, and that which helps you attain a higher state. If you resort to those that are unnecessary, unfamiliar, and something new, then you are simply inviting trouble. Therefore, Karma Yoga (path of action) is always beneficial to follow. Sri Krishna thus explained to Arjuna in verse 8 and gradually moved further with His guidance.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nThe third chapter of Bhagavad Gita is known as Karma Yoga (path of action). Karma (action) implies the activities we do. Yoga (means) indicates a means. So, karma yoga implies transforming whatever activity we do as a means and then performing it. Naturally, a question arises…a means to what? We typically have a goal to rise above our current situation. How high should we aim for?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the entire world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nA small-time employee would like to rise up to his immediate manager’s level. That manager aspires to elevate to his manager’s level. That higher manager would aim for his higher secretary. That secretary would aim to reach the chief secretary level and further to minister, chief minister, prime minister or president. These are the positions that we are aware of. However, are there even higher positions than these? Yes, there are. In the world that can be experienced through the body, we have seen one highest position. An elevated position beyond it manifests when the soul relinquishes its bondage to karma (action) and sets free. Our elders have called that as moksham (liberation).\nMoksham (liberation) has been the ultimate goal from the outset. When a regular employee moves into an officer position, it means he is relieved from the previous role and reached a higher position. If he later moves into a further higher position due to a promotion and moves into a bigger position, then he is known to have attained moksham (liberation) from the previous role. Moksham (liberation) means liberation. When we need to, we should not ask for liberation from simpler things. An intelligent person seeks liberation from the biggest of the challenges. If we have to ask or beg for something, we might as well ask for something bigger instead of trivial things.\nOur guru used to share this story. Once a person decided to ask God for something. We alluded to this earlier. If God appears and says, ‘Hey devotee! I am pleased with your devotion, seek what you need and I‘ll grant it!’ It’s very unlikely, but in case the God says this. What would we ask for? Why should you ask for money or job or kids or authority or position? Why not ask for the best ask of all? What is such an ask? Our guru shared what the guy asked. What did he ask? Note, that he is not married yet! So, he asked, ‘O God! While eating savory crunchy snacks, I should cradle and feed my great grandson, in a golden crib, on the seventh floor, of my golden palace’.\nHow many wishes did he ask? Only one wish! God offered to fulfill only one so he asked only one. However, he being an intelligent one asked for a smart wish. What did he ask? That he wished to hold his great grandson. Note that he is not married yet. To have a great grandson, it takes some time. First, he must get married. Many married couples have issues bearing a child. So, he must have a child as well. Sometimes infants face several health issues at birth. The baby must grow up well and get married. Then that son of his should bear children. That child becomes his grandson. Our wish seeker gets his great grandson after his grandson grows up, gets married, and has children of his own. Then he must hold his great grandson. It means that he must survive until then. Just surviving isn’t enough. One needs money too! If he is alive until he holds his great grandson, it means he has sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters... They all should respect him until the time he holds his great grandson. To command that respect, he must be able to share wealth with them. He therefore sought that he should live on the seventh floor of a golden palace! Golden palace! And he should live there! It means, he should have given some wealth to his sons. If they don’t inherit at least some of his wealth, then they will not be happy. He should also give some to his daughters too, as they have equal rights. The stakes exist for grandsons and granddaughters too. Even they need to be given. He should have enough wealth to share with all of these relations. Apparently, he should survive to that point on the seventh floor, cradling the great grandson in his crib, while feeding him and eating savory crunchy snacks. That means he should have strong teeth until then. He should have good muscle strength too as he must be able to climb to the seventh floor. He won’t just be able to go up there! There were no elevators back then. No one can simply jump up there. So, he must be able to climb one flight of stairs at a time. To be able to climb, he should have good muscle strength along with dental strength and long life. How many wishes did he ask in one? His lineage must go on too …. All in one wish!\nSummary is that, when asking for a wish, note that the mind is not poor and neither is speech. Therefore, whatever you wish to ask, do it so that it yields the highest utility. Any work we do is a means. When any activity, i.e, karma (action), is performed, by transforming it into Yoga (means), what does one wish out of it? We neither want to or wish for any temporary benefits. Why? Any temporary benefit, however many ever they maybe, will dissipate eventually. It is not important to know how they are lost. The beneficiary may squander them or they may diminish themselves or they could be lost due to taxes or maybe other relatives take them by fighting him. They don’t stick with him till the end. They end up getting destroyed. Should we ask for those that get destroyed or that thrives? We must contemplate this. To seek for something that thrives, we must elevate ourselves into that position. This body is a blocker to get there. The body exists due to prior karmic bondage. It is the hold on us by vasanas (dormant memory records), and samskaras (impressions on the mind), made during previous lives’ activities! That is what one should be free from.\nUpanishads outline the benefits of getting out of such bondage. They say, one should attain a state similar to that of God. Attain a state similar to, sosnuthe saha bramhana vipaschitha (one should be able to reach a state equivalent to that of God - an amalgamation of abilities, characteristics, joy and experience). Therefore, wish only for that! Why wish for little things? Karma (action) can even become a means to yield such an epitome of benefit. The 3rd chapter of Bhagavad Gita, known as karma yoga (path of action), reveals this to us. Whatever karma (action) you do, any activities undertaken, can be transformed into a Yoga (means).\nWhen Sri Krishna was advising him that day, Arjuna’s duty was to decimate the evil doers. He could do it for that benefit alone. Yet, he was not seeing that benefit. He was assuming that he was waging war to destroy the enemy and enjoy the riches of the kingdom. Therefore, in earlier chapters he said:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyad rajya sukha lo:bhe:na\nhanthum svajanam udyatha:ha!\nSLOKA MEANING -\n(He says) \"due to the desire for the pleasures of the kingdom, I am ready to kill my own relatives!\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe says, rajya sukha lobhena (desire for the pleasures of the kingdom). It means, he thinks that he would have to fight for the kingdom, for its benefits, and to nurture the deep desire to get more and more out of them. However, any activity done by any human, that is suitable for his phase in life, age, situation, ability of body, as a Yoga (means), will yield a result which breaks the karmic bondage and drives him towards the ultimate goal of mukti (liberation). This is the message that Sri Krishna intended to share. That, Arjuna would attain moksham (liberation) even by waging the war. That, a farmer will attain moksham (liberation) by tilling the land. That, a housewife will attain moksham (liberation) by cooking for her family. That, a student will attain moksham (liberation) by engaging in learning. The student’s journey would entail tests, certificates, passing through grades - however, these are temporary achievements. If the goal is to achieve just those then the results will be limited only to them. In any activity, if you do not focus on such temporary achievements, it will lead you all the way to Bhagavan (Lord). This is true for anyone and for any activity. Imagine a tanner. A part of his profession assumes that he mends sandals and shoes. He will attain moksham (liberation) even by engaging in this activity!\nA different opinion has been offered here. A soul from an animal will incrementally take rebirth as a human, first as a down-trodden, then as a shudra (laborer class), followed by a vaishya (merchant class), then a kshatriya (warrior class) and eventually a brahmin (priestly class), and only when the brahmin (priestly class) becomes a sanyasi (ascetic), that he gets moksham (liberation)! It isn’t so! Our elders did not subscribe to this incremental soul journey! Anyone, in any state they are in, if they learn their prescribed duties and consistently execute them well, then they will attain moksham (liberation) from that state they are in! This is called karma yoga (path of action).\nArjuna wondered why he has to do karma yoga (path of action). Earlier, we alluded that there are 2 types of karmas (actions). One is niyatha karma (obligatory actions) and the other is aniyatha karma (optional actions). Aniyatha karmas (optional actions) are activities done for temporary needs and the resulting outcomes and benefits. Niyatha karmas (obligatory actions) cannot be avoided however. For example, one needs to eat, otherwise he cannot survive. One needs to drink water for survival. In addition, we also have to breathe to live. These are called niyatha karmas (obligatory actions). There is no choice here and they must be carried out. Imagine one gets a boon or a curse. He must endure the results of that boon or curse. This we knew already. These are niyatha karmas (obligatory actions). Some are aniyatha karmas (optional actions). Depending on the need, one needs to do these occasionally and experience their results.\nIn sloka 8, Arjuna asks:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\n…niyatham kuru karmathvam…\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"You should perform your prescribed duty.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhy should I do all these? I’ll not do any karma (action) at all! He said, he will stop doing any activity. ‘Well, you cannot stop the activity.’ If it cannot be stopped, then I’ll resort to jnana yoga (path of knowledge), which is different from karma yoga (path of action). I’ll be engrossed in jnana (knowledge). I’ll focus my intellect on it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\n…karma jya:yo:hi akarmanaha…\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"Action is superior to inaction.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nInstead of ignoring karma (action) and focusing on jnana (knowledge), karma jya:yam (action is superior). Doing karma (action) is superior! This is what Sri Krishna explained. For the question, ‘why this needs to be done’, He said:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\n…sari:ra yathra:pi chathe:\nna prasidhye:th akarmanaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"Even the journey of your body would not be accomplished without action.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe journey of the body must continue. That is, one has to survive in this life. Isn’t it? Today if you say, ‘I have been doing karma yoga (path of action), by transforming karma (action) into Yoga (means)’, then you would not get moksham (liberation) instantly. You are not leaving from here immediately, and there is no need to be afraid of that. When you approach God with devotion and pay obeisances, you are not getting moksham (liberation) instantly. We can therefore continue to do what we need to do. Since we need to survive in a body until the end result is attained, we must let the journey of the body continue. Time spent in such a fashion is called sharira yatra (journey of the body). Until then, we need to survive by earning and feeding ourselves. To earn, we must work. To get a job, we must learn. To learn we must study. These are all intermediary steps. These are part of sharira yatra (journey of the body) and these have to be done as well. Even if you cease all activity and sit idle, you are still performing karma (action). That does not mean that you ignored karma (action) or relinquished it fully! In chapter 3, Sri Krishna thus explained to Arjuna how to do karma yoga (path of action) and encouraged him towards waging war. Let us move ahead by learning more to have better clarity.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of gurus).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSome activities yield results quickly, while others take time. The duration of time depends on the type of activity and the desired result. When a seed is sown in earth, it won’t immediately produce flowers followed by fruits. Wanting to pluck those fruits immediately after sowing the seed is impractical. Also, one must carefully protect it from any harm, until it is time for the tree to yield results.\n[Some might say] ‘Why should we toil now for something that gives fruit 4 or 5 years later?’ If you don’t take care of it now, then it will not bear fruit later. ‘There is no benefit now for the hard work being put in. Isn’t it?’ Yet, you still need to work hard! The tree must be carefully fenced, watered, protected from every possible harm and allowed to grow. If a protective environment is set up, then it will yield the flowers or fruit it is supposed to at the right time.\nThere are certain plants such as bramha kamalam… When the seed is sown, it won’t sprout for several years. Even more… there are certain lotus plants, another type, not bramha kamalam… when sown, it takes approximately 13 years for it to yield flowers! Even after 13 years, it only flowers between 3am and 5am. Within that time, the flowers bloom and even wither by 5 am! It flourishes only in that duration! If we desire to witness it, we must take care of that plant carefully and nurture it all the prior years! We cannot look down on it because it is not giving results, nor ignore it. It should be guarded against any chance of animal exposure. Only then, that result can be witnessed.\nIf you would like a baby to be able to write fluently when he is born… As soon as he is born, if you hand a slate and chalk and ask him, ‘Hey! Write now!’ What will he write? He cannot write anything. Initially, he must be taught alphabets such as A, Aa, E, Ee, either in sand, on ground or on a slate or book. He must be taught to write there. It must be ensured that his hand can work to write and practice it. After this is accomplished, sometime later in grade school when he moves to either 7th or 9th or even higher grades… he will be able to write anything comfortably, even with his eyes closed. To gain this capability, he must strive hard during the early years. Isn’t it?\nThe body is given as a tool to practice something. To be able to undertake our designated practice, the soul is provided with this amazing tool. We must use this tool carefully. What will the result be then? It will help eradicate the bondage from karma and attain moksham (liberation). We alluded to moksham (liberation) earlier, as… ‘soul attaining the pinnacle by overcoming obstacles.’ This everyone desires. That is, to attain the last stage of joy! This we all desire. To reach there, we use this [body] as a tool. As a tool, it must be utilized carefully. As soon as we gain conscience, we should not demand, ‘when will we get it [moksham (liberation)]?’\nFor a baby you cannot feed crunchy snacks or spicy food as soon as he starts on solid foods. He will get sick otherwise. He must be allowed to incrementally progress to other items, then this tool he used called ‘food consumption’.... will help him build a strong body eventually. Similarly, as long as the body exists it should be used as a tool to do its duty properly with dedication. If it is used properly, then every activity will turn into an amazing tool to remove the obstacle of karma bondage. For how long? That is impossible to predict. Because our activity needs to be good.\nAfter a seed is sown, if we desire the plant to grow well… then it must receive sufficient water, with clean air and adequate sunlight and be sown in a fertile environment. If these help, then the seed will have a chance to take the shape of a plant and later as a tree. Similarly, in the case of a body one of the first activities it needs to do is select to consume only sattvic (pure) food. Also, to set aside rajasic (passionate), and tamasic (ignorant) activities. When we lean towards sattvic (pure) activities, the characteristics such as raga (attachment), and dvesha (aversion), that arise from rajasic (passionate) and tamasic (ignorant) natures, will subside. Once they subside and as we do sattvic (pure) activities our wisdom grows.\nsathva:th sanja:yathe: jna:nam (from goodness, knowledge arises)\nRight knowledge leads to right thoughts and they lead to right acts. Right acts are those that do not burden us further.\nthath karma yanna bandha:ya: (that action which does not bind)\nWe must do an activity that erases our bondage. If new bondages result due to current acts… If a current activity ends up requiring to lift 10 additional kgs, then that is not [good] work. Sage Parasara told us,\nyanna bandha:ya: … thath karma! (that which does not bind… that is action!)\nTherefore, the acts we do, must result in enhancing sattva (goodness)! Until then, our life journey must progress smoothly.\nIn BG 3.8, Sri Krishna explains why one must do karma yoga (path of action)…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsari:ra ya:thra:pi chathe:\nna prasidhye:th akarmanaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEven the journey of your body would not be possible without action.\n-----------------------------------------------\nJust like how our acts done by this present body should not yield any karmic bondage… there is onus on us to not add to the burden either from past lives’ bondage or being accrued for the future. This body is the tool to protect from these as well. It therefore must be properly used, until the end of its life span. As we use it, we cannot specifically assess the timeframe from which the accumulated karmas will be erased. We do not know how long [the body] needs to be used. However, we must use it in the present human life with its available limited resources.\nThe karma burned by a body in this life is called prarabdha (karma being experienced now). We are experiencing it now. However, this only amounts to a tiny amount of the whole, which is allocated to the present body. We still do not know how much more karma there is. That remaining karma is called sanchita (accumulated karma). This is manifold. Imagine a snowy glacier, only its small peak is visible in the sea but is actually quite large under the water surface. That peak is referred to as ‘tip of the iceberg’. Similarly, the amount of karma experienced through this body is like only the smallest tip of an iceberg. This body is attained with the allocation of only a tiny amount of karma. The body comes with all the responsibilities. If we use this body properly now, then it implies we are disposing of the top part of karma allocated. However, there is a lot more karma left in your account. Even if you exhaust this body in the process of disposing of the allocated portion of karma, … there is no doubt that you need another body to dispose of another small portion. When that is done, you need one more body and so on. There is plenty of stock left in its account! All of that remaining karma is called sanchita (accumulated karma). We do not know how much is left! We even do not know how many lives we need to burn it all!\nOne of Bhagavad Ramanujacharya’s disciples is the great Kuresa. He mentioned this in a sthothra (celebratory praise).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyad bramha kalpa niyuta:nyanubhave:th pyanasyam\nthath kilbisham srujathe: jantu riha kshana:rthe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe sin that a living being creates in half a minute here is such that it cannot be exhausted even by experiencing it for millions of Brahma Kalpas.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe explains about the amount of karma we accrue even in half a minute is enough for a number of lives. You might remember we spoke about chathuryuga (four yugas) earlier. According to our timeline, a chathuryuga (four yugas) comprises 43,20,000 human years! A day in Brahma’s life equates to 2,000 such chathuryugas (four yugas). Imagine a year in His timeline. Assume his life span is approx 1000 of His years, a Kalpa in His timeline. Kuresa says that many such Brahma Kalpas are still not enough time to burn the karma accumulated in half a minute! Why did He speak of this? To give us an idea of the amount of karma we have accumulated from past lives. We do not know the accumulated quantity nor the place where it’s stored.\nGenerally speaking, if anything is in excess supply, it would appear somewhere. However, lately, there is a new technology available in the field of computers. If you have several terabytes or petabytes of content, you do not need to store it on your computer. Instead, you can safely store it in ‘the cloud’. No one knows how much it will allow, however, it is saved there reliably. It is called iCloud. Our accrued karmas, designated as sanchitas (accumulated karmas), are stored somewhere safely on its iCloud! In Lord Yama’s Naraka Lokam (netherworld), Chitragupta oversees this department, with countless assistants. Overall, it is said that everyone’s karma is properly maintained in their account over there. That karma is known as sanchita (accumulated karma).\nApart from that, karma done in this life now in the present body will act like seeds sown for the future! We are preparing now so there is enough for the next lives! They are ready. Such karma is called agami karma (future karma). We do not know how long that karma will last. Therefore, there are sanchita karmas (accumulated karmas) on one side and agami (future karma) on the other side. In the middle which we are being endured now are prarabdha (karma being experienced now), like a tiny drop in an ocean.\nThe fascinating thing is, if you can transform the karma done in this life as a yoga (spiritual discipline). If this karma, that is classified as niyatha (prescribed) karma can be transformed into yoga (spiritual discipline)... then it will not only erase your sanchita karma (accumulated karma), but your agami (future karma) as well! It will also arrange in such a way that the current prarabdha (karma being experienced now) do not cause any bondage. Upanishad has established this!\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyada: ishi:kato:lam agnou pro:tam pradu:yata:\ne:vam ha:sya sarve: papma:na pradu:yante:!\nSLOKA MEANING -\nJust as a tuft of cotton thrown into fire is completely burnt, so too are all his sins burnt.\n-----------------------------------------------\nCotton balls are very soft to touch. If dropped into a blazing fire, they are annihilated with no trace left to be found. Similarly, if the acts done by this body are transformed into yoga (spiritual discipline) and executed properly… it will annihilate all three sanchita (accumulated), agami (future) and prarabdha karma (karma being experienced now), that we endure presently, without any remainder! In Thiruppavai, Goda Devi sings,\n…thi:yanil thu:su a:gum… (like cotton in fire)\nTherefore, we must do karma yoga (path of action) properly as it yields two benefits! One, it wipes out sanchita (accumulated) and agami karma (future karma). Second, the journey of current life goes smoothly. This body is something we are used to. All the while it exists, the journey must continue. If restricted, it will ensure you suffer. Therefore, to make life’s journey smooth, as water slides on a downward slope… let the body continue on its acts that it’s used to, but do them as yoga (spiritual discipline). With that, the life journey continues smoothly.\n…sari:ra ya:thra:...prasidhye:th … (the journey of the body... will be accomplished)\nSri Krishna thus moved further by expounding on the benefits of executing karma yoga (path of action) in chapter 3, verse 8. Let us also move along.\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 3,
    "episode": 23,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIn Bhagavad Gita, chapter 3, verse 9, Bhagavan (God) prescribed the right process for performing karma (action).\nmuktha sangaha sama:chara: (perform actions without attachment).\nmuktha sangaha (without attachment)...\nsama:chara: (perform actions).\nIt’s not recommended to abandon karma (action). However, leave the sangam (attachment) associated with it. Meaning - don’t think that you are the doer, or the cause, or the beneficiary of your work. If you can perform karma (action) without such attachment with the work, it will not bind you.\nthasma:th asakthaha sathatham (Therefore, always without attachment)\nmuktha sanga sama:chara: (perform actions without attachment).\nasakthaha (without attachment)\nwith no saktha (attachment).\nThen, how do you recommend we do it? What do you want us to do? The work we do yields some kind of result. It will bind us with it. “You are asking me to work.” “I am desiring no ties.” “However, you are asking me to do work that ties me up.” “What is this?” He asked. Karma (action) is not always something that ties you up. If you do not know the way to do it, it binds you. If you do know how to do it, it does not bind you.\nWhat does it mean ‘to know’? There is an electric wire that’s cut, causing power interruptions. A bulb goes off. We need the bulb to glow. That requires joining the disconnected wires. If you try to put them together, you may even lose your life. However, you can’t avoid doing that work. You must do it. You need to protect your hands with gloves and then work on it. That will keep you away from any danger. We know this. We must work but we must know how to work.\nCan you expect results as soon as you do the work the way you should? You may not achieve. Then why should you do the work? Because you need to carry on with the journey of life.\nsari:ra ya:tra na prasidhye:th (the journey of life cannot be accomplished).\nIf you stop working, you can’t lead your life. You need food to live. The body won’t be idle. Limbs move. The nose breathes. Ears listen. You have a tool, ‘body’, to work. It’s a great tool. If you say you will stop using it, that’s dangerous. So, you must make it work but the result is not immediate. You must allow the time it takes. We don’t know how long that will be.\n“Then, how does one continue to work that long, as there are intermediate results - both pleasing and unpleasing?” Krishna gave the answer for this in chapter 2.\ntha:n thithikshasva bha:ratha (bear with them, Arjuna).\na:gamapa:yina: nithya:ha tha:n thithikshasva (they come and go, they are not eternal, bear with them).\nUntil you get the result, have patience with the experiences that this journey of life gives you. If you desire a well-toned result, then won’t you expect your body to get sore during practice? Bear with that pain. If you have the lakshya suddhi (clarity of goal), perfect clarity and desire to attain the goal, you will need to bear with the intermediate pleasant and unpleasant experiences.\nthithikshasva (bear with them).\nYou buy rice, lentils, mustard seeds, jeera (cumin), etc., to cook a meal. You will need to then cook them in oil, ghee (clarified butter), or water, etc. You use fenugreek seeds, mustard, jeera (cumin), etc., in the oil. Boil the lentils. Mix with rice. When you eat, you may find something unwanted in it such as a grain of sand. There are certain factories that actually make this kind of material that suits different needs. Including the kind that gets mixed with rice grains, or lentils, or mustard, or jeera (cumin). They are added. If you end up biting one, it could hurt your teeth. Then claiming – “For this reason I will no longer eat rice!” Will any wise person react this way? In such situations, one will follow the recommended ways to separate them out. He can practice a way to follow the process and properly cook next time. He will then eat it. In case there is something that he needs to put aside, he will. Not eating is not the healthy thing to do. He knows it. Therefore, one must never abandon karma (action). You must continue to perform karma (action). At times, it can be a pleasing thing to do, or unpleasant. To keep going is what a human being must learn to do. It is the responsibility of everyone to do it. Upanishad states this.\nkurvanne:va iha karma:ni (one must continue to perform actions here).\nkurvan e:va (one must continue to do).\nIt is impossible to stop doing karma (action). You may say “Why do all this, it’s all a headache. I wish life would end.” You are not allowed to end life.\njiji:vishe:th (desire to live).\nYou must desire to live. Make efforts to live. Perform karma (action) properly.\njiji:vishe:th (desire to live).\nVeda (sacred texts) didn’t say ji:ve:th (live).\njiji:vishe:th (desire to live).\nMeaning to use the tool [body] properly for however long it’s made for. This is the summary. If you don’t use it, it will get destroyed. Rushis (sages) say… A day has 24 hours. An hour has 60 minutes. A minute has 60 seconds. What is a second made of? People can also divide this. God has given you all this time for free. He didn’t ask you for money. He asked you to use it carefully. You lose a second, it’s never back. You cannot get it back and you won’t get it replaced with any new second. If he has given you time to travel from one end to another, you must move ahead. If you say, “Oh no! I made a mistake. I will go back and correct...” It’s impossible to go back in time. You must move forward. God gave it all for free. Use it wisely without wasting even a second of it. How long? However long is allocated. You don’t need to know how long. So, continue to do your work.\njiji:vishe:th sathagum sama:ha (desire to live for a hundred years).\nsathagum sama:ha (for a hundred years).\nHundred years does not mean the numerical 99+1. Whatever is destined to be your time here, you must continue to work. You must desire to live and you must keep working. This is an upade:sa (teaching) from the Upanishads.\nNow what’s to be understood is how to do your work. You must transform it into yogam (a tool/union). Don’t do your karma (action) as karma (action). Convert the karma (action) into a yogam (a tool/union). What is meant by yogam (a tool/union)? Yogam (a tool/union) refers to realizing who the underlying provider is and working for Him. Let’s say someone established an office and employed ten people. He gave certain responsibilities to each. What is their work now? Can they scroll through WhatsApp, read the newspaper, or watch TV while at work? In that case, they are either let go or punished. As long as they are at work, they are required to work for the purpose that the owner has employed them. We all understand this. We don’t need sa:sthra (authentic scriptures) to grasp this. We don’t need to go further to ve:da:ntha (the essence of Vedas) to understand this. This is a general scenario.\nNow, who has employed you for a job called the body? Someone provided it for you. Use it as per the regulation of the provider. Who is the provider? God. The same God in the form of Sri Krishna gave us the upade:sa (divine message) of Bhagavad Gita. Use it [body] as per His order. Very Simple. You may say, “Why should I listen to what Sri Krishna says?” In that case, not because Sri Krishna said it… Veda (sacred texts) says that there is God and that He is Narayana. His order is in the form of smriti (recollected texts), ithiha:sa (historical narratives), pura:na (ancient tales), a:gama (traditional texts) and an illimitable volume of literature. All this is…\nyasya nisvasitham (whose breath).\nAll of it is available to us as His command. Follow it. Learn what it says and follow. Because we can’t learn the entire volume of content, God as Sri Krishna encapsulated it for us as a 700 verse scripture. Learn and understand. Practice the essence of it. He gave it for the purpose of making you implement/practice. Because it’s given by Him, you should practice it in the way He is satisfied. Isn’t this simple to understand? There is someone who gave it [body] to you. It is a tool. You are an employee in it. Use it for His happiness. If He is happy, He may give you better, happier and easier roles to play. We don’t know what roles He might give. However, better roles. If the owner is happy, he wishes for a comfortable and happier space for his people. Accordingly, he will arrange. It’s good if we can realize this. Any work done that pleases Him is called yajna (sacrifice/offering). That is why, God says in verse 3.9…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyajna:rdha:th karmano::nyathra\nlo:ko:: yam karma bandhanaha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nExcept for actions performed as a sacrifice, this world is bound by actions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nyajna:rdha:th karmanaha anyathra (whatever you are doing for the purpose of yajna, that will not bind you).\nAny work you do without the sense of yajna (sacrifice/offering) will definitely bind the soul with it. Once he is tied to it, we don’t know where he will be taken to. So, the essence of the message is to do everything as a yajna (sacrifice/offering). That is the purpose of the body given to us. Arjuna! The war that you are set to wage now is also a yajna (sacrifice/offering). The yajamani (patron) of this yajna (sacrifice/offering) is Dharmaraja. Those performing ho:ma (fire ritual) are called ho:thas (priests chanting invocations). The ho:thas (priests chanting invocations) are the four other Pandava brothers. This is a huge yajna (sacrifice/offering). Do this yajna (sacrifice/offering) properly, then it will not bind you. During this time, you may experience happiness or grief. Some may ‘leave’. It may be anything. You may experience loss. They may at times.\nyajna:rdha:th karmanaha anyathra (if you do karma as yajna, that karma won’t bind you).\nTherefore…\nthadarttham karma kaunthe:ya! (Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform actions for that purpose).\nthadarttham (for that purpose of yajna).\nDo it. However, while doing it…\nmuktha sangas sama:chara (perform actions without attachment).\nPut aside the feeling that you are the one doing it. Then, do it. Do it because it is the right thing for you to do. “Today, I fought this way and put away many people this way.” Don’t say that all of this happened because of you. “I am the beneficiary of all this with experiences of the kingdom.” Put this feeling also away. If you do it this way, then it becomes yajna (sacrifice/offering). It then pleases God. This is what you should do. Sri Krishna is taking Arjuna forward in chapter 3, teaching the way to perform one’s karma (action).\nVande: guruparampara:m\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIn Chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna bestows upon us a good recommendation: “Perform every work as a yajna (sacrifice).” Transform every work you do as a tool and perform it in a way, named as yajna (sacrifice).\nWhat happens to it then? It becomes a good tool to liberate you. It becomes an upayam (means). It becomes a mokshopayam (means to liberation), an upayam (means) for the ultimate state of liberation and joy. Upayam (means) is a good word. It means that which takes you closer to what you are desiring. Upa (close), aya (takes). Upayam (means) is that which takes you closer to what you desire. It is also called sadhanam (tool). That which takes you away [from what you desire] is called apa + ayanam (takes away). Apa + ayam (away), apayamu (hindrance). Upayam (means) is that which takes one closer; apayam (hindrance) is that which takes one away. Every karma (action) you do must become upayam (means). Upayam (means) is also called yogam (union). Yuk (unites) also means that which unites you with the goal that you desire. It is called yogam (union). What are you desiring? Attainment of ultimate joy. Good for you. Karma (action) is an upayam (means) or sadhanam (tool) for that ultimate joy. Whatever activities are ordained to you as responsibilities from the time of birth are called karmas (actions/duties). When we transform karma (action) as upayam (means), sadhanam (tool) or yogam (union) and perform it, it is called Yajnam (sacrifice).\nBecause we earlier heard or watched yajna (sacrifice) at various times in many ways, accordingly we think of a kunda (fire altar). It is constructed in various shapes. They are circular, triangular or hexagonal, or in the shape of a lotus. Some have five sides, or eight. Kundas (fire altars) can come in various shapes. Some are constructed in the form of Garuda (mythical bird) for some types of events. Kunda (fire altar) is a space constructed in a specific shape. There is agnihotra (fire ritual), fire in it. There is a priest called hota (priest). He recites something called mantras (sacred chants). He offers oblations to agnihotra (fire ritual) such as ghee (clarified butter), sticks and other elements. While offering, he chants so as to reach devatas (deities) like Indra, Varuna, Yama, Agni, Vayu, etc. He chants the desired recipient names and offers the oblations. It is called svahakara (offering chant). Such havirdana (offering of oblations), takes the oblations through agnihotra (fire ritual) to the respective devata (deity). This is what is said. All we can see is agnihotra (fire ritual). Because shastra (scripture) says that it reaches them that way, we listen and understand. The priest holds a certain set of ladles named suk and sruva with which he makes offerings. This is what we see on an external physical plane when we think of Yajna (sacrifice).\nHowever, that is not the only Yajna (sacrifice) there is. It is one type of yajnam (sacrifice). It is one way of performing yajna (sacrifice). In life, transform every single task or work done every second into yajna (sacrifice) and perform it. Whoever you are, if you do it that way, it will ensure that… prarabdha (destiny from past actions), the subset of karma (action) given in this current body, Sanchita (accumulated karma), backlog stock of karma (action), and agami (future karma), subset of karma (action) lined up for future will not be attached to you. It will alleviate you from all the bandhas (bonds). Therefore, do your duty that way. He says so in verse 9.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyajna:rdha:th karmano::nyathra lo:ko:: yam karma bandhanaha |\nthadarttham karma kaunthe:ya! muktha sangaha sama:chara ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nExcept for actions performed as yajna (sacrifice), this world is bound by karma (action). Therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform action for the sake of yajna (sacrifice), free from attachment.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYajnardhath karmano (perform karma to make it a yajna). It will then not tie you up and it will also relieve you from existing bondage. Why delay? Do it that way. “Is waging a war also a yajna (sacrifice)?” Yes, it is. What Arjuna is doing now is a Yajna (sacrifice). The yajamani (patron) is Dharmaraja. Bhima and others are the hotas (priests), offering oblations. The temporary outcome is royal pleasures and alleviation of suffering by pulling down a wicked administration. However, the eternal benefit for all of them is moksha (liberation). It’s not something that’s attained now. It’s for after this body. Until then, they must continue to do what they are prescribed. Sri Krishna is giving this divine instruction to Arjuna. For this, he is detailing a wonderful way of leading life.\nMimamsakas (followers of Purva Mimamsa) are those who accept Purva Bhaga (introductory text) of Vedas (sacred scriptures). They accept Yajna (sacrifice) and limit it to that, but do not accept the existence of souls called devatas (deities). They believe in mantras (sacred chants) as devatas (deities). They say that devatas (deities) exist but in the form of mantras (sacred chants). So, they do not advocate a form for devatas (deities). Our people show a form to the burning agnihotra (fire ritual), fire. Varuna is shown in the form of jala (water). It’s said that Yama also has a form. Rishis (sages) say that devatas (deities) have a form but Purva Mimamsakas (followers of Purva Mimamsa) don’t accept it. They don’t accept offering oblations specially to devatas (deities). They don’t believe in pleasing the devatas (deities), and thus they offer some benefits.\nDevatanam na vidyate vigrahe vigrahaha haviradanam yugapat karma sannidhihi pritihi phala pradanam cha devatanam na vidyate (deities do not have a form, nor do they accept oblations, nor do they give results). They decided this way. However, Vedantins (followers of Vedanta) did not accept it. Devatas (deities) have a vigraha (form). When an eligible person does an activity of offering havis (oblations) to devatas (deities), it reaches them. We don’t see anyone physically arriving there, receiving what’s offered. We don’t have that ability to see. It’s also not a suitable time to see them. Earlier, when events were organized, people would attend in thousands and lakhs. If the government imposes a lockdown, what it means is that it isn’t the suitable time. It could be the time-period or the time of the day that may not be suitable.\nBack then, Dasharatha performed putrakameshti yaga (ritual for progeny). Scriptures like Ramayanam (epic) say that all the devatas (deities) arrived there to receive the offered havis (oblations). Itihasa (history/epic) stands as a means of knowledge here. They arrived, they discussed certain kinds of topics. God also arrived there and offered abhayam (fearlessness/protection). Sage Valmiki carefully recorded these and offered us the history. Now, how can we say that devatas (deities) do not have bodies? “They are all tales. We won’t believe in them.” Do you believe in it if you can see them? “We will believe in it only if we see them.” These days, it’s not right to say that. Because, aren’t you operating a cell phone to see someone somewhere in the US? You are not saying that you won’t believe in it as you don’t see the relation between the two. You are sitting here and making a connection to someone there. Hence, it’s not right to say that you will believe only if you see it. You compose an email and send it. The other person responds ‘Yes, I got it’. What did you see? Did you notice anything flying? We visualize things to the level that we can imagine. However, there are many processes that we cannot imagine in this nature.\nEarlier, people used post-boxes to deliver letters. Perhaps, that still exists in some villages. People then asked, “Does putting the letter in this box deliver it to my person?” It did. It involved a process where the letters were collected, and grouped based on location. They would be sent there in some vehicle - bus, car or train. They are then sorted, distributed, and delivered to the right addresses. Not all that happens in nature is visually comprehensible for us. Some are visible, but it is stupidity to say that others don’t exist. If the recipient of the offerings in agnihotra (fire ritual) is invisible, that doesn’t mean there is no one. What’s the extent of the power of your eyes? They have limitations. There is a range of distance at which your eyes can perceive objects. Same with light. Eyes cannot see light below and beyond a certain range. Eyes cannot see in extreme light or in extreme darkness. Any sense organ works the same way. Our ears cannot hear above and below a certain frequency of sound. Sound emits. It’s measured in decibels I believe. If the sound emitted is below 5 or above 20 decibels, ears cannot process. It’s not because the sound isn’t there, it’s because of the capacity of the ears. Our tools are limited in their abilities. Eyes, ears and all sense organs are the same way. Can eyes or other sense organs perceive devatas (deities)? No.\nWe must perform yajna (sacrifice) with an intention of an offering. If we do so, it will reap benefits. Yajna (sacrifice) is not the only place where a homa (fire ritual) is performed. Whatever we want to do, it should be done in view of a devata vishesha (specific deity). If you do it that way, it does not bind you. In view of which devata vishesha (specific deity) should we be performing the yajna (sacrifice)? Yajnovai Vishnuhu (Yajna is Vishnu Himself). Some said that it should be done expecting Vishnu as the benefit. Our Elders did not accept that. Yajna (sacrifice) means doing all ordained duties in view of the ultimate One who has given those to you. If you do it this way, it does not bind you. If you do whatever the owner has asked you to do, why would it bind you? The owner has assigned you a task to dismantle something. It is your duty to dismantle something, so it’s not a mistake if you dismantle it. Because that is the prescribed duty. God gave a body for human beings to do their duties. You must do your duties. You must do them with the bhavana (feeling/attitude) of yajna (sacrifice). Why should it be done with the feeling of Yajna (sacrifice)? Arjuna’s biggest question now is why should it be done with the feeling of yajna (sacrifice)? Sri Krishna is explaining the answer beginning with verse 3.10. Gradually learning, let’s move forward.\nVande guruparamparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m lo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nIn Chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna explained how the world came into existence, especially how the pra:ni ko:ti (living beings) come into existence. Accordingly, what becomes the purpose of the pra:ni ko:ti (living beings)? He explained these topics in a few verses beginning with verse 10.\nHow did this [world] emerge? When a woman delivers a baby, nature provides a mechanism for the baby’s growth and nourishment through that very mother. It includes the system that provides required breast milk for the baby. This is the system that is established by God in Nature. This is done through a mother for a child. Similarly, for the entire pra:ni ko:ti (living beings) in this world, it is said that God prescribed and provided a guide. It details the required process for everyone to follow while doing any work, from the time of birth, throughout life. Do any work, i.e., karma (action), transforming it as yajna (sacrificial action). You will attain all that you desire. It does not recommend you to stop doing your work. God did not ask you to set up a yajna kunda (physical structure to perform yajna) and offer oblations. Because ‘yajna’ (sacrificial action) is something that a few people are equipped to do. It involves setting up agniho:thra (a fire altar for offering worship to the devatas), chanting mantras (sacred chants) post learning the process, and requires following rules. There could be a few who will practice all of this. However, it recommends transforming the general activities that everyone does to a yajna (sacrificial action). Arjuna wondered why it is recommended to perform work as yajna (sacrificial action). Sri Krishna is answering that in verse 10. At the time of srushti (universal manifestation), God sent souls to the world along with yajnas (sacrificial actions).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsaha yajnaihi praja: srustva: puro:va:cha praja:pathihi\nane:na prasavishwadhvam e:savo:shtu ishta ka:madukh\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAt the time of universal manifestation, Praja:pathi (God) created beings along with yajnas (sacrificial actions), saying, \"May you prosper through these yajnas, and may they fulfill all your desires.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nHumans have desires. In fact, every being has desires. However, there are differences between the desires of a human being versus that of others. Other beings have only two desires. First - to eat the food it wants. Second - to grow and live without fear. They know only of these two. They don’t require anything else. They live properly desiring these two needs. They eat only what they are supposed to. They also eat only how much they should. They live in the way they should. You can observe birds, animals, worms, insects, etc. They live properly not going beyond whatever is ordained to them. If there is any living being that does not limit itself to rules, it’s human beings only. There are no ethics, rules or regulations. Human beings are the ones living without any of this. A ‘superior’ being!\nHuman beings have desires too. Other beings just need food, live without fear, and thus arrange for a required environment. The way they achieve this is through grouping and moving together with their fellow beings. Birds, deer and other animals do it. This is to live without fear. For food, they hunt. They eat what they get. If they are successful, they eat. Otherwise, they fast. Just because they can’t get what they are looking for, they don’t eat unnecessary waste. They don’t cry over anyone or fight with anyone. They live by themselves quietly and lead their lives. This is the case with other beings.\nWith human beings, that’s not how it is. There is nothing that is not useful for human beings. There is nothing that is not fit to be eaten by him. Give him anything. He will somehow make it edible, conveys thanks to the giver, and eats. You can give anything that is rotten, spoiled, or destroyed, or that destroys when eaten… If you don’t give, he will fight and grab it. At times, he doesn’t eat what he takes. He ensures no one else also eats. He piles it up. He doesn’t know how long he wants it saved. He doesn’t know how long it can be saved. He just does it to satisfy himself with the thought that he has a lot of it. He leaves the body at some time, not knowing what will happen to it after that. However, for as long as he is there, he earns and earns like an insatiable bandicoot-rat. He only eats very little but he wants to earn more and more for his people. Some don’t even do it for their people. They just earn. This is what he desires.\nHumans should not be this way. Like animals which earn suitable food in the recommended manner, you also do the same. Additionally, humans are given a superior faculty, the intellect (buddhi). Hence, use your intellect (buddhi) properly. What should we use it for? The provider need not know about it. Animals do not ever say ‘thank you’ to who has fed them. If you feed a cow, it eats and stays quiet. It does not say ‘very happy for this…’ This is something a human being says. Do you know why? To say that he liked what’s being given and that he wants it again tomorrow! If the recipient does not smile and appreciate what’s being given, the giver does not bring it again. He wants it again. Hence, he expresses gratitude and satisfaction. Then, one who is giving it will bring the same or better again. This is a human being. This is not the case with animals. Put aside whether monkeys are our ancestors. Even if so, monkeys also do not have those qualities. Give it a mango, banana or something. It will eat right in front of you and throw away the peel. It will go back on its way. It does not say thank you for the sake of getting another fruit. If you are holding another fruit with you, it will forcibly take that fruit from you if you don’t give it. It even scratches you in order to take it. They don’t have a habit of saying thanks. Human beings have that habit. Why does he have that habit? Because he wants it again. They don’t look for you to be the source for food tomorrow. They roam around and find food. They eat if they get or they fast if they don’t get. This is their life.\nHuman beings are given intellect (buddhi). They are given intellect (buddhi) to use appropriately.\nvyavasa:thmika: buddhi (develop a focused mind on a single-goal)\nNot bahusa:kha (spread and varied). He explained this in Chapter 2. What is it that must be done to utilize it properly? Whatever duties that are ordained to you, i.e., whatever are prescribed as right for you, transform them as yajna (sacrificial action) and perform them. You don’t need to stop doing work or give them any makeover. However, ensure that whatever work you are doing is yajna (sacrificial action). If you feel like eating something, do whatever pre-activities need to be done and recognize that the source of food is God, and that you are offering it to the indwelling God. Then, have it. You don’t have to stop doing what you have to. Just change the way you feel about it and do it. If you don’t do this, what is the purpose of buddhi (intellect) that is given to you? What is it that must be done with the buddhi (intellect) given to you? Any object must do what it’s made for, isn’t it? In addition to being able to carry out life normally, human beings have unique intellect (buddhi) compared to the others. Hence, invoke with that thought and do it as yajna (sacrificial action). If you do things this way, you will attain anything you desire. Whatever you desire, will be fulfilled. This is what God says.\nsaha yajnaihi (along with yajnas)\npraja:srustva: (God created every being)\npuro:va:cha praja:pathihi (Praja:pathi said before)\npura (before) + uva:cha (said)\nWhenever srushti (creation) took place… Not everyone gets created at the same time. Each being might have come into existence at different times. That’s fine. We weren’t there when grandfathers were born. They weren’t there when their grandfathers were born. They came into existence then. We came now. We may not be around tomorrow, the time period for the next generation. That’s okay. Whoever it is, for them - praja:pathi hi uva:cha (Praja:pathi said). Someone created them. Who did so? Praja:pathi (Lord of creatures). One is Chathurmukha Brahma (four-faced Brahma). He is called Praja:pathi (Lord of creatures). Narayana, who created all the praja:pathis (Lords of creatures), is also called Praja:pathi (Lord of creatures). Srimad Bhagavatam eulogized Varaha Swami who uplifted mother Earth as Praja:pathi (Lord of creatures).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nanuma:na:th thadurttha:ram karthuka:maha praja:pathihi\ntho:ya:nthasttha:m mahi:m jna:thva: jagathi e:ka:rnavi:kruthe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen the entire world was submerged in a single ocean (during dissolution), Praja:pathi (God) resolved to uplift the Earth, knowing it was submerged in water.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen everything was in pralaya sa:gara (ocean of dissolution)… When the entire Earth was drowned in water…. It starts with, “Praja:pathi (Lord of creatures) resolved to uplift mother Earth…” Praja:pathi (Lord of creatures) is God. He took an avatar (incarnation) at that time for that purpose. What is that avatar (incarnation) called? Bhuvaraha Avatar. God is also called Praja:pathi (Lord of creatures).\nHowever, there is a process in which srushti (creation) takes place. Adwaraka Srushti (direct creation) and Sadwaraka Srushti (indirect creation). It’s a beautiful process as described in Puranas (ancient scriptures). Adwaraka Srushti (direct creation) is when there is nothing and God takes a sankalpa (vow).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthadaikshatha bahusya: praja: ey:ey:thi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe (God) took a vow, \"May I become many, may I create beings.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nAs He takes that sankalpa (vow), srushti (creation) takes place.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthath srustva: thade:va:nupra:visathu thadanupravisya\nsatyathyjyabhavathu niruktham cha niruktham cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHaving created that, He entered into it. Having entered, He became the manifest and the unmanifest.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe brings out panchabhutas (five elements of Nature) from Himself. He divides them in a specific manner. He divides prithvi (earth) into halves. He divides one half into four parts and mixes one each with the rest of bhutas (elements). He keeps the second half aside. He takes jala (water) into halves. He divides one of the two halves into four parts. He mixes one each of the four parts with the remaining four bhutas (elements). Thus, each bhuta’s (element's) composition contains only half of itself as the ‘core bhuta (element)’. The other half contains equal portions of the remaining bhutas (elements). Together they make srushti (manifestation). Into this, He sends a Brahma, a Praja:pathi (Lord of creatures). He dwells within him and does srushti (creation) through him. He doesn’t do anything directly post this. Whatever He does prior to creating Brahma is a beautiful process. It involves mixing calculated portioned panchabhutas (five elements of Nature) together and is called panchikaranam (process of mixing elements). The srushti (creation) He does up until panchikaranam (process of mixing elements) is called adwaraka srushti (direct creation). He creates Brahma, dwells within him, and appoints him to do the rest. This is done through him. So, it is called sadwaraka srushti (indirect creation). It can be creation, protection or dissolution. Whatever it is. Whatever He does is both direct and indirect. When He does the indirect creation, the first one in it is called Praja:pathi (Lord of creatures). That one can be referred to as Praja:pathi (Lord of creatures). There are not one, but hundreds of andas (universes). Because it is God who ordered all of them too…\npraja:pathihi uva:cha pura (Praja:pathi said before)\nAt the beginning of this time period, He is the one who created them along with yajnas (sacrificial actions) informing that they will be useful to them. “Happily, attain what you desire with the help of them [yajnas (sacrificial actions)].” Saying so, He created. The process of srushti (creation) incorporated yajnas (sacrificial actions) as part of creating pra:ni ko:ti (all creatures). Oh human being, you have also come into existence in the same process. So, use the yajnas (sacrificial actions) and uplift yourselves. You may say you don’t know how to perform a yajna (sacrificial action). Not necessary. Transform whatever work is ordained to you as a yajna (sacrificial action) and perform it. Through Arjuna, Sri Krishna teaches us the process to transform execution of karma (action) into yajna (sacrificial action). He starts this from Chapter 3, verse 10.\nVande Guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m lo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham (I bow again and again to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, grants all wealth, and delights the world).\nIn Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, God gives a beautiful answer to the question, ‘Is it right to ask for desires?’ Yes, one can wish or ask. And yes, one can fulfill the wishes sought for. However, they have to be following the right order. One must seek or wish for desires that are in the right order. The way one fulfills the desires also must be following the right order. He did not say that it is wrong to ask for desires. It is wrong for one to seek certain desires. It is also wrong if one does not seek certain desires.\nlo:ka: samastha: sukhino:bhavanthu (May the entire world be happy). Is this not a desire one must seek? What is the purpose of one’s life in the world if he is not wishing for such desire? “Doesn’t matter what happens to the one next to me, I should have a full stomach.” This is wrong. It is wrong to have such desires. The entire world should be happy. There should be timely rains.\nsvasthi praja:bhya paripa:layantha:m nya:yye:na ma:rge:na mahi:m mahi:sha:ha go:bra:mhane:bhaya:scha subhamasthu nithyam (May the rulers govern the earth righteously for the welfare of the people. May there always be auspiciousness for cows and Brahmins).\nIf one does not wish for such desires, what is the purpose of that life? What is the purpose of any knowledge that he has? One can wish. Some must be wished for. Some must not be wished for. It is wrong if one wishes for those that should not be wished for. It is wrong if one does not wish those that should be wished for.\nLet’s say there is a family of five. One can be called a member of the family if he wishes well for all of them. If he does not care what happens to them and wants to live for himself, and go as per his wishes, he will cease to be a member of that family. Wonder whether we, as human beings of this world, have desires or not?\ne:shavo:sthu ista ka:ma dukh (happily, get all that you desire). In the third chapter, God freely gives this blank cheque! Seek all the desires that you want. How do you get those desires fulfilled? All the means are outlined here [in Bhagavad Gita]. Use them. He said it. What are they?\nane:na prasayishvathvam (squeeze all that you want through this).\ne:shavo:sthu (may this become that for you).\nAs what?\nishta ka:ma dukh (may it become the means through which you can fulfill all the desires you may have).\nWhat is that?\nsaha yajne: praja: srustva: puro:va:cha praja:pathi hi (Prajapati spoke first, creating beings along with yajnas).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsaha-yajñāḥ prajāḥ sṛṣṭvā purovāca prajāpatiḥ\nanena prasaviṣyadhvam eṣa vo 'stv iṣṭa-kāma-dhuk\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn the beginning of creation, Prajapati (the Lord of all creatures) created mankind along with sacrifices (yajnas) and said: \"Be fruitful by this (yajna), and let this (yajna) be the fulfiller of all your desires.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nPrajapati (the ultimate cause of this world, Adi Narayana).\ne:ko:vahai na:ra:yana a:si:th na bramha: ne:sa:naha name:dya prudhivi: na:nthariksham e:ko:vahai na:ra:yana a:si:th (There was only One Narayana. Neither Brahma, nor Shiva, nor this earth, nor the sky existed. There was only One Narayana). All those we hear of later were not in existence then!\ne:kame:va advithi:yam (One without a second). Upanishads also clarified this. What did He do? He thought of giving form to these worlds from within Himself. After He thought of this, He manifested Brahma. Then, He manifested the rest too. How? He clarifies this in chapter 3, verse 10.\nsaha yajnaihi praja: srustva: (He brought forth this jiva koti (section of souls), along with the yajnas). Let us put the rest of jiva koti (section of souls) aside, put a boundary and think about us, the human beings. Let us think praja (human beings) means human beings for now. He created all of us in conjunction with yajnas. For what purpose?\nane:na prasavishvadhvam (You might want many things. Whatever you want, get them with the help of this [yajna]). Whatever you want, it will give you that. You might have heard the name, Kamadhenu (wish-fulfilling cow). It is a wonderful cow. It is not the kind that we see these days, that which can’t moo or that without a hump. Kamadhenu (wish-fulfilling cow) is not that kind of cow. It is the gomata (motherly cow) with a nice dewlap, a gangadolu (dewlap), and makes everyone happy with its call amba (moo). It is that kind of motherly cow. What does it do? It provides food when one is hungry. If anyone has other desires, it satiates them. It is named Kamadhenu (wish-fulfilling cow). Kalpavriksha (wish-fulfilling tree) and Chintamani (wish-fulfilling gem) also provide for things in the same way. Our people listed a few such ones. Like a cow that gives the milk when one desires for it, similarly, yajna is like a good Kamadhenu (wish-fulfilling cow). It will provide for whatever you desire. Happily, ask for what you want. You will have desires. There must be someone to grant those desires. That is why, I created both you and those yajnas which will grant you the desires you have. Use them properly. Chapter 3 states this.\nane:na prasayishyadvam e:shavo:sthu ishta ka:ma dukh (Let this give you what you want). Thus, God is not saying that it is wrong to have desires. You must transform your activities into yajnas. This is very important. You must transform your karma (actions), activities into yajna. This is the key concept you must recognize. What does it mean to transform something into yajna? We learnt this in the past. Doing it (activity) as deva aradhana (worship of God). Feeling it as daivaradhana (worship of God).\n“Why should I worship God?” “I don’t even believe in God.” It is said that our senses work because of a specific devata vishesha (specific divine being) in God’s administration. Our manas (mind) works because of Soma (Moon god). Our buddhi (intellect) works because of some other devata (divine being). Our desires work because of some devata (divine being). Our tongue because of some other devata (divine being). Our eyes because of some other devata (divine being). The ears because of another devata (divine being). Our skin works because of another devata (divine being). Each and every element of the body works because of the effect of a specific devata (divine being). If that devata (divine being) steps aside, the specific tool or part of the body stops working. This is in one body. It is the same in the universal body too. Whatever enables working here [in your body] also enables working of all other beings in the world. If it does not wish to, that particular part stops working.\n“This is all nonsense. We don’t believe in all these devatas (divine beings).” “Don’t believe in the so-called demigods.” They are not demigods. They are responsible for your survival. They are the base for your life. We think devatas (divine beings) are those wearing silk clothes with gold crowns, gold ornaments, going around holding some weapon. This is a common perception because of our strong association with movies. They show devatas (divine beings) to be such beings wandering in the sky. We therefore think that devatas (divine beings) are to be seen that way in the sky. People tend to try locating them and say that they can’t see such beings. Devatas (divine beings) do not mean only that type of beings. Maybe such beings exist. Let’s not deny it till we see the whole universe. That is anyway not possible for us. Therefore, since we cannot see them, let’s leave that. All the invisible natural forces around you that are the basis for your life are all devatas (divine beings) existing in the form of tejas (radiant energy). Do we not have the responsibility to take care of them? Air, water, heat, cold. Take these four examples. Why four, let’s take two. Air and water. Air. Is it essential to you or not? Can you see it? Does it abide by what you say? Is it depending on you for its survival? Or are you depending on it for your survival? Should you behave in accordance with it or should it be in accordance with you? Did we think about this at least once? Air is one devata vishesha (specific divine being). What does that mean? It does not sit stable at a place. Devatas (divine beings) are said to have two types of powers. It seems that they never lose their youth. They are named tridasa (always appearing thirty years old), looking like thirty years old all the time. The second one is that they never touch the ground. They are always one gaja (unit of measurement, about three feet) above the ground. Third one is that they don’t have eyelids. They plucked them off? They don’t ever feel sleepy. Therefore, they are always working. They have these three qualities. One is satata sancharam (always moving), always on the move. The other is not touching the ground. The next one is not sleepy ever. Let us think about air. If air ever sleeps, what happens? Because air has no eyelids, no sleep and no vision. If it sleeps for 10 minutes. Forget about 10 minutes, let’s say it sleeps for half a minute. It says that it won’t go to anyone. In our childhood, people used to tell a story. It’s about Anjaneya Swami (Lord Hanuman). When Anjaneya Swami (Lord Hanuman) jumps up to the sky to reach the Sun, it seems he was beaten by someone who got angry. He fell, got hurt. His father, the wind devata (divine being) got angry. It seems he simply held up everything. The entire world went hustling and bustling. Starting from Brahma (the creator god), everyone reached him and thought about what they could do. Anything that they could do to help the boy thereby pleasing the wind devata (divine being). Brahma (the creator god) said that his astra (divine weapon) would not do the job. Indra (king of devatas) said that his astra (divine weapon) would also not do the job. Varuna (god of water) said that he would not have any hurdle in water. Whoever is called a devata (divine being) gave the boy all his powers. Everyone gave all kinds of boons. That’s when wind devata (divine being) felt pleased. He then released his abilities. Everyone could then breathe! If wind devata (divine being) withdraws for half a minute, the entire world is a ‘gone case’. Therefore, no eyelids [meaning always working]! How about never touching the ground? He is not one who touches the ground. Does wind sit at a place? No. Therefore, he is someone who does not touch the ground. Does wind ever get old? We are inhaling the same air that Krishna once inhaled. Going back in time, we are inhaling the same air that Rama once inhaled. How fortunate are we? Also, we are inhaling the same air that Ravanasura (the demon king Ravana) inhaled. We are also inhaling the same air that Shishupala (a king) inhaled. We don’t know if that is also fortunate or not! Air never gets old, always tridasaha (always thirty years old), 30 years old. Air is only an example. We can also take water. Whatever water body that Rama drank from or crossed, we are able to have the same water. Whatever water Krishna used, the same… Whatever land that He moved around, we are moving on the same land. What does getting old for water mean? The same water gets recycled. Oceans form clouds. Clouds give rain. Rains convert into rivers, lakes, wells. That water comes in our use. They go back to the earth. They reach the ocean. It forms clouds and circulates. Water never gets old. Therefore devatas (divine beings) are always tridasaha (always thirty years old), 30 years. They are always in the tejas (radiant energy) form. They do not sleep. Such beings are called devatas (divine beings). All the forces in nature are devatas (divine beings). You are able to live because of them. Therefore, if you look after them properly, they will look after you well.\nsaha yajnaihi (Whatever work you are doing, do it in a way that does not bother them). They will become wish-givers like Kamadhenu (wish-fulfilling cow). Swami, the Lord gives knowledge of this and moves forward.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBhagavad Gita chapter 3 tells everyone to feel everything we do as yajna (sacrifice). God did not say to transform everything to yajna (sacrifice). He says to dress them up with a feel of yajna (sacrifice) and surrender them. There are different types of activities people do. Different beings do different things. A doctor, if necessary, will cut through the body with a knife and stitch. A mother feeds and raises [kids]. A guru (teacher) teaches lessons and makes one learn. One is an ornament maker. One is a weapon maker. Another makes a variety of instruments. One digs the ground and brings out minerals. Each one has different kinds of work.\nThe person doing the work may not always like it. Or others may not find that work befitting to them. A doctor cuts through the body, separates the parts, cleans up and puts them together to keep the diseased healthy. Even if the diseased person is related to us, we feel disgusted seeing all that. However, a doctor does not feel disgusted about it. It is his goal and job to clean up the body to keep the person in good condition. Therefore, whatever we human beings do may not be something we always like. Even if we are doing our responsibility, we may not like it. Or what others are doing may not seem like a very happy thing to do. Do not care about whether the work is something favorable or unfavorable, giving happiness or sorrow. Cover it with a beautiful layer. That [layer] is called yajna (sacrifice).\nPharmacologists design a cover called a capsule to hold the medicine that does not taste good. Capsule looks interesting to the eyes. Medicine is put inside it. The bitterness or the taste of the medicine doesn’t even touch us. It is embedded in a capsule that looks attractive. We look at the capsule and take the medicine in. The medicine does its job after it reaches in. We all know this. It “gives” the benefit required. Similarly, if we desire that everything we do becomes favorable to us, benefitting us, cover it with a beautiful capsule called yajna (sacrifice). Because you are sent to this world so you can work that way.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsaha yajnaihi praja:ha: srustva\npuro:vacha praja:pathihi\nane:na prathiyishvadhvam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI told you how to do everything as yajna (sacrifice). It will give you what you desire.\n-----------------------------------------------\nEverything a human being desires is from this world. He doesn’t desire anything beyond this world. He may seek money. It is from nature. He may seek power. It is from nature. He may seek health or food to eat or people. Whatever he desires is from this world. Nothing he seeks is beyond this world. This world is filled with de:vathas (divine beings/natural forces). It is made of many kinds of powers. I sent you along with them. Therefore, stay together. Live such that you and they benefit from one other. Better yourselves.\nde:va:n bha:vayatha (respect them properly)\nWhom?\nde:vathas (divine beings/natural forces)\n[You say] I don’t believe in de:vathas (divine beings/natural forces). De:vathas (divine beings/natural forces) are not some dolls or deities that are placed somewhere. Every surrounding power that is helping your survival is a de:vatha (divine being/natural force). The earth that is supporting you to stand is a de:vatha (divine being/natural force). The atmospheric pressure that is keeping you intact without which your body may rip apart is a de:vatha (divine being/natural force). If you are able to talk, it’s because of a de:vatha (divine being/natural force). If you are able to listen, that’s because of another de:vatha (divine being/natural force). If you are able to see, it’s because of a de:vatha (divine being/natural force). If you are able to breathe, that’s because of another de:vatha (divine being/natural force). We know that every inch in this body is working because of the powers in nature. All those powers are called de:vathas (divine beings/natural forces). Therefore, don’t we have the responsibility to take care of them respectfully?\nde:va:n bha:vayatha (behave properly with respect to them)\nWhat happens when you do that?\nthe: de:va: bha:vayanthu vaha (Because of the work you do that is dressed up as yajna (sacrifice), by this, all the de:vathas (divine beings/natural forces) in nature will work in your favor). They have the power to keep you alive. They will keep you alive. However, you have some responsibility towards them. There is something that they should do for you.\nparasparam bha:vayanthaha (mutual)\nUse your abilities for their betterment. They will give what is good for you.\nparasparam bha:vayanthaha (being utilized for each other's benefit)\nsre:yah param ava:psyatha (both of you can prosper together)\nYou have one limitation. They have one limitation. What will you do? You will give the other whatever you have in surplus. You will take from the other whatever they have in surplus. Back in the past, there was something called a barter system. One grows vegetables and the other grows rice. He doesn’t have rice, and the other doesn’t have vegetables. Each of them exchange their products. The other one has a tamarind tree. He has tamarind seeds. However, he doesn’t have any vegetables or rice. He will offer tamarind seeds to both of them. He will ask for rice and vegetables from them. He will use his yield for their sake. They will use their yield for his sake.\nparasparam bha:vayantha (being utilized for each other's benefit)\nparam sre:yaha ava:psyutha (all of you reap the best together)\nWhen we water a plant, it gives the nourishing water back to us. You know a coconut tree.\npratthama vayasa pi:tham tho:yam alpam smaranthaha (Says one who studies ni:thi sa:stra (ethical scriptures, moral codes)). As a kid, we sowed a coconut seed. It became a sapling. Whatever unusable water we have, we watered it with that. That’s all we did. After watering that way for some while, it grew to a big tree. What is it doing now? It remembers the water you gave. It forgot that it was muddy or unusable. He gave me water when I was young. I grew up because of the favor he did. He became the base for my life. It feels that it should return the favor. (Thinking thus) It holds the weight on its head and yields a bunch of about 15 coconuts to us. We cut and use them. It starts thinking and begins to yield again with new produce. It thinks that it didn’t do much for whatever you did. It continues to yield every season. The person doesn’t have anything to give now. He might even think about cutting the tree and taking everything from it. It remembers the small favor received when tiny, and does so much in return. Every tree in nature is the same way. Every bird is the same way. Every insect or worm is the same way. In fact, it is they who are doing favors. All we do is harm them. At least, we should not do that.\nde:va:n bha:vayatha (respect them with care)\nWe stopped doing this. We stopped showing reciprocal regard to de:vathas (divine beings/natural forces). However, the: de:va:ha bha:vayanthaha (they have not stopped being gracious to us). Because they believe in the One who is giving them. He instructed them a procedure to give. That’s it. They are all following the instruction passed to them. However, we don’t have it towards them. Because of Coronavirus, all the atrocities we do with respect to nature have come into light in the world. People realized it then but the question of whether it is still in their minds is another million dollar one.\nWhen the lockdown was imposed for the first time… All the rivers were flowing clean and pure. The oceans… all clean and blue. The sky… all beautiful and clear. All the birds… flying happily. Animals… roaming around freely and happily. Air pollution… decreased. Everyone became so happy. It didn’t stay that way for long… that’s a different thing. A dog’s tail is always curled.. A human’s intellect is…\nna jaha:thi sunah puccham na:mitha:m vakratha:m dhruvam (A dog's tail never gives up its inherent crookedness). As soon as the lockdown was lifted, everyone lined up for miles at the liquor stores. Everything began as usual. Pollution started spreading in nature again.\nLeave aside de:vathas (divine beings/natural forces). You may or may not believe in them. Don’t you believe in nature that is the base of your life here? You are chemically polluting the earth that is giving you food. What will it give you back? You are contaminating the water that gives you life. What will you drink and live? You are releasing poisonous and dangerous gases into the air that is giving you life. What will you breathe and live? Bacteria, fungi, insects or worms are all supporting your existence. If you are harming them, how are you supposed to lead your life? If they are well, you will be well. If they grow properly, you will also grow properly. Therefore, you must take care of them for the sake of your life, not out of pity, compassion or mercy. You can’t see with your eyes how they are and how they work. So, they are named de:va (divine).\nde:va:n bha:vayatha (respect them with care)\nRespect all the forces of nature. The One who has all the forces of nature as His body is Narayana (Lord Narayana). Therefore, these are all various parts of His body. All the names you hear such as Indra, Varuna, Vayu, Ishana, Kubera, Yama, Shiva. Let’s think that all of these denote similar forces.\nsa a:thma: anga:n nanya: de:vatha: a:ha (the One who is the supporter of all these… all these are His various parts). He is the angi (main body), the body. Therefore, everything you do should align with their welfare and not interfere with their existence.\nthe: de:va:ha bha:vayanthu vaha (Then, the divine body of God in the form of various powers in nature gives you what you need).\nparasparam bha:vayanthaha (with mutual use for each other)\nsre:yah parama vapsyattha (better yourselves)\nYou should be doing good. God should bestow His grace upon us always. We should also always worship God. The worship you do should not be limited to offering flowers to the deity. Turn everything you do in this way. This is called yoga (union). Karma yoga (yoga of action). God is clarifying this in chapter 3, verse 11.\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of gurus)"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nEveryone born as human beings must live by working hard properly and happily. Must work and live. Should not think of just eating. Should not wait for someone else to do something for you. One must lead life carrying out recommended activities and use money that is rightly earned. While leading life this way, the rule is that one must transform his life in a way such that it does not obstruct the dharma (righteous conduct) of the rest of the species and Nature.\nWe established a principle for Vikasa Tarangini. Generally, everyone says “Service to humanity is service to God.” Maybe it was necessary at some point in history. We do not know who said it and why. However, Vedas, Upanishads or any such literature did not limit service to God with service to humanity. It is not just human beings who live in this world. A human being is able to live not because of human beings but because of the rest of the beings. Therefore, human beings must always be grateful to the rest of the beings. For the existence of human beings, animals are cooperating. Birds, animals, insects, worms are cooperating. Ache:thana (non-living) beings such as air, water are cooperating. Trees are cooperating. In fact, everything in the world is cooperating for [the survival] of human beings. However, wretched human beings are not using their life for the protection of all of those beings.\nWe all know that it is human beings who are polluting water. It is human beings who are polluting the air. It is human beings who are polluting the earth. It is human beings who cut trees beyond need. Other species kill their prey to satiate hunger needs. They stop at that. However, human beings are destroying other beings in multiples of hundreds, thousands, lakhs, and crores. Wild animals like tiger, lion, wolf or fox kill some animals in order to satiate their needs. We don’t know how much and what human beings need to satiate hunger however, human beings have the worst and most horrible attitude of destroying them beyond their needs. Therefore, God probably will not be happy regarding such a human being. Because if all species are God’s children, will any father be happy if one child destroys another? Human beings are one among all the children [of God]. If they are horribly hurting and destroying the rest of the beings, will God be happy about it? That is why, Service to humanity alone is not service to God.\nSo, what do we do? If human beings must survive properly, the rest of the beings should be living well. Isn’t it? You need not leave human beings out. You need not eliminate or disregard human beings. However, properly protect the rest of the beings which are all supporting the survival of human beings, not out of pity for them or out of following certain righteous principles but out of realizing them to be different parts of God, the base of your survival. Thus, protect them.\nSome people say, “I love God deeply. My devotion overflows in gallons and gallons.” Very happy about it. Because he loves God, he goes to temples. He has deities. He worships God. He offers food. He does mantra japa (chanting mantra with count). He does a variety of things. However, if someone is in pain or if there is a disaster somewhere, he says all that is not related to him. We need to understand the scope of his perception of God. Why? If the universe is God’s body, the one who is in pain is one of the parts of the body. The place where a disaster took place is also another part of the body. If you really love God, where should you be expressing that love?\nLet’s say you deeply love a person. You feel like garlanding him. Where do you place it? Do you say, “Leave your body there and come to me, I will garland you.”? We don’t. We garland the body. The person also accepts it through the body. Will he say, “Why did you garland my body? I would have come out.” If he comes out, we run away. We don’t garland. We respect him through the body. Whatever he wants to do for us, he will do so through the body. If you really love God, you try to identify where in His divine universal body there is a need and serve Him there. That is when you really have belief and love for God. Yes. To recharge and live this bha:vana (feeling/sentiment) properly, you can worship God in deity form which is His visible and another form. However, you should utilize the inspiration you get there [at deity] when you go into the society. This should become an inspiration center. That should become a place for utilizing it. Instead, if one says I only believe that and not this, he cannot be considered fully knowledgeable. Or if he says I only believe this and not that, he is also not someone who has devotion for God. All this is God’s divine body. Every object you see in Nature is His body. Every power you see in this nature is also His body. It is all the supporting base for our existence. Therefore, you should have a proper understanding of them all. When you are serving them with that understanding, you should know that it is reaching God.\nIf you offer a few grains to a bird and know that it is through that bird you are serving the indwelling God, that is worshiping God. Feed an animal but feed it with a feeling of worshiping the indwelling God. That satisfies God. Ensure water remains uncontaminated but do it as worship to God who is in the form of water. God will be happy about that too. Clear air of all pollutants. Clean the dirt on the land as worship to God to please God there. That is also something God will be satisfied about. Therefore, “Service to humanity alone is not service to God”. As service to God, service must be done to all beings. This is the main principle of Vikasa Tarangini. A Motto! “Serve all beings as service to God”.\nKrishna is clarifying this from verse 10 of chapter 3. Also, in verse 11.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndeva:n bha:vayatha:ne:na the: de:va: bha:vayanthu vaha |\nparasparam bha:vayanthaha sre:yah param ava:psyattha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBy this, you nourish the divine beings, and may those divine beings nourish you. By nourishing each other, you will attain the highest good.\n-----------------------------------------------\nMay everyone attain the good kshe:ma (well-being), all the well-being. Arjuna asked how.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nishta:n bho:ga:n hi vo: de:va:ha da:syanthe: yajna bha:vitha:ha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe divine beings, nourished by yajna (sacrificial action), will indeed grant you the desired enjoyments.\n-----------------------------------------------\nEvery activity you take up, every movement you make, everything you do, do it as yajna (sacrificial action/worship). We must remember what yajna means. It is not limited to what is done using a ho:ma kunda (fire-altar). That is one type of yajna. In everything we do, the mind should be in a mode of worshiping God [through it]. If it is used as a casing for Him, yajna bha:vitha:ha (nourished by yajna). Then, da:syanthe: (they will give). If you offer [service] to de:vathas (divine beings) this way through the yajna that you do, they will be satisfied with it. the: da:syanthe: (they will happily give you) ishta:n bho:ga:n (whatever you desire).\nIn yajna processes, there is one method done that gives whatever one desires. Example is the desire for good health. That part is called ishti (ritual for specific desires). Dasarattha performed an ishti, Putraka:ma ishti (ritual for desiring a child), desiring for a child. Ishti, that which fulfills a desire. Through the powers in nature, Ishti gives what we desire. Dasarattha performed putraka:me:shti and took yajna prasa:da (sanctified offerings from yajna). It was then that the powers of Nature blessed him with eligibility for having children. He had children later.\nDe:vathas (divine beings) never give or deliver something to you like a package from the postal department, FedEx or courier. That’s not how they do it. Then, how do they work?\nna de:va: yashtima:da:ya rakshanthi pasu pa:lavath (Divine beings do not protect by holding a stick like a cowherd).\nOne who takes animals out for grazing holds a stick and uses it to put them on a path. De:vathas (divine beings) never do something like that. Then, how do they work? They will trigger something in someone surrounding you. That person gives you a suggestion or gives you something or shows you a path or accompanies you. God inspires someone for it and gets it done. Because we are very arrogant, we suppress the feeling that it is an act of God. We think that it is all because of our own power. “I am so smart. I chose the right person and that’s how I got the right suggestion”. If it was you, why couldn’t you have done the same yesterday, or day before or a year ago? You would have benefited long ago. Why did you get hold of that person now? So, despite God being the giver, we put Him aside and impose everything onto ourselves. We are trying to steal the show.\nTo support the fulfillment of your desires, they, ishta:n bho:ga:n hi vo: de:va:ha (the divine beings will indeed grant you the desired enjoyments). Through all the de:vathas (divine beings) bodying Him, God will give what you desire for.\nIf you go a little further, God states it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naham hi sarva yajna:na:m bho:ktha:cha prabhure:va cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIndeed, I am the enjoyer and the Lord of all yajnas (sacrifices).\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhatever anyone desires for, I am the giver. I am the one who receives whatever they do too. bho:ktha: cha prabhure:va cha (I am the enjoyer and the Lord). I am the one who ensures that all the work progresses and that they yield good results. That is what is being explained.\nDespite receiving [desires] from the de:vathas (divine beings) this way but does not serve them, he is a bigtime thief. He is taking what is being given but does not give what he is supposed to. Isn’t that wrong and a sin? Such a person becomes worthy of punishment.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthair dattha:ha na prada:yaibhyaha yo: bhunkthe: sthe:na e:va saha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe who enjoys what is given by them (divine beings) without offering anything in return is indeed a thief.\n-----------------------------------------------\nA tree gave you fruits and you happily relished the pickle made out of them. However, you are resisting from watering it. Won’t you be called a thief? Aren’t you stealing from it? Air is giving you so much of pra:na shakthi (life energy). During the time of coronavirus, we have seen how dangerous it is when there is no supply of even a liter of it. How many recommendations people sought [for it]! [By default] You are given the chance to breathe happily 24 hours without any break. Aren’t we responsible for preserving the air properly? Aren’t we responsible for not adding pollutants to it? Therefore, thair dattha: ha (you are taking what they are giving), na prada:yaibhyaha (you are not giving what you are supposed to), yo: bhunkthe: (whoever receives them), sthe:na e:va saha (he is only a thief). Understand this and behave properly. What an important warning God is giving out! Even for today and in these times, it is very relevant and suitable. We have the responsibility of making a note of this when we read Bhagavad Gi:tha (Bhagavad Gita), chapter 3. Let’s try to do it.\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of gurus)."

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIn Chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita, God instructs to lead life as yajna (selfless action/offering). There are some yajnas (selfless actions) that can be done by everyone. There are some yajnas (selfless actions) that can be done by a few. Those who study Vedas perform yajna (selfless action) in a process. Those who have a desire to fulfill have another process to follow to perform yajna (selfless action). There is one yajna (selfless action) that everyone can perform. In Chapter 3, God is clarifying that yajna (selfless action) which everyone can perform irrespective of differences. Because every human being is born along with yajna (selfless action). Therefore, they must lead life performing yajnas (selfless actions). One must not remove the sheath of yajna (selfless action) from any type of work that he does. In other words, we need a casing for every work we do. If that is gone, then the work you do becomes that which binds you.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is meant by yajna (selfless action)? It is devatha aradhana (worship of divine forces). Who are the devathas (divine forces)? They are those (divine forces of Nature) who exist as parts of God’s body.\nangani anyaha devathaha sa athma (The divine forces are His parts, He is the Soul)\nWho is that atma (Soul)? There are many scriptures that reveal srusti prakriya (the process of Creation), Upanishads, Vedas, Ithihasas, Puranas, Agamas. In all these, they described the process of creation clearly with no room for any questions. God out of compassion, from a sthana (abode) named pralayarnava (ocean of dissolution)…\nso kamayatha (He desired)\nHe began to manifest these worlds. To do so, He took on 4 forms. Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha. Vasudeva is the controlling abode of the remaining. It is called controlling abode. Sankarshana is the abode where all that exists is absorbed into. When it is time for everything that was once absorbed to be given a body… there is an abode named Aniruddha which prepares an environment for giving bodies from Himself. There is an abode where everything that has emerged gets regulated from. That is called Pradyumna. They are the four sthanas (abodes). They are named vyuhas (emanations). They are referred to as Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha. Who is the one in these forms? Narayana. The Narayana as ekarnavasayi (one who rests on the primordial ocean) turns these four forms into vyuhas (emanations) in Him. He runs one task each from each [vyuha (emanation)] and governs the whole universe. We don’t know how many times this runs. He brings forth all the souls, giving opportunities to clear themselves from their sins/faults. He supports these souls to attain such a state that they don’t need to come to this world again. However, some end up adding more and more to their backlog instead of clearing it. In such cases where one doesn’t utilize the opportunity given… He will give another opportunity taking away the current form. This act is named pralaya (dissolution). He does not do this out of anger, revenge. He does so out of compassion and pity. Laya krutya (the act of dissolution) is also an act of compassion. Scriptures declare it. He draws them back, later creates [bodies and assigns them souls], governs them properly. When He thinks it’s no longer useful, He will draw them back [again]. This cycle continues to run. It is He who governs all of it. The governing One is Narayana alone. He is doing all of this out of compassion. The only being who can recognize it is a human being. It seems there are many species. People say 84 lakh (hundreds of thousands) varieties of species. 8.5 millions of species. We don’t know who counted or how it was done. “Computer statistics”. However, it is said that there are so many of them. None [other than human beings] have the necessary knowledge. Human beings are the only ones with that knowledge. They are the only ones with the ability to know this. Therefore, to facilitate learning of this knowledge, He taught it through various scriptures. They are called as sastra (authoritative scriptures). He states why and how He takes up what He does. He is not expecting any result. He is not expecting anything in return. We are not even expressing gratitude. Everyday, we are breathing in a lot of air, drinking a lot of water. We are eating everything that we can. “Oh prakruti (Nature)! Oh Bhagavan (God)! You bestowed the greatest benefit to me. I am so grateful to You.” Quite a few are living without even being able to think this way. As someone who can recognize what He has done… “I will mould physical, mental, intellectual acts such that, what He has done does not go in vain.” That’s all we must be doing out of gratitude, just through knowledge. If you can mould (an activity) this way, it becomes yajna (selfless action). Yajna (selfless action) does not mean bringing something new and putting on a coat. It does not mean putting on anything like a helmet. Or it does not mean taking something away [from what you do]. A nice bhavana (feeling, attitude). Oh Bhagavan (God), You are manifesting in so many forms around me and protecting me. Do it with love. We cannot get away from activities. We cannot get away from waking up in the morning, Eating something, sometimes before or sometimes after a bath. Drinking water, Going to places. Interacting with people around us. If life must be led with all of this, why cry about it? Lead the same with love. How simple it is. Lead it with love. What does love mean? It’s being grateful to what someone has done for your sake. Narayana is bestowing such great upakara (benefit) for me. Therefore, whatever I am doing is in His service. Think this way and do your work. How can everything become His service? He is somewhere else, isn’t it? He doesn’t sit elsewhere. In our Vedic sampradaya (tradition), knowledge passed on as a set of recommended Vedic practices… Bhagavan (God) is not said to be someone who sits in swarga (heaven), on a grand seat, holding a sceptre… Watching everyone go and come! He is filled in every anuvu (smallest particle). He watches every second. Therefore He exists in every object that you have and behind every activity you do. Realize this and do everything with love [for God]. A mother does not expect anything in return for what she is giving to her child. Anyone in love with someone does not expect any returning favor when they do something for them. If a man loves a woman, or vice-versa, anything they do for each other does not expect anything in return. They do so because they cannot be without doing things for them. Bhagavan (God) did the greatest favor by giving us life, that which no one can do and is impossible for anyone to do. He gave us a body, equipped with tools and strength to do all those works. He gave all those to function without contradictory complexity. He is enabling us to lead life so happily. If we don’t even feel that what we are doing is for Him, then what’s the purpose of living?\nvayam sumappadu vambu (it is wrong for such a person to be even born on the Earth)\nSuch a person should be eased out from here. If one does something for his/her dear friend, will he do so for recognition or praise? Even if he gets scolded, he would do it if it's beneficial for him [the friend]. Even if it’s a difficult thing for him, he would do it if it’s beneficial for the friend. We are witnessing this with a mother. Even if the child is in dirt, she will pick him up and cleanse him. She does not do so expecting any gratitude from the child. She does so out of love, unable to hold herself back from doing it because of the small relationship. He is caring for us from countless yugas (epochs), lakhs (hundreds of thousands) of years. Without stepping aside from us even for a second, He is protecting us. He is not stepping aside from anything around us even for a second and bestowing the greatest benefit. We need to just change our attitude towards whatever we do and do it as His service. This is what He said earlier in the 8th verse, yajnardhath (for the sake of yajna). If you don’t do this, won’t you be stealing the show as it belongs to someone else [God] and is for everyone? Things in this world are not for you alone. We think everything is for us. We behave as if the entire world is for us. We are not claiming all the land only because things are not working out in our favor. Otherwise.. Wherever possible, aren’t there many people always trying to claim a foot, 10 feet, 1 acre, 100 acres of neighboring land? It could be an ordinary person or countries up in the north! They are trying to claim a bit more and more everytime they see an opportunity. This is the way they are living. Nature is made for everyone’s purpose. Instead of thinking of the happiness of everyone and the God who pervades everything… If one thinks only about his happiness and experiences them… I don’t care what happens to the tree even if it is destroyed, I just want to have all its yield. If this is how one thinks, what do we call him?\nthair datthaha na pradayebhyaha yo bhunkte (He extracts from them but without caring, destroys them)\nsthena eva saha (he is a thief)\nHe becomes eligible for punishment. God clarifies this aspect in verse 12 of Chapter 3. Therefore, live the way you are living and do what you are doing happily. You don’t have to compromise on anything. You don’t need to give up on what you need. You don’t need to impose anything new. Just remember one thing. The underlying supporting tattva (principle) behind your consciousness is Narayana. Everything you get from the surroundings is a result of Narayana. Therefore, you do it for His happiness, not for your happiness or for anyone else’s praise. Do every work or let everything happen for Narayana’s happiness. Whatever is an appropriate thing, do it without any dilemma. That is when you will be loved by God. That is when you will be liberated from karma. That is when whatever you do can be called yajna (selfless action). Sri Krishna is thus clarifying the process of transforming nitya karma (daily activities) into yajna (selfless action). He tells it to Arjuna to motivate him for waging the war [that needs to be fought]. He is thus gracing us all [with the message].\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n`a:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m lo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham` (I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, grants all wealth, and delights the world.)\nBhagavad Gita is the greatest upade:sa (edification) from Sri Krishna to Arjuna. Arjuna was under the illusion that he should not be doing what was actually his duty. Also, he was feeling responsible for doing that which he was not supposed to be doing. Bhagavad Gita taught him the way he must perform his duties. Arjuna is supposed to be fighting in the war. He is in that situation then. However, he felt it is better to beg for alms. He felt that whatever they did during their exile for 12 years in forests is better [than fighting in the war]. Why unnecessarily kill all of them? How can we eat the food obtained as a result of all the bloodshed? Is he feeling pity for them? Or is he being lazy about his work? There was no clarity in the reasoning. He went into such a state.\nThis kind of state is not limited to Arjuna back then. Today, we also feel the same about our responsibilities. We wonder if it is necessary to do our duties. We feel it may be better to do something else instead. We are inclined to do what we are not supposed to be doing. We are inclined to either skip or delay that which we are supposed to be doing. A similar situation emerged for Arjuna. The technical term for one doing the right thing is called karma a:charana (performing actions). It is the technical term. If we use the word ‘work that we do’, it sounds easy. If we use the term karma, it feels Ve:da:nthic (philosophical). It sounds like a difficult thing. It feels like a heavy load on the head. However, let’s use the term. If we use it a few times, we will get used to it.\nKrishna’s teaching states that one must perform karma (actions). You said that the underlying jna:na (knowledge) is greater than karma (actions). Hence, my mind is set on that jna:na (knowledge). Therefore, I will skip karma (actions) and focus on jna:na (knowledge). This is Arjuna’s contention. [Interestingly,] everyone who argues about something has their own reasoning for the argument. During arguments in courts, if one wants to prove that something should be done… One quotes (incidents) from the past depicting why it should be done. The other one presents that which shows why the same should not be done. Yes, there are two sides to it. However, for the situation that is present at the moment, what is the right thing to do? That is what the judge needs to look at. Sri Krishna is currently the judge. Arjuna has his own set of prama:na (means for knowledge of something), supporting why he should stop doing the work. Krishna is instructing him to do the activity [karma (action)]. Arjuna is justifying that he must quit the activity because it is not a good thing to do. Dharma sa:sthras (scriptures on law and moral conduct) say:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarmana: badhyathe: janthuhu vidya ya:cha vimuchyathe:\nthasma:th karma na kurvanthi yathayaha pa:radarsinaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nA living being is bound by actions, and liberated by knowledge.\nTherefore, seers with true vision do not perform actions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThose with the right vision, good foresight and the worthy seers… `karma na kurvanthi` (They don’t do work.) Why? `karmana: badhyathe: janthuhu` (The work that a person does binds the person.) `vidya ya:cha vimuchyathe:` (Knowledge releases the person.) The great seer, Para:sara also said… `sa: vidya: ya: vimuchyathe:` (That is called vidya (knowledge), which liberates.) The same is also referred to as jna:na (knowledge), upa:sana (meditation), thapas (austerity). Therefore, I will just do thapas (austerity), meditate and reflect deeply. I will happily sit doing upa:sana (meditation in close vicinity to the target object). I will happily do vidya:bhy:sa (pursuance of knowledge). Why use these arrows? Why get hurt? Why shoot them and hit others? Why do I want the kingdom that is attained by someone being killed. Therefore, I will happily quit this and leave. This is the state in which he [Arjuna] was. He needs to be assured. He needs to be taught in an appealing manner that performing karma (actions) is a good thing. This is what Krishna is doing. He is focusing Chapter 3 on the same.\nIt is true that karma (actions) binds. However, karma (actions) is of different types. Nithya karma (daily activities), naimitthika karma (occasional obligatory duties), ka:mya karma (actions arising from desires), nishiddha karma (forbidden activities). There are various types of karmas (actions). Nithya karma (daily activities), one must not skip doing. Naimitthika karma (occasional obligatory duties), is also something that one must not skip doing. Ka:mya karma (actions arising out of our desires), is that which someone can skip if they don’t want. Let’s take eating as an example for nithya karma (daily activities) because we are used to that. It will be easier to understand. Having your meal is a nithya karma (daily activity). Depending on what your needs are, you should be eating. Whether it is rice, curries, roti or something else. Nithya karma (daily activities) cannot be avoided.\nNaimitthika karma (occasional obligatory duties). Sometimes, there are some occurrences like eclipses, e:ka:dasi (eleventh day of the lunar fortnight) or something else etc. For that day based on the occurrence, there are some designated karmas (actions). Perform them. Ka:mya karma (actions arising from desires). As part of the meal today, you felt like preparing gulab jamun (an Indian dessert). If possible, he will make it. Otherwise, he will sleep imagining how yummy it would be. If he was able to secure the ingredients, he would make it. Or if someone gave it to him, he would happily eat it. This is ka:myam (desire). He got the desire to do something. If he can get it, he will eat it. Otherwise, he will skip it. You can skip doing ka:mya karma (actions arising from desires) if you want to. Nithya karma (daily activities) and Naimitthika karma (occasional obligatory duties) cannot be skipped.\nThere are some karmas (actions) named nishiddha karmas (forbidden activities). These are some karma (actions) that you must not venture into. On the subject of eating… `nakalancham bhakshe:th na sura:m pibe:th` (don’t eat meat, don’t drink alcohol). People get angry if we say these things. It is relatively comfortable to refer to them as tha:masa food (food that promotes inertia/darkness). Tha:masa food (food that promotes inertia/darkness) should not be consumed. How do we know what that means? Therefore, don’t eat onion or meat. Because if an animal is killed. It’s called a dead body. Only if a moving body is killed, it’s called a dead body. Immediately one may wonder whether “killing” a living being like a tree is not a crime.. Can that be consumed? Such questions will arise. There are answers for that. We must know all of that in detail. We must seek [right people] for those answers. Something can be called dead only when life is gone from a moving body. It can be a mosquito, fly, human being, or an animal. When pra:na (life force) leaves a tree, it is not called a dead body. It is said to be dried up. We call it a stick. However, if a moving body loses the same, it is named as a dead body. Doesn’t matter if it is a hen, lamb, donkey, dog, horse or anything else. Let’s not name them. If pra:na (life force) is lost or taken away from a body that was once moving, it is called a dead body. The place where dead bodies are kept is called a graveyard. If you put those bodies in this body, it is called a graveyard too. Therefore, don’t turn yourself into a graveyard. It is the tha:masa food (food that promotes inertia/darkness) that changes you in such a way. So, take out tha:masa food (food that promotes inertia/darkness). Don’t eat those. Don’t eat tha:masa food (food that promotes inertia/darkness). It is nishiddha (forbidden). Because it is nishiddha (forbidden), it is nishiddha karma (forbidden action).\nSome leafy vegetables encourage rajo: and thamo: guna (dangerously active and highly inactive qualities respectively). There are no instruments that can discover rajo: and thamo: guna (active and inactive qualities) yet. Our science has not yet invented those. However, our scriptures have clarified those. They recommended keeping those types of foods away. Onion is an example that they cited. Bottle Gourd, radish are some examples. Actually, many nutritionists recommend these foods. That is right, but what are they good for? They are good for the body. Then, why not have them? A human being has both a body and a manas (mind). What is important? Body or mind? One person’s body is super strong, but his mind is not stable. What is he called? Something… His mind is not functioning. Such people are called by some names. Another’s mind is strong. His body might be diseased, or very thin, or may not have some organs yet his mind is efficient. Think about what is important now. Body or Mind? It’s not the body, it’s the mind. Body is necessary, but when it comes to what is the more important tool between the two, it is the mind. Take care of the body, without hampering the mind. Don’t build your body with that which is spoiling the mind. Use the body such that it doesn’t bring down the efficiency of the mind. That which nourishes the strength of mind is satthva guna (quality of goodness/purity). `satthva:th sanja:yathe: jna:nam` (From goodness, knowledge arises.) That’s what the saying is based on. Scriptures say, `a:ha:ra suddhow sattva suddhihi` (When food is pure, the mind becomes pure). Mind becomes efficient based on the food you eat. If your mind is good, you will attain knowledge in the right manner. Therefore, such food is named as sa:tthvika a:ha:ra (food that promotes goodness/purity). How are they formed and what are they? There is a process for that and you must follow accordingly. If we take such sa:tthvika food (food that promotes goodness/purity), satthva guna (quality of goodness/purity) rises in us. Rajo: and thamo: guna (active and inactive qualities) get suppressed.\nTherefore, what is nishiddha (prohibited) and what vihitha (recommended)? What is recommended and what is not recommended? Even in the karmas (actions) that you do, there are some that are nishiddhas (forbidden). Don’t do them. There are some that are vihitha karma (recommended actions). They are nithya (daily), naimittha (occasional), ka:mya (desire-driven). Whatever, whenever and however they are right for you, do them happily. Do whatever you can. Even if you cannot do all of them, keep doing what you can properly and carefully. Therefore, `karmana: badhyathe: janthuhu` (a living being is bound by actions) is said in the context of prohibited karmas (actions). For the nithya (daily), naimitthika (occasional) and ka:mya karmas (desire-driven actions), if you know why and how to do them… Then it is not `karmana: badhyathe:` (a binding action). `yathaya: pa:radarsinaha` (great seers) `na kurvanthi` (not doing them). They are leaving the prohibited karmas (actions). They are not leaving the recommended karmas (actions). To clarify this… Sri Krishna structured a complete chapter 3 and then separated the related aspects into chapters 4, 5 and 6. There was the need to use four chapters to explain this. We are learning it. Satiate the de:vathas (deities) through the work you do. `ishta:n bho:ga: hi vo: de:va:ha: da:syanthe: yajna bha:vitha:ha` (The gods, nourished by sacrifice, will give you the desired enjoyments.) If you can do the karma (action) with proper knowledge of it, then it becomes a yajna (sacrificial action). If you can do this, the Nature around you will be happy. Lord also will be happy. If you can receive that and lead your life, you will become a capable one. Otherwise, you will become a thief. Your life must always go on with what you get from yajna (sacrificial action). He clarifies this in verse 2.13.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyajna sishta:sinas santhaha\nmuchyanthe: sarvakilbishaihi |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose who eat the remnants of sacrifice are freed from all sins.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere Arjuna said, “karmana: badhyathe: …” (a living being is bound by actions). However Krishna says… What does He say? `muchyanthe: sarvakilbishaihi` (relieves from all kinds of sins). When? `yajna sishta asinaha` (whoever leads a life that is turned into yajna (sacrificial action)). `sath` (he alone becomes sath (one who has)). He becomes san. Sath (one who has) means one who has. Asath (one who doesn’t have) is one who doesn’t have. You should be one who has, not one who does not have. Therefore, yajna (sacrificial action) is a very important means for a human being’s life. It is a tool. It is a wonderful process to sanctify karma (actions). When that happens, that yajna (sacrificial action) can also be called karma yo:ga (the yoga of action). He moves forward explaining it from verse 13. Let’s gradually learn it.\n`Vande: guru parampara:m` (I bow to the lineage of teachers.)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 3,
    "episode": 31,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBhagavad Gita, chapter 3 is a chapter that properly reveals true Nature. Particularly, it is a chapter that clarifies what one should know in the month of Karthika. What does one do in Karthika month? Vana bhojana (forest feast), cook and eat in the shade of many trees. Dipa aradhana (lighting of lamps), light up lamps at homes and temples to brighten the entire place. Additionally, we gather at the tree-filled groves, offering worship to vana devatha (divine force in the form of trees). The five elements as water, trees, land, air and space are all worshiped as the forms of devathas (divine beings). People spend divine quality time with them during the entire day and then head back to their homes. We see this as a tradition observed for a long time in many places. This is named as Karthika vana bhojanas. In the evening, people light up lamps. It is an indication to show that they have light when it gets dark. Or, it shows that they will always worship the tejas or jyothis (divine energy of light), that can eliminate any emerging darkness.\nWhat should one do? We feel that trees are devathas. We feel that the rest of the elements are also devathas. The essence of this practice is to perceive devathas in every object in and the surrounding Nature. We must light up a lamp of that knowledge. We do it from Dipavali of course. We must light up all the lamps. A lamp giving the knowledge of ‘who I am’ should be lit. A lamp giving the knowledge of ‘who brought me here’ should be lit. A lamp giving the knowledge of ‘the relation between Him and us’ should be lit. A lamp giving the knowledge of ‘the goal that we must reach’ should be lit. A lamp that can eliminate the darkness from ‘the hurdles that block us from our goal’ should be lit. It does not harm to go another step forward. When you are living in a country, [a lamp of] interest and devotion towards the country [must be lit]. When you are born into a sanskrithi (culture) and sampradaya (set of Vedic traditions passed on from lineage), “I will protect the sampradaya. I will adhere to the sampradaya.” A lamp that fills the light enabling us to stand for it [sampradaya] must be lit. This way, if we can light the lamps that will remind us about the qualities that we must have, we can then assume that the expenses and our efforts [for lighting the lamps] will become purposeful. Otherwise, if all the effort involved and the wicks, oil used in lighting up a number of lamps is only for illuminating the place, we can simply use electrical bulbs to give brighter illumination. We can observe this. The goal of what we do in the month of Karthika is not limited to eliminating external darkness. There is also a jyothis (radiance) that must illuminate in us. It is related to many areas. Remember each area, light it up and radiate from within with the related knowledge. Light up a lamp for each of them. It’s fine to light as many such lamps as there are. Then they will become purposeful.\nThis is one part of it. The second part is about all the objects and creatures in Nature that are supporting our lives. That is why Srimad Bhagavatham reveals, firstly, everything that is worth and necessary for supporting the life of a human being were created. It was only after that did God bring in human beings to this world. What that means is that every prani (creature) cooperates with and supports the life of a human being. If something is cooperating with us, then it is a responsibility for us to offer proper help and protect it. Isn’t it? If air is cooperating with you, then it is our responsibility to take good care of it. If water is cooperating with you, then it is our responsibility to take proper care of it. If trees are cooperating with you, then it is our responsibility to make sure trees are able to grow well. If birds, animals, various types of insects, worms are cooperating with you, it is our responsibility to take good care of all of them. To take good care does not mean to nurture or pet them in our houses. It means to ensure their existence in their natural spaces is intact and they can live in their natural order. We must remember this when we speak of taking good care of them. That is why, our people must practice vana bhojanas. Spend some time in the spaces filled with trees and observe the environment there. To spend some time there, one should not spoil them by plucking leaves, branches. We should not mess up the area by plucking out flowers, fruits and scattering garbage of what we eat. It is about observing the truths of the environment and the surroundings. We can see nature where there is a small plant and a big tree. The small plant grows in its own manner. The same with the big tree. They don’t think of suppressing each other. The small plant does not yield to jealous or envious seeing the big tree. One does not fight for what is for the other. The big tree does not think of shaming the small plant that it is inferior or petty. Both grow in their own way and live together. We observe this in the trees.\nIf we take insects and worms, one takes another as its food. It’s not our responsibility to get rid of anything but to observe. There is a natural order that already exists in nature. If we go and put our hand in there, we will end up spoiling it and in turn destroy ourselves. We should observe. If there is anything we can learn from there, we should. We should be able to adopt it in our lives. If we take the forest areas, creatures like garden lizards feed on honey bees. We are not responsible for feeling pity and pushing away the lizards. Or, we are not responsible to drive away the bees because they suck nectar from the flowers. There are some channels like Discovery. Some have cameras observing and capturing what the animals are doing. One animal either feeds on another or nurtures. It does something. They never interfere in that process. They observe what is going on and share that with us. This is their responsibility. When we observe nature, it’s the same responsibility we have too. An animal such as a tiger or a lion eating up a smaller animal such as a rabbit or a wolf. We are not responsible for stopping them or doing something for the other. Be an observer. Observe. Understand what the prakruthi dharma (character of Nature) is. Observe their state. If you are intelligent, you will notice that it eats when hungry and does not bother touching anything else afterwards. If you can apply it in your life, do it. When we go to the forest, that is what we must do. Perhaps our people are observing vana bhojanas etc to learn any methods or morals from there. Hoping that, at least in the name of those events, people can spend some time there. They would be able to relish Nature or be able to observe what’s there. They would be able to at least stay away from materialistic things. Perhaps that is why these were organized. This is a method where we perceive and worship forest as the form of devathas.\nAdditionally, Upanishads named our senses also as devathas. Senses are made out of nature. They are part of nature. Therefore, senses are able to perceive things from nature. However, they are also named devathas. We will learn later about why they are named as devathas. God stated earlier in chapter 3 itself that you are created along with them [devathas].\nde:va:n bha:vayatha ane:na the: de:va: bha:vayanthu vaha parasparam bha:vayantha (Respect the devathas. They will look out for the state that you desire. He declared that the two live happily in unison giving and taking from each other.)\nLeading life while respecting the devathas, this way is a Yagam, a Yajna (sacrificial ritual). God is speaking of this [yajna] in the current scenario in chapter 3. He said that if one can lead a life like this, it is a very pious way. Why are senses referred to by the name of devathas? Devathas have certain abilities. They never sleep. They never stay on the ground. They are not visible to our eyes. However, they are around us and influence us. Whatever is surrounding us and has the name of devathas is of that nature. And the senses in us are also of the same type. None of them are visible to us. They are always working. They are never stable. That is probably why the Upanishads named our senses also as devathas. You are living along with them. So, respect their law. Behave according to them. They will offer you what you need. Ensuring the boundary of their law, order, and discipline, you can benefit from them. Let them also benefit from you. Stay happy together. This is what God is instructing us in chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita. This is in fact very essential for our life. To give us the knowledge of this, He demonstrated a wonderful cycle. After demonstrating the cycle, He says,\ne:vam pravarthitham chakram (everyone must abide by the cycle)\nIn Karthika month, learn about that cycle, respect Nature and devathas. Show the interest and concern you have for them. They should be doing well and we should also do well. With the knowledge of all of that, light up a nice lamp. Doing so, let us move ahead in learning Gita.\nJai Srimannarayana! Vande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)."

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita, chapter 3 bestows knowledge such that the significance of Karthika (a Hindu calendar month) is clarified. And takes us further along.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all misfortunes, bestows all prosperity, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAs part of giving the upadesa (instruction) to Arjuna in verse 3.12, [He says]... I have sent you [human beings] to the world along with some devathas (divine beings), life supporting beings. Both, you and they should collaborate happily making use of each of your abilities. Remember one thing. Devathas (divine beings) will always give whatever is suitable for you and whatever you desire. However, you should also do what is necessary for them. Only then, will there be well-being. Instead… If you are receiving what they give but not doing what you are supposed to be doing for them… That will become stealing.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthair daththa: na prada:yaibhyo:\nyo: bhunkthe:s the:na e:va saha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe who enjoys what is given by them without offering it back to them is indeed a thief.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe elaborates it in verse 3.12. In fact, Nature gives us everything we need. It never deprives us of anything. Rain, clouds, water, land, dairy, crops. It gives all of these. Are we using the water properly? Are we doing what we should be doing with respect to it? Land is offering us a great help, giving us a place to stay. Are we keeping it sacred the way we should? Air is giving us life energy. Are we keeping it as sacred as we should be keeping it? This is something we should reflect on. In fact, though we pollute water to the worst extent, Nature by itself cleans it and gives it back. We are witnessing this everywhere in nature. No matter how many ways we insult nature, it does not mind. It keeps giving us the benefits and helping us. However, if we stop doing what we should be, isn’t it going to hurt our own existence in the end? Don’t work towards that dear! This is what Sri Krishna is instructing in verse 3.12. If you are anyway receiving what you should be from them, shouldn’t you be giving what you should to them?\nThere are some stalls selling fruit. People go to check them out. Some people steal the fruit, dropping them into their bag while the seller turns around or away. The seller is getting fruits from somewhere else, and trying to sell them to make a living. If possible, you should serve or help him but not attempt to steal what he has. Nature is offering us many kinds of benefits. You are accepting the divine energies from it. You don’t have to give it anything new. You must at least ensure its natural state is not at stake. This is what we should be doing. God named the leading of this kind of life as yajna (worship/sacrificial action). An indigenous saying in Sanskrit goes as… yaja deva pujayayam (worship of the divine). Yaga (ritual sacrifice) and yajna (worship/sacrificial action) are used as synonyms. Deva puja (worship of the divine). It is to worship devathas (divine beings) with sraddha (reverential faith). We think of worship as… Vayu (Air) is a devatha (divine being). Make it as a deity, offer flowers, turmeric, kunkum (vermillion powder), camphor etc. Offer it a banana. Offer namaskara (respects). We think worship is over. Varuna (Water deity) is another devatha (divine being). Place a lamp, and offer incense stick fragrance. We think we are done with it. There are all these with the name of devatha (divine being) around us. We think worshiping them is to create a form for it and offer respect to it as a formality. We forgot that it is a way of daily life. Sri Krishna is reminding us of this in chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita. Your life itself must be led as an act of worship to them.\nEvery creature, object, thatthva (principle/reality) is working 24/7 everyday for the sake of others' benefit. Human beings must learn to lead life that way. They are assuming that it is their right to take what they [devathas (divine beings)] give but forgetting their responsibility for them. You can see many people fighting for human rights, or some other rights. People fight for rights but forget responsibilities. It is great to fight for rights but it also comes with a responsibility. We should fight for rights after realizing and fulfilling our responsibility. These days, what we are left with is fighting for rights and the responsibilities are put aside. Human beings are thinking this way about nature. They think it is their right to exploit nature. Okay, it’s your right. However, there is also a responsibility. Responsibility comes before rights. After fulfilling the responsibility, fighting for rights comes into picture if they are not given. Despite being abused by us, Nature is giving us the necessary nourishment even without having to fight for it. We must remember this important aspect. God says they [devathas (divine beings), divine energies supporting your existence] will always give you… ishtan bhogan hi vo devaha dasyante (the divine beings will indeed give you the desired enjoyments). They will never go back on giving you. However, remember one thing. yajna bhavitaha (nourished by sacrifice/worship). When you believe them to be devathas (divine beings) and lead life with worshipful feeling towards them, They will offer you [what you need] with much more love. Take it. You should also reciprocate with a reverential feeling for them. Make it a part of your life rather than spending five minutes prayer time towards them as if it's just a duty.\nSomeone is writing something on a book and you simply snatch it from him because you need it. How does that look? We can imagine. That’s not how it should be. We must approach him and ask if he could lend it to you for a minute and that you will give it back. He will then give it to you with love. With love, he may ask you to even keep it knowing you don’t have it. When? Only if you respectfully seek it from him. You don’t even ask and simply snatch it for your purpose and go on with it. Without even having a sense that it belongs to him… This is something monkeys do. You are sitting somewhere with some fruit. A monkey shows its teeth and nails, simply takes away some fruits, and begins eating. It doesn’t even say thanks because it took your fruit. Forget about asking, it doesn't even show gratitude. It keeps eating by itself. We are not monkeys. We are human beings. You may say we have come from monkeys. That’s not right. God clarifies this properly in Chapter 3. Devathas (divine beings), human beings, thiryak (horizontally moving beings - animals) and stthavaras (stationary beings - plants). All of them are created at the same time. I did not create one from another.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nparasparam bha:vayanthaha\nsre:yah param ava:psyattha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBy nourishing each other, you will attain the highest good.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf we are seeking something, it should be sought with respect and with acceptance of the giver. That way of seeking is the best way. The great seers have taken this to the extent that… Before stepping on the floor, [they express the following]. Oh mother Earth! You are bearing everyone. I am having to step on you. padasparsham kshamavasva me (please forgive my touch). Pardon my arrogant act. I don’t know how to walk without doing so. I am therefore having to walk like this. Pardon this audacity. When using water, [they express the following]. Oh Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Saraswati, Narmada, Sindhu, Kaveri (names of sacred rivers)… All of you with the divine ability vested in you, please sanctify me and mold me to being useful in serving God. We are saying this prayer and then using them. To cut a flower, or a fruit from a tree, pray and then do it. Even cutting a leaf. Our people habituated us with such a great samskara (refined practice/culture). Feeling overly smart about being “educated”, we are destroying the existing samskaras (refined practices/cultures). We think all of these are all nonconscious. They also have a consciousness. They do not portray it in the manner that we can notice or know about. They have their own order. Are we not seeing it in the animals, in the human beings? Everything has its own order. We have an order. It has a different order. Our order follows talking, expressing through eyes, working through hands etc. We don’t know what their order is. In nature, the untimely rains and [disturbances in] seasons are a result of us breaching our order. In people, that is the reason for their extreme behaviors. It is important to observe these. We can take anything from nature, but we should pray to them and be grateful to them. If we can observe this, it will be satisfied and we will be satisfied. It will cooperate with us. We notice this with animals. Pet an animal like a horse, cow, dog, cat, goat or any animal properly. We can see that it will act in accordance with our wish. This is consciousness that is portrayed as a response in the areas that we are able to notice. This will be the case with everything in nature. God wants us to observe this. It is burglary if we take in things without this [understanding]. Leading life in this manner is a type of Yajna (worship/sacrificial action). Therefore, know that they are all the forms of devathas (divine beings). Live with them properly. Live in unison with each other. Everyone be happy. Get the good benefits. This is a wonderful upadesa (instruction) from God in chapter 3. Let’s move ahead learning about it. Vande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)."

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBhagavad Gita, chapter 3 is describing yajnas (sacrifices). Generally, when we think of Yajna, we think of a scholar or priest and a ho:ma kunda (fire-altar), shaped in a square, circle, etc. We think of dharbha (sacred grass material), ghee, firesticks, sesame seed substances called sa:kalyam. A pavithra (sanctified thread) tied on the wrist, mantras, a:huthi (oblations), offering ghee and chanting mantras, etc. This is what we imagine. This is also called a Yajna.\nBhagavad Gita chapter 3 says that yajna does not mean just that. This is only one type of yajna amongst many yajnas we conduct. In fact, human life itself is a yajna. One’s emotion should be filled with the sense of yajna. Every moment must be led with the residue of yajna. This is a wonderful upade:sa (instruction).\nBhagavad Gita, chapter 3, verse 13:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyajna sishta:sinaha santhaha muchyanthe: sarvakilbishaihi |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose who eat the remains of Yajna become pure and are freed from all sins.\n-----------------------------------------------\nGod clearly says, yajna sishta asinaha santhaha bhavanthi (those who eat the remains of Yajna become pure). Santhaha (pure ones). San (one who exists). We must become those who are ‘beings’. When do we become? If what needs to be done because of our existence is done, then we become ‘beings’. We employ a gatekeeper. If he is doing the work of the gatekeeper, then it means he is there. He says he is there from a specific time in the morning till a specific time in the evening, but if the work that needs to be done by him is not done, then what’s the purpose of him being there? It’s of no use. One can be said to be existing when he is doing what he is supposed to be doing. When someone says there is fire, we acknowledge it when it is giving heat. We say something is there when what is supposed to be happening because of its existence, is happening. We turn on the fan. The blades move. However, we do not feel the breeze. Do we say there is a fan there? Does it mean it’s working? All the money put in and the electricity charges for it are a waste. Not useful for anything.\nSimilarly, when does a human being become one who exists? When does he become sath (that which exists)? Sath (that which exists). Someone can be said to be existent only when he takes the remains of the yajna. If a creature or a being can live with the remains from the yajna, then it can be termed as existing. We don’t need to say the same for an animal. In fact, in chapter 3, God began with this: saha yajnaihi praja:ha srustva: (having created beings along with Yajna). Praja:ha (all that takes birth). All that is prakarshe:na ja:yathe: (becomes praja). All the insects, worms, animals, birds come under praja: (beings). However, God is not giving upade:sa (instruction) for all the creatures. He is doing so for human beings. Why? Because he is the only [species] that can realize it and has the qualification for it. Only one who has the qualification for it is given the chance to realize it. One will take efforts in making someone realize it only if he has the qualification for it. There is no question of this for other creatures. Because all the others follow the same order in which they were born. Only human beings are incapable of following [the order]. That is why, He is teaching only human beings.\nsaha yajnaihi praja:ha srustva: (having created beings along with Yajna). Although it is referring to all the creatures, keep others aside and apply it for human beings in this context. God created all the human beings along with yajna. Therefore what is he supposed to be doing? He should become yajna sishta asi (one who lives on the remains of Yajna). That is, he should be leading life as a yajna. When doing so, all that he gets becomes yajna se:sha (remains of yajna). Also, that should become the means by which he leads life. Asi (eating through the mouth). We know the meaning of asi to be eating through the mouth. What is eaten is called asanamu (what is eaten). Whoever eats it is called asi (eater). We refer to those substances that give taste to the tongue as asi (food for the tongue). However, there are other indriyas (sense organs). Eyes also ‘eat’. Ears also ‘eat’. Nose also ‘eats’. Skin also ‘eats’. Whatever a sense organ is experiencing, that becomes the ‘food’ for that specific sense organ. Therefore, all these [food] should be that which are obtained only from performing yajna. Then, he becomes yajna sishta asi (one who lives on the remains of Yajna). He becomes one who exists. If not, he becomes only an expense and burden to the earth but not one to be recognized.\nyajna sishta asinaha santhaha (those who eat the remains of Yajna become pure). Whoever receives only that which is obtained from performing yajna, only he becomes san (one who exists). San (one who can be termed as existing). What happens to him? Firstly, his manas (mind) will be nirmala (clean and clear). muchyanthe: sarvakilbishaihi (he will be free from all faults). He will be free from all the do:shas (faults). Do:shas (faults) are of two types. One type are those that [lead him through respective karma] relieving him from all the bonds. After he is relieved from the bonds and after he realizes the nature of self, then there are those that give him the experiences he should have. There are two types of phalithas (results). The required means for them are also in the same manner. That which is to be attained as the end goal is called pra:pthi (attainment). All that is done for it are called upa:yas (means). There are do:shas (faults) that block pra:pthi (attainment). The yajna sishta asi (one who leads life as yajna) is not qualified to rid himself from those do:shas (faults). However, as part of the preface, there are some do:shas (faults) blocking one’s intellect needed for practicing means for it. He [yajna sishta asi] can rid himself from these do:shas (faults).\nLiberating a soul from karma bandha (bondage of actions) or edifying one on realizing his nature or later gracing him with the bliss of mo:ksha (liberation), only God can do these. Nothing else can do these. However, one needs knowledge of what it is that he should attain. One needs knowledge that he is eligible to attain [that goal]. As long as he is in this world, whatever sins or hurdles that block him from doing good deeds, he will be able to get rid of all those by taking in only the remains of life led as yajna. God clarified this part here. After one is cleared from these [do:shas] and then if one can lead life filled with devotion to Lord, He will then grace one with what he needs. None of these are a means to attain bhagavath pra:pthi (God realization). No means are useful for attaining bhagavath pra:pthi (God realization). It is only God’s grace that is the means for bhagavath pra:pthi (God realization). Nothing else. So, there are no means that can give Him [to us]. Karma (action) doesn’t give Him [to us]. Jn:ana (knowledge) doesn’t give Him [to us]. Bhakthi (devotion) doesn’t give Him [to us].\nna:ham ve:daihi na thapasa: na da:ne:na nacha ijyaya: sakyaha (I am not One who can be attained by Vedas, austerities, charity, or sacrifices). I am not One who can be attained with anything else other than My Will. A little ahead in Bhagavad Gita itself, God says that it is only His grace through which one can attain Him. However [the knowledge of]... This is what God is like. I need to behave as per His instructions. I need to be able to respect the nature that surrounds me. I need to be able to properly protect it. I need to be able to align myself accordingly. One needs to have knowledge of all this. He needs to be able to take a resolve in this manner. He needs to be able to behave accordingly. There are va:sanas (tendencies) from the past that prohibit him from behaving so. Instinctively, one might pluck a sampling out or poke someone or pluck out something. These are behaviors in us that result unconsciously. It is necessary to regulate these too. If one leads life as yajna, it will eliminate all those [va:sanas] that take control of us without our efforts. Eliminating that, it will enable one to enter the path of God. There is something such as karma yo:ga (path of action) that he needs to do, it will prepare him to do that. This is what God says here.\nYajna sishta (remains of Yajna). Perform yajna. Yajna does not mean [in this context] a ho:ma altar (fire-altar), and offering ghee in it. Everything you do is yajna. All things surrounding you are de:vathas (life supporting divine energies). Air, earth, trees, etc. are all de:vathas (divine energies). Live with this bha:vana (feeling). All these are given by God for me. I should also behave properly with them. Live with this principle. When you live this way, there will also be certain earnings for you. If you are plowing land, you will have something in hand. Eat it. Eat it with the de:vatha: bha:vana (believing them as God-sent divine powers supporting your life).\nmuchyanthe: sarvakilbhishaihi (he will be free from all faults). Then, the previous stock of karma (actions) will gradually leave one. sarvakilbhishaihi muchyanthe: (he will be freed from all faults). Manas (the mind) will become clean. What happens when the mind is clean? jna:namuthpadyathe: pumsa:m kshya:th pa:pasya karmanaha (knowledge arises in a person when sins are destroyed). There is no blocker because pa:pas (the result of bad work) are cleared. Therefore, the jna:na (knowledge) that has so far been suppressed in the mind will begin to shine. Like a [clean] mirror that shows our face properly, we can see clearly. yattha: darsa thala prakhye: pasya:th a:thma:na:m a:thmana: (just as one sees oneself in a clean mirror). If a mirror is dusted, one gets an opportunity to see oneself properly. Similarly, when kilbhishas (faults) from the mind and senses are cleared, one will develop knowledge of one’s duty, who he is, the qualities of surrounding nature, etc. Then, he can lead life happily.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbhunjathe: the: thvagham pa:pa:ha\nye: pachanthy a:thmaka:rana:th ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose who cook only for themselves eat only sin.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhoever does not live in this manner, he is a sinner. Whoever thinks everything is for his sake and that trees, animals, birds, people are all for his own sake. “It’s always about I, for me alone.” If one lives in this manner, that is a life which adds to the stock of pa:pa (sin). Through every penny that such person earns, every particle that he eats, he is agham bhunjathe: (accruing sin), darkening the already existing black paste, [i.e. making it worse]. ye: pachanthy a:thmaka:rana:th (those who cook only for themselves). One who minds only the body and lives with the goal of nurturing it alone, he is a great sinner. ke:vala:gho bhavathi (he accrues only sin). ke:vala:di: (he accrues only sin). He is accruing only pa:pa (sin). aghaha bhavathi (what he is doing is only a sin). What he is doing is only a sin. He is a sinner. In verse 3.13, Sri Krishna is emphasizing on this to tell us not to become that way [accrue sins]. This is showing us a wonderful cycle of life and taking us ahead. Gradually, let’s learn and move forward.\nVande: guru parapampara:m (I bow to the lineage of teachers).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m lo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham (I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nThere are several types of thefts in the world. Stealing something 'small' results in 'lesser' punishment. Stealing something 'big' results in 'bigger' punishment. Stealing something from a 'small' person. Stealing something from a 'big' person. If one steals from common people, it’s not a big deal for others. No one cares much for the victim. If one steals something from a popular person, it becomes breaking news. It gains popularity. Even if one steals big things from a normal person, people don’t care. A normal person owned a lot of land. If one illegally occupies it, it does not matter how much he pleads, it’s not cared for. However, if even a rupee note is lost from the pocket of a popular person, or even if someone steals a pen from him, it’s published on the frontline on newspaper and TV. This is something we all know.\nIt’s the same in one’s life too. In a human’s life too, it is a sin to steal things. It’s a worse sin to steal from a bigger person. Let’s observe the entire nature once.\nGod gave this upade:sa (teaching) in chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita. Whoever gave birth to everything that exists in the world is only One. He is the ‘big’ one. He is praja:pathi (the owner of everything and everyone), the owner of everything and everyone. His creation has all that exists. They all belong to Him. Whom? They belong to parama:thma (Supreme Soul), Lord Narayana. There are de:vathas (beings with divine powers), manushya (human beings), thiryak (horizontally moving beings / animals), sttha:vara (stationary beings / plants). These four types are all created by Him. He is the owner. All of them belong to Him.\nWhat are these beings doing? One of them is human being, and another is de:vatha (celestial being). The others are thiryak (animals) and sttha:vara (plants). All of these are His belongings. If you want to use one of these, whose permission do you need? You need the permission of one who is the owner. If He is the owner, shouldn’t we be taking His permission? However, interdependency is necessary here. It is so inevitable. Either through cooperation or some other way, one takes from another. Our people call it exploitation. Of course, exploitation is inevitable but over-exploitation is sinful and is dangerous. In the world, trees take from land, air, and water. Animals take a smaller animal as its food. One worm takes another for its food. This is a kind of exploitation but that is the cycle. It is natural. There is a process established for human beings too. Human beings exploit de:vatha (celestial beings), thiryak (animals) and sttha:vara (plants), all three of them. He is over-exploiting. This is the problem. Bhagavad Gita, chapter 3 instructs us to control that. How do we do that? Whatever you need from the creatures, ask and take from them. However much you need, take that much. Don’t take beyond needs. He explains it with de:vathas (celestial beings).\nIf he cuts [wood] from a fallen tree, it’s okay. If he takes sand from the neighbor’s land who is not around, perhaps ok. However, when he started exploiting the de:vathas (celestial beings) who support life, it became necessary to instruct him. Neither letting them know nor letting God know, human beings are stealing from them. In chapter 3, Sri Krishna brought the topic for this reason. Arjuna is also doing the same. Arjuna has strength, knowledge. God is right there and is instructing him about duties. All his brothers are following the instructions. They are abiding by His orders. Instead of abiding by that, he is contradicting it. The responsibility that he had come to fulfill, he is now wanting to leave it. “It is my right to quit fulfilling the responsibility.” This is what Arjuna is doing.\nvisrujya sasaram cha:pam (He dropped the bow and arrow from his hands.)\nThis is the first thing he did. He is forgetting his responsibility. What is the next thing he did?\nsre:yo: bho:kthum bhaiksham (It’s my right to beg for alms.)\nHence, I was about to set out for that. This is something bad. He is fighting for rights, forgetting his responsibility. He did not stop at that. Even if he did that, wouldn’t he be living with the same de:vathas (celestial beings) / praktruthi (nature)? What does it mean? Nature has given you abilities. You are misusing them. Nature cannot give them on its own. There is parama:thma (the Supreme Soul), God, in nature. Whatever we are referring to as de:vathas (celestial beings) such as agni (fire god), indra (king of gods), varuna (water god), va:yu (wind god), kube:ra (god of wealth), i:sa:na (a form of Shiva / controller) etc. They are all named.\nLet us look at it carefully from one angle. Every power in this which is able to operate [something] as Indra. Every te:ja (energy) in this as Agni. Think of anything that brings change as Yama (god of death). Think of everything that controls the boundaries of our behavior as Nirurithi (goddess of dissolution / controller of boundaries). Think of that which satiates thirst as Varuna. Let’s name whatever giving you pra:na (life force) as Va:yu. Let’s refer to that enriching wealth as Kube:ra. Let’s name that which controls something as I:sa:na. All these are de:vathas (celestial beings). All these are in fact not independent. It is Lord again who indwells in them as antharya:mi (one that controls from within / inner controller). Therefore, realize that they are indwelled by parama:thma (Supreme Soul), Lord and conduct yourself accordingly.\nHowever, we know what many people do nowadays. Even while seeing them as forms, deities, de:vathas (celestial beings)… People worship them as if they are independent and the cause of the world. This is wrong. Chapter 3 clarifies it. Chapter 7 also clarifies it further. Chapter 11 gets us to clearly witness the same. You can perceive any de:vatha (celestial being) because you are living with them. You can respect any de:vatha (celestial being). However, how do you respect it? Realize that parama:thma (Supreme Soul) indwells the de:vatha (celestial being) as antharya:mi (inner controller) and worship it. Don’t think of them as independent. Love your hand but realize that you are the reason for its functioning ability. Otherwise, it won’t. Same with the other hand too. Both hands are different from each other. Fingers are different from each other. Yet, I am the one within them enabling them to function. It is a thatthvam (reality / principle). We know this. Without the knowledge of this finger, if the other finger does not cooperate with the other, without the knowledge of this finger, if the other finger fights or troubles the other, it becomes our responsibility to control it.\nBali Chakravarthi (powerful emperor), is a very great being. People meditate upon him in this Ka:rthi:ka month (a Hindu calendar month). He is a great being, highly knowledgeable. Because he is highly knowledgeable, God Himself had to go to his yajna va:tika (place of yajna / sacrificial ritual) as a beggar. He was performing yajna (sacrificial ritual). We know the story. Bali Chakravarthi was performing yajna (sacrificial ritual). God went to the place of yajna (sacrificial ritual) as a Va:mana (dwarf incarnation of Vishnu) to ask for three feet of land. He asked, and the other gave. He measured but as a Thrivikrama (Vishnu's form covering three worlds). The history that was supposed to happen happened. There is something else we must observe here. He is performing yajna (sacrificial ritual). What is yajna (sacrificial ritual)? There is de:vatha: a:va:hana (inviting and worshiping de:vathas / celestial beings) like Indra, Agni, Varuna, Va:yu etc. However, he conquered all their kingdoms by fighting and beating them up. We know this. Isn’t it? He suppressed and conquered Indra and the others. While performing yajna (sacrificial ritual), there is dwa:ra tho:rana pu:ja (worship of gate decorations) where they all need to be worshipped. Then, how is he worshipping them? He invited Indra on the east side. He worshipped him. He did not see Indra as Indra, but he did it realizing Lord Narayana as the indwelling controller for Indra. He realized Lord Narayana as the antharya:mi (inner controller) of Agni and thus worshiped Agni. He realized Lord Narayana as the antharya:mi (inner controller) of Varuna and thus worshiped Varuna. He performed [yajna] with the realization that every a:huthi (offering), to every de:vatha (celestial being)… reaches Narayana as He is the antharya:mi (inner controller) of everyone. That is why, the yajna (sacrificial ritual) performed by Bali Chakravarthi is the perfect one. He performed it in Ka:rthi:ka month (a Hindu calendar month). God was happy seeing this. Therefore He Himself, walked to the place of yajna (sacrificial ritual) directly. As Va:mana (dwarf incarnation of Vishnu), He asked for three feet of land. He also granted him the supreme state that he wanted. This is what we must observe.\nLife must be led as yajnas (sacrificial rituals). However, do it with the realization that God is indwelling in everything as antharya:mi (inner controller). Do it with the realization that everything you do therefore translates into worshipping God. That is when it becomes Yajna (sacrificial ritual). That is when it becomes de:va a:ra:dhana (worshipping de:vathas / celestial beings). Therefore, all of these belong to God. If you take them without telling Him, what is it that you are doing? You are stealing not from common people, but stealing from the most supreme being, God. You are the biggest thief, despite it being a small or big object. Amongst all the objects/entities, the biggest and the most valuable one is soul. No one can put a price on soul. Only if the soul is in the body, there is value to the body and to whatever is done with the body. Therefore, the most valuable thing compared to the body or anything else is the soul. The soul also belongs to God. However, you are not behaving with the knowledge that it belongs to God. You are behaving as if it’s independent. You are thus stealing the soul. You are also stealing other things that belong to Him. This is the highest of the thefts amongst all. It is named a:thma:paha:ra (stealing the soul). This is wrong. That is why, He referred to him (such a one) as a big thief.\nsthe:na e:va saha yo: bhunkthe: (One who does not realize things belong to God and that he is a da:sa (obedient servant) to God, if he thinks he is living by himself earning something, he is a big thief.)\nThe ‘food’ such people ‘eat’...\nbhunjathe: the: thu agham (No matter how many such people exist, or whoever they are, they are all eating agham (sins).)\nagham pa:paha (They are living as sinners.)\nThey are living a life filled with sins. Everything they ‘eating’ is sinful. Their entire life will be full of sins. We should know this. If we know this and live accordingly, manas (mind) will become clean and clear. The impurities from manas (mind) will clear with the ‘food’ we ‘eat’ when living life filled with worshipping God. Ignorance will be wiped out. Ego and the rest will be wiped out. They all left Bali Chakravarthi. That is what God asked him. Dear, whatever you thought of as yours both in this world and the rest, give them to Me. Dear, whatever you are thinking as I, give it to Me as well. Clean your mind. Bali Chakravarthi was able to do this. He did not listen to anyone. He got lucky. God gave him a wonderful place called rasa: thala (a lower planetary system / a wonderful place). God Himself, is serving him as a gatekeeper. What a great thing it is! What does this mean? God obeys those who lead life as yajna (sacrificial ritual). Like a gatekeeper, He protects them. Making them highly qualified, He takes care of them. This is what the story of Bali Chakravarthi tells us. He (God) advises everyone to be that way and that He would serve everyone. He is not ashamed of it. He does not think of it to be belittling Him. Wouldn’t parents be happy serving their kids if they are growing in order? God also is happy if we live in an orderly manner. In chapter 3, God is instructing one to live this way and moving from verse 13 to the wheel of life. Let us also move ahead.\nJai Srimannarayana!\nvande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of gurus.)"

We should become free from do:shas (faults). In Bhagavad Gita, chapter 3, God enlightened us on what we should do to be that way. He instructed two tasks. The first one is to behave with surrounding objects, animate or inanimate, realizing that they have God within. The second one is, while leading life respecting them, we should receive the results of our efforts by a process of offering them to God in the form of ‘food’. Two tasks.\nWhat happens because of them? Your life will prosper. One is that you will build respect for everything around you. You will not encounter any extreme effects from them. Secondly, because you are receiving everything with bhagavad bha:vana (as an offering to God), you will not experience any extreme emotions. Life will be peaceful. You will lead a life full of love. You will be at peace, and everyone around you also will be at peace. This is the summary in brief.\nFirstly, the manas (mind) will become clean. A great seer shows what it is like when one’s mind is clean. Maha:nubha:va (the highly experienced one), Valmiki. In fact, Ramayana took birth because of such maha:nubha:va (great soul). A beautiful verse reveals the situation that turned him into such a wise one who can present Ramayana. A shooter shoots a bird. It falls and dies. Its partner bird goes around it weeping. Watching this, Valmiki’s heart melts. It begins ‘flowing’ out. The pouring tears result in a slo:ka (verse of a poem). That becomes a beautiful beginning for Ra:ma:yana upade:sa (introduction to Ramayana) for him. Later, he gifts [the world] with a clean mirror reflecting the history of mankind through an epic of 24,000 verses. We know that it is called Ramayana. Such maha:nubha:va (great soul) described that state of mind.\nThe great sage [Valmiki] reached the waterbanks to take bath along with his young disciple Bharadwaja. The disciple was carrying the necessary things in a basket and was walking behind him. The sage was walking ahead of him, on the banks of river Thamasa. He had some time before having a bath. He was walking back and forth. He looked at the flowing waters. As soon as he saw it, he expressed how nice the water was. In fact, the water was always that way. It was just that his mind was in the state of recognizing the beauty of water. How was it?\nakardamam idam thi:rttham (This sacred water has no mud)\nakardamam (there is no mud)\nIt is very clear and flowing. There is water on the surface, stones at the bottom. It is so clear that even a needle would be visible. Water was flowing with such clarity.\nidam thi:rttham (this sacred water)\nHe was showing the water. How is it?\nramani:yam prasanna:mbu (It is very pleasant to look at. Water is all very placidly clear. There is no mud to be seen anywhere.)\nDescribing it, the maha:nubha:va (great soul) says…\nsan manushya mano: yattha: (Like the manas (mind) of an utthama (greater) human being…)\nWith no ego, pride, arrogance, selfishness etc. but only filled with a flow of love always. Oh dear, the water in the river Thamasa is so beautiful. The water was always beautiful. That day He said so because his mind had reached such a state. All the kilbhishas (faults) that were with his mind have left it. He also became sath (truthful). He could become san manushya (a good human being). He was able to become santha (a peaceful person).\nWhen does one become that way? He explained this in chapter 3, verse 13.\nyajna sishta santhaha asinaha (Whoever leads life receiving only that which is obtained when living a lifetime as worship to God)\nHe becomes santhu (peaceful). Valmiki bhagavan (Lord Valmiki) is in that state. His heart is in such a clean state, a pure state. What do we do for that? We should understand the way of life. What is the way of life? What should be the way to realize it?\nIn chapter 3, Sri Krishna shows us a beautiful ‘wheel’. Knowing this wheel is very critical. Many have given expositions for Bhagavad Gita. They have given in the past. Even today, there are some who are writing it. Whoever thinks (himself) as even a little educated, is writing an exposition on Bhagavad Gita. However, the question is how many have actually understood the truths? The answer we receive is… rare. Ramanujacharya is the mahani:ya (great soul) who walked in the path of a lineage of acharyas… who knew Sri Krishna’s heart. So, they were able to understand the ‘wheel’ given by Swami (Lord) properly. He showed us its nature. We should observe how that is.\nBeginning with verse 3.14, God shows us a wonderful ‘wheel’. The wheel of life. What is it? God is bringing up a few things. This is coming from here. That is coming from there. This is resulting because of this. That is the result coming out of this. This must flow as a wheel. What does a wheel mean? It should start from here, go from one point to another and come back to the same spot again. It should go around and come back here. It should continue to move but does not end anywhere. It should not end and go up somewhere. It should not come all the way here and go that way, right? Let’s observe what He is saying here.\nanna:th bha:vanthi bhu:tha:ni (all the bhu:thas (beings) are living because of food)\nVerse 14\nanna:th bha:vanthi bhu:tha:ni (all the beings are taking shape because of food)\nLet us learn about the terms later. Let’s first look at what the terms are.\nanna:th bha:vanthi bhu:tha:ni (all the beings are taking shape because of food)\nparjanya:th anna sambhvaha (food is produced from rain)\nHe [Lord] is not taking us forward [on the wheel]. He is taking us backward. Let us take somewhere in the middle.\nanna:th bha:vanthi bhu:tha:ni (food is giving rise to all the beings)\nAll the beings take shape from food. He is going backward telling where the food came from.\nparjanya:th anna sambhvaha (All beings are living because of the food grown by the water of the rains from the clouds.)\nHe has come backward. He will probably go backward from here. How are these clouds formed?\nyajna:th bha:vathi parjanyo: (clouds are formed because of yajnas)\nWill clouds form because of yajnas? Yes, He says. What type of yajna? What kind of clouds will it form? How do they become the base for crops? Because of that consumed food, the five elements build up/grow. This is what we must observe.\nyajna:th bha:vathi parjanyo: (clouds form because of yajna)\nHow does a yajna get a form?\nyajnah karma samudbhavaha (Yajna results because of karma)\nWhat is karma? Whatever we do. Everything we do is named karma. How does karma get a form?\nkarma brahmo:dbhavam viddhi (Karma is caused because of Brahma)\nThere is some sort of confusion here. Let’s resolve that confusion later.\nkarma brahmo:dbhavam viddhi (Karma is caused because of Brahma)\nbrahma:kshara samudbhavam (Brahma is formed because of Akshara)\nWe need to know what Brahma and Akshara mean. That’s all, it’s over.\nthasma:th sarvagatham bramha (therefore, the Brahma that exists everywhere)\nnithyam yajne: prathishttitham (it [Brahma] should stay stable with yajna alone)\nHe said that it should be full of yajna. What is that? He brought it to Brahma and Akshara. He did not say what causes Akshara.\nnithyam yajne: prathishttitham (it should stay stable with yajna alone)\nHere are the complete verses that describe this wheel of life:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nannād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ |\nyajñād bhavati parjanyo yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFrom food, all beings are born. From rain, food is produced. From yajna (sacrifice), rain comes. Yajna is born from karma (action).\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarma brahmodbhavaṁ viddhi brahmākṣara-samudbhavam |\ntasmāt sarva-gataṁ brahma nityaṁ yajñe pratiṣṭhitam ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nKnow that karma (action) originates from Brahma (Vedas). Brahma originates from Akshara (the imperishable Supreme Being). Therefore, the all-pervading Brahma is eternally established in yajna (sacrifice).\n-----------------------------------------------\ne:vam pravarthitham chakram (the wheel that goes in this way)\nThe first one was, anna:th bha:vanthi bhu:tha:ni (all beings are born from food). He went backward from bhu:thas (beings). He continued backwards and reached Akshara. There must be a link, a relation between Akshara and bhu:tha (beings). We can’t seem to find that relation here. He brought up Akshara and Brahma. He started off with beings. Where is the wheel here? However, He said…\ne:vam pravarthitham chakram (the wheel that goes on this way)\nna anuvarthayathi: ha yaha (who do not follow it here)\nOne who does not live in this order…\ne:vam pravarthitham chakram (the wheel that goes on this way)\nna:nuvarthayathi: ha yaha (who do not follow it here)\nThen…\nagha:yuhu (he will age with sins)\nHis life will become sinful. All his years will yield sins. What does he become?\nindriya: ra:maha (He will not walk in the external nature. He will be consumed in the garden of sense organs.)\nmo:gham pa:rttha! sa ji:vathi (His life is useless, O Partha!)\nHe is also someone who has lived. However, his life is mo:gham (useless). Where is the wheel here?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nevaṁ pravartitaṁ cakraṁ nānuvartayatīha yaḥ |\naghāyur indriyārāmo moghaṁ pārtha sa jīvati ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who does not follow this wheel of life, O Partha, lives a life of sin, indulging in the senses, and his life is useless.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen explaining about this wheel, many elders in the past said…\nanna:th bha:vanthi bhu:tha:ni (food gives bhu:thas (beings))\nFood is grown because of clouds. Clouds are formed because of yajnas. Yajna is a result of karma. As per Vedic scriptures, there are various types of karma. Because of karma, yajnas happen. Yajnas exist in the form of karmas. Yajna happens because of karma. Karma is known through Brahma, i.e. from Vedas. All these Vedas are aksharas (imperishable words), i.e. from parama:thma (Supreme Soul), God. They are God’s words. All the meanings are fine. Brahma means Veda. There is nothing wrong. Akshara means Parama:thma (Supreme Soul). There is nothing wrong here too. Karmas are described in Vedas. This is true. The Vedas are the words of Parama:thma (Supreme Soul).\nyasya nisvisitham ve:da:ha (whose breath are the Vedas)\nWe know this. It is fine so far. However, what is the relation between the bhuthas (beings) and Brahma? Akshara means parama:thma (Supreme Soul). Where is the chakrathva (wheel-like connection), the link between parama:thma (Supreme Soul) and bhu:tha (beings)? There should be the link of cause and effect between them. That’s not there. However, everyone explained it in many expositions. Everyone did the same, concluded with Parama:thma (Supreme Soul) and took it upwards directly. Bhu:thas (beings) are sadly left out. If there is anyone who proved and demonstrated cause and effect of everything in a proper order, authentic process, Vedic manner… it is only Bhagavad Ramanujacharya. We should look at his vya:khya:nam (explanation). Then, we will know. Let’s learn what is said there.\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of gurus)."

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nOnly those who wish to utilize the good wisdom bestowed by God properly will see the truths around as they are. Otherwise, they will see those truths twisted. Only those people [who utilize good wisdom properly] will have clarity on what they hear. Others would misinterpret. That [clarity] is independent of age. Also, it is not dependent on the educational qualification of the person.\nThere was a person in a village who would attend all annual ancestral events in every family. He was the only one available, and would be invited [by all] to accept offerings. He would attend as the bho:ktha (one who accepts offerings), one who accepts such offerings [representing the ancestor(s)]. He has a son but he seems to not have much experience in this. He is qualified, but just not as experienced. Generally, people make appointments, booking a day in advance. One day, he was overbooked resulting in two appointments for the same meal. He realized it when one of the two families called him to remind him that morning. He felt bad for overbooking and wondered how he could do justice to both. He had an idea. He thought he could go to one event and send his son to attend the other one. He called his son and informed that he will need to attend a family as a bho:ktha (one who accepts offerings). “I overbooked in error. Please go and attend one family’s event as bho:ktha (one who accepts offerings)”, he said.\nThe son has respect for his father. The son replied, “I will need to follow your order. However, I cannot go.” The father asked why. The son said, “I am experiencing indigestion today. That’s why.” The father got angry because the son was refusing to go but he had already committed. The father said, “I am instructing you. Just go, eat and come.” The son replied, “But I have indigestion, how can I eat? I can’t eat anything now.” He added, “They will serve varieties of food items if I go there. I can’t eat them due to indigestion.” The father asked, “So what? Eat! no problem.” The son asks, “I don’t feel hungry. My stomach is upset. What happens if I eat!” The father asked, “What happens?” The son replied, “What do you mean? I will get sick.” The father asked, “So, what?” The son said, “What are you saying? One should not voluntarily get sick. Isn’t it?” The father said, “What could be the worst outcome of the most horrible disease?” The son said, “How can you think like that? If the disease goes out of control, one can even lose life.” The father said, “That’s it, isn’t it? Whatever I taught you went in vain.” The son asked, “How is that? Didn’t you advise me to follow the rules about eating?” The father said, “Along with all that, didn’t I tell you that a soul gets new bodies one after another?” The son asked, “Yeah, so what is the relation between that and this?” The father said, “para:nnam pra:pya durbuddhe: (Oh, you with a bad intellect, having received food from others)...”\npara:nnam pra:pya (having received food from others)...\n“Such a dumb one you are! If someone is giving you food freely, you should just eat.”\n“Do you think it’s easy to get food just like that in the world? That too, for free?!”\nma: pra:neshe daya:nkuru (Do not show mercy to your life)\n“You should eat happily. All that could happen is that you will lose life in the worst case. That’s it, isn’t it?”\n“Not a big deal. Let the pra:na (life force) leave this body. You will get new pra:na (life force) in a new body.”\npara:nnam durlabham lo:ke: (Food from others is rare in the world)\n“It’s not that easy to get free food.”\npra:na:ha janma ni janma ni (Life after life)\n“If you lose life, you take birth again, thus another body. If that goes, another one comes along.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nja:thasyu hu dhruvo: mruthyuhu\ndhruvam janma mruthasya cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFor one who has taken birth, death is certain; and for one who has died, birth is certain.\n-----------------------------------------------\n“Didn’t Bhagavad Gita preach the same?”\n“Why would you want to stop eating? If not this body, another one is in the pipeline. Eat happily.”\nAll of this sounds logical. It sounds fine. However, what this means is that his intellect is working in the wrong direction. His intellect is not in the right direction. How can we say so? He is teaching that it’s okay to misuse the body that is given for the purpose of dharma (righteous practices), righteous practices. He is teaching that it’s okay to spoil it and even okay to lose life. How can this teaching be right? This is the working of knowledge by those who misuse God’s grace. We need good knowledge and it should take the right path. It should be that which respects God’s direction and makes one think along the same line. If that continues, whatever one does becomes a ya:ga (sacrifice). Then, he would be someone who is properly aligned in the wheel of life.\nWhat is that wheel of life like? We are learning the details of this starting with verse 3.14.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nanna:th bha:vanthi bhu:tha:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll these beings exist because of food.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAll these bhu:thas (beings), beings are existing because of food. A wheel is that which has connected segments, one being the cause of the next one [keeping intact].\nanna:th bhu:tha:ni anna:th bha:vanthi (all these beings are formed with food)\nThe name bhu:thas (beings) [is derived as]…\nbhu:tha (being), bhavanthi:tha bhu:tha:ni (that which is 'happening') or bhavathi:thi bhu:tham (that which is 'happening')\nThat which is ‘happening’ is called bhu:tham (being). An existent object is named sath (existent object). If it exists in one form and undergoes changes, it is called as bhu:tham (being). Every living organism comes under this category. Whether human being or otherwise. They are all called bhu:thas (beings). The term ‘bhu:tha’ (being) is generally heard in the context of some being under bhe:tha (ghostly being), like a ghost. Or other beings like vampires, ghosts, evil spirits etc. God is not referring to that here. Bhu:thas (beings) are those that take a form and undergo systematic growth and decaying. All of them are called bhu:thas (beings). We also existed at one point in time, grew for a duration, decayed for a period, followed by another body. If the body is going through growth and decay, it implies that there is an invisible indwelling entity. Sa:sthra (Vedic scriptures), Vedic scriptures, named it a:thma (soul). When a body and the a:thma (soul) are together, it is called a bhu:tha (being). If a:thma (soul) leaves [from the body], the body is called dead. While indwelling, it gradually goes through a certain ‘happening’. What that means is either it grows or decays. That is why it is called bhu:tha (being). It [the body] is with a:thma (soul) throughout [the limits of the body]. Sri Krishna is referring to these bhu:thas (beings).\nWhat supports all these bhu:thas (beings) to undergo a systematic change? It is because of food. There can be different types of food for human beings, animals, trees, etc. Each one takes different types of food. Whatever it might be, they are growing because of the food consumed. Whatever supports the growth of something, that is called annam (food) [for that specific bhu:tha (being)].\nadyathe: atthicha bhu:tha:ni thasma:th annam thaduchyathe: (That which is eaten and that which eats beings, therefore it is called annam)\nWhatever gets eaten when one consumes it and that which builds him, says Ve:da (Vedic scriptures). It builds him properly if one consumes it in order. Otherwise, it ‘consumes’ him back. There is some food. If we eat it properly [as per recommendation], it enables our growth. Otherwise, if we overeat because it's tasty, it will ‘consume’ us. What does it mean by ‘it consumes us’? It means we’ll end up in hospitals, take medicines, or go through something more. He could get diseased, could get further affected by the medicines, gradually weakened and worse. That which builds him if consumed in order and ‘consumes’ him up if he takes in disorder is called annam (food). That is why annam (food) is being called as that which makes or breaks. It is called ji:va:thu ma:huhu (called the life-giver) or mruthyum a:huhu (called death). It is called ji:va:thu (life-giver, medicine), the ‘medicine’ which grows him. Annam (food) itself is a medicine. We need not to go to a drug store for such medicine. If annam (food) is taken systematically, it becomes a wonderful medicine as well. That is why, our people included leaves, fruits, liquids, grains, and lentils in food. If they are all prepared in an order, it becomes annam (food). It becomes ji:va:thu (life-giver, medicine). If taken in disorder, it becomes mruthyu (deadly, death), deadly. Ve:dam (Vedic scriptures) says this. Annam (food) is that which is experienced. Due to the existence of this ‘experienceable food’, i.e., eating it/living off of it, bhu:thas (beings) exist. We all know that if food is eaten in order, it keeps us growing. We know that it could kill us otherwise. We are not seeing how there is a wheel in this process. It is not visible but runs everything behind the scenes. That is the reason why sa:sthra (Vedic scriptures), authoritative scriptures, have come forward to explain the same. Sri Krishna’s teaching became necessary as Bhagavad Gita. Thus, we should listen to sa:sthra (Vedic scriptures), observe it in life and practice with faith.\nLet us ‘enter’ the cycle now.\nanna:th bha:vanthi bhu:tha:ni (all these beings exist because of food)\nWe know what bhu:tham (being) is. It consists of two. One is the externally visible body. The second is the underlying operating entity called a:thma (soul), soul. They are together called one bhu:tha (being). Remember this. All these bhu:thas (beings) are existent because of food. Only when the soul is together with the body, can a being eat anything. Otherwise, [without the soul] even if a few tasty gula:b ja:muns (sweet dumplings) are given to the body, they won’t be consumed. Not a drop of the sugar syrup nor the thulasi rasa (holy basil extract), holy basil extract, will go in. If the soul is indwelling, then he would do something to consume it. A body is called a bhu:tham (being) only when it is along with the soul. All the bhu:thas (beings) grow only because of the food they consume. This is where food is the cause [for bhu:thas (beings)].\nWhat is the cause for food?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nparjanya:th anna sambhvaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFood is produced from rain.\n-----------------------------------------------\nFood must first grow to a state of becoming consumable. The cause for their growth is water. It could be grains, seeds, trees, or any other beings. They all need water to grow. Therefore, water is essential. Where does the water come from? Oceans are filled with water but not consumable. That water must evaporate into parjanya (rain-bearing clouds), rain-bearing clouds, and fall as rain where you are. It needs to rain onto the ground, into rivers, wells, lakes, or be dug from underground. Only if it pours as rain, it becomes potable. Only then, it can grow the food. Therefore, it’s not enough that oceans and soil exist for grains and seeds to develop. [Water from oceans] should transform to potable water by forming clouds. That is why Krishna did not say water is the cause for growing food. He said\nparjanya:d anna sambhvaha (because of clouds)\nFood will grow only because of [ocean/sea] water transformed as clouds. That [clouds] is the reason for this [growth of food].\nWhere do these [clouds] come from? How are the clouds formed? This is the important question.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyajna:th bhavathi parjanyaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nRain is produced from yajna (sacrifice).\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe clouds form from\nyajna:th bhavathi (from yajna, it happens)\nWe have been discussing yajna (sacrifice, righteous action) from the start of chapter 3. Clouds are formed with the power from life led as yajna (sacrifice, righteous action). You might think, why would clouds be formed that way? When heat from the Sun evaporates water, that water is formed as a cloud. If that is the case, the Sun exists all the time, water exists all the time, shouldn’t the sky be filled with clouds? However, clouds are not formed that way. The power of Sun rays of only certain times causes rain-bearing clouds. There are other clouds that are visible but don’t bear rain. They are at different levels. Despite any level they are at, they should not just be any cloud, but rather a rain-bearing one. We must remember this. Only such clouds are called ‘parjanyas’ (rain-bearing clouds). They are formed because of yajna (sacrifice, righteous action).\nHow does a yajna (sacrifice, righteous action) take place? We learned earlier that a human’s every action must become yajna (sacrifice, righteous action).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyajnaha karma samudbhavaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYajna (sacrifice) is born of karma (action).\n-----------------------------------------------\nYajna (sacrifice, righteous action) must result when karma (action) is performed. What is karma (action)?\nkarma (action), kri:yathe: ithi karma (that which is done is called karma)\nWhatever we are doing is called karma (action). Only when someone does something, it is called karma (action). What is done is called kriya (action). Kriyas (actions) performed in a certain way, are called karma (action). Someone must do it.\nyajnaha karma samudbhavaha (yajna is born of karma)\nIt is said something must be done, right? What is it that is doing the work? We must carefully observe this part. What is it that is doing the work?\nyajnaha karma samudbhavaha (yajna is born of karma)\nIf karma (action) must happen, some work should be done. Who is it that is doing the work? Let’s think. Let’s think attentively. Let’s learn about it then.\nJai Srimannarayana!\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of teachers)"

    "episode": 37,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nThere are great pu:rva:cha:ryas (practicing spiritual masters), who properly analyzed knowledge bestowed by God. They graced the same unto us in an easily comprehensible way. Those great souls graced the teachings applicable to those times for the people then. Perhaps, people were thus inspired by them. However, when the desire is to show a universally qualified path for all times… Observe the teachings of the a:cha:ryas (spiritual teachers) that appropriately correlated the preceding and the following. Bhagavad Ra:ma:nuja A:cha:rya Swa:mi (Ramanujacharya Swami), through such qualified commentaries for God’s instruction, Bhagavad Gi:tha (Bhagavad Gita)… Bestowed to us a wonderful reconciliation, and flawless order for the process instructed by Sri Krishna. Observe chapter 3 where… He [Sri Krishna] presented a wheel saying… e:vam pravarthitham chakram (thus the wheel is set in motion). He [Ra:ma:nuja:cha:rya] showed the reconciliation for it [the ‘segments’ of the ‘wheel’]. We are currently learning how that is done.\nWe are all called bhu:thas (beings), a being with body and soul. We are all growing because of food. Food is the [supporting] cause for us. How is the food produced? Bhagavad Gi:tha (Bhagavad Gita) verse 3.14 explains this. Food is produced because of parjanya (cloud). It is produced because of the rains from the clouds. How are the rains showered? How are the clouds formed? Yajnas (sacrifices) cause the formation of clouds. yajna:th bha:vathi parjanyaha (from yajna comes rain). How can a yajna (sacrifice) form a cloud? Ve:da (Vedas) answered this.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nagnou pra:stha:husthisamyak a:dithyamupathishtathe:\na:ditya:th ja:yathe: vrustihi vrushte:rannam thathah praja:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOblations properly offered into fire reach the sun. From the sun comes rain. From rain comes food. From food come living beings.\n-----------------------------------------------\nagnou pra:stha:huthihi (When an eligible person offers an oblation in a bonafide process into fire using right ingredients at the right time), It releases ho:ma dhu:ma (smoke from that offering). That is very powerful. Only such [ho:ma dhu:ma] will become impactful. If some kind of an odd person simply lights fire and drops something into it some random way, It will release pollution into nature. If it is performed in an order, what does it do? a:dithyamupathishtathe: (It’s not stating that the [smoke] goes to the sun. It states that it brings the sun's power to us). Sunrays are always all surrounding because we are in the solar system. We are in the family of the sun. We come under the control of the sun. All the planets that revolve around the sun are controlled by the power of the sun. Our earth is the third planet [from the sun]. We are also happily under the influence of that sun. It does not matter if it is day or night, we are living under the control of the sun. When oblation is offered into the fire… Ho:ma dhu:ma (sacred smoke) released adds special power to the rays traveling from the sun controlling the earth. a:dithyam upathishtathe: (prepares sun to be pleased with us). Water that gets evaporated by the heat from those powerful sun rays forms into a parjanya (rain-bearing cloud). Otherwise… The sun is always there. Water is always there. Clouds should have always been forming. They should always be there. It should always be raining. Earth should always be filled with water. That’s not the case. This is the aspect we must pay attention to. How that happens is a different topic. However, it is the ho:ma prakriya (process of havan and ho:ma dhu:ma (sacred smoke)), that energizes the sun rays. It is those sun rays which form the rain bearing clouds. It is those clouds that go all around because of the movement of air and rain here and there. It is there that the crops yield. a:ditya:th ja:yathe: vrustihi (That is why, it rains only because of the sun). vrushte:he annam (It is because of rain that any beings needing to eat grow, the same goes for plants and trees). thathah praja:ha (Eating that, living beings take birth and the journey of life continues). Ve:da (Vedas) explains this.\nTherefore, we must first know how to perform activity as yajna (sacrifice). We alluded earlier that… One type of yajna (sacrifice) is where ho:ma dhu:ma (sacred smoke) is brought out by offering ghee into a havan kunda (fire pit). The mere dhu:ma (smoke) has a kind of power. The power of that dhu:ma (smoke) can get rid of all do:shas (faults) in nature, like viruses or anything else. If we can perform large scale yajnas (sacrifices) properly, we can reap benefits of that kind. That is why, we planned the Ra:ma:nuja Sahasra:bdi event to host 1035 yajna kundas (fire pits). Using pure desi cow ghee derived from churned yogurt etc., we are moving forward accordingly. It will clean nature. It will empower the sun rays. It will enable all the clouds forming in the future to give good water. This is there [in nature].\nNow [the other type of yajna (sacrifice)]... All the work we do every minute brings out waves of bha:vana (feelings), which affect the sun rays. In the process of ho:ma (fire ritual), it is the power of manthra (sacred chant) and the smoke. Here within us, it is the releasing of bha:vana: tharangas (waves of feelings). For example, cooking for someone. If you feel compassion and that it is righteous to pacify someone’s hunger… Then the resulting effect is one type. If you see that person as a manifestation of God, and what you did was an offering to Him… The resulting effect of that wave of feeling is different. This will empower the sun rays. Whether the power results from a dravya (substance) being offered, or a human being, it empowers the sun rays. This is called yajna (sacrifice). yajna:th bha:vathi parjanyaha (from yajna comes rain). Sri Krishna states this in verse 3.14. How is a yajna (sacrifice) formed? [yajnah] karma samudbhavaha (yajna is born from action). The bha:vana (feeling), a feeling you have, is classified as one type of karma (action). The bodily act of giving or taking something or changing something is another type of karma (action). kri:yathe: (it is done). You are doing it. That act becomes karma (action). What is the basis for doing karma (action)? karma brahmo:dbhavam viddhi (know that action is born from Brahma).\nHe says that karma (action) should happen because of bramha (Brahma). This is where it becomes tricky. Many people think Bramha (Brahma) here means Ve:da (Vedas). Ve:da (Vedas) talks about yajna (sacrifice) and ya:ga (ritual) etc. So, that is the karma (action). karma brahmo:dbhavam (action is born from Brahma). [It was interpreted as] Karmas (actions) came from Ve:da (Vedas). Karmas (actions) are defined in Ve:da (Vedas) but it is not the reason for karma (action). Karmas (actions) are not created by Ve:da (Vedas). Yajna (sacrifice) is creating the clouds. Food is created by the clouds. Beings are being created by the food. Ve:das (Vedas) did not create karmas (actions). Karmas (actions) are only explained by Ve:da (Vedas). Hence, there is no cause-and-effect relation between karma (action) and brahma (Brahma), i.e. Ve:da (Vedas). Therefore, it does not fit in to refer to bramha (Brahma) as Ve:da (Vedas). Additionally, no work is being done by Ve:da (Vedas). Someone studying Ve:da (Vedas) will be doing karma (action) [not Ve:da (Vedas) itself]. If something has to be done, it must be done through the body. Therefore, bramha (Brahma) [here] means body. If the body does something, then karma (action) is being done. Whatever karma (action) it is - giving something or taking or changing or making or building. All of this is the work that we do. That is done by the body. The work is done through a living body. If life is not in the body, it is called sthitham (still). Like when bodies are placed into a box. sari:ram thathra sthitham (the body is lying there). The dead body is lying there. Whatever ‘happens’ with the dead body is not called yajna (sacrifice). Yajna (sacrifice) is something that is done by someone. That someone should be a living being. If one is living, then the work is being done. That living one is the body. Therefore, bramham (Brahma) means sari:ra (body).\nWe may feel, “Do we just interpret the way we desire?” “No, we are not saying whatever we wish to.” Ve:da (Vedas) declares it. “Is it said anywhere that bramha (Brahma) also means body?” Yes, in Mundako:panishad (Mundaka Upanishad). Even in further sections of Bhagavad Gi:tha (Bhagavad Gita), God Himself declares the same. What is the body made of? It is made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements), the five elements of Nature. Our body is the product of the pancha bhu:thas (five elements). Isn’t it? Not just our bodies, every body is made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements). The body is made of the mixture of earth, water, fire, air, and ether. It is a union of the five elements. Hence, it is also nature. This is a micro form of prakruthi (nature). Everything around is the macro form. It is clearly specified that God is creating this.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:th e:thath bramha: na:ma ru:pam annam cha ja:yathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFrom Him (the all-knowing, all-wise Supreme Being) comes this Brahma (the body, nature), along with name, form, and food.\n-----------------------------------------------\nMundako:panishad (Mundaka Upanishad) states… thasmath (from Him). Who is that? yassarvajnaha sarvavith yasya jna:namayam thapaha (Whoever is the knower of everything. Whoever knows about every single thing). sarvajnaha (one who knows everything in general). sarvavith (one who knows everything to detail by each anu (smallest measurable unit)). yasya jna:namayam thapaha (all His thought is filled with knowledge). thasma:th (from Him). e:thath bramha: (emerged this prakruthi (nature), the body which is the manifested form of nature). bramha (Brahma) means bruhathi (that which grows), brumhayathi (wherever it dwells, it grows that entity as well). What is this body doing? It is growing. It is also growing the knowledge of the indwelling soul. Therefore, it can also be named bramha (Brahma). e:thath bramha (The name, form and the food that it (the body) needs to grow [for the body]). All these are… thasma:th ja:yathe: (are coming from parama:thma (the supreme soul), God). Mundako:panishad (Mundaka Upanishad) explains this.\nDiving deeper… mama yo:nir mahad bramha: (My womb is the great Brahma). God Himself stated… mahath bramha: (the vast prakruthi (nature)). yo:nihi (the cause for all of this is). mama (my object). He clearly states, “all this prakruthi (nature) is Mine.” Therefore bramham (Brahma) means body. It does not mean Ve:da (Vedas) or anything else. Now [let’s see] how this body is formed? brahma:kshara samudbhavam (Brahma is born from Akshara).\nWhat does akshara (indestructible) mean? Akshara (indestructible) is that which is not kshara (destructible). Many people said it therefore means parama:thma (supreme soul), God. It is true that parama:thma (supreme soul) has ‘Akshara’ as a name. No question about it. e:thasyava: aksharasya prasha:sane: ga:rgi (Gargi, under the command of this indestructible Akshara). It is because of Akshara (the indestructible), the indestructible parama:thma (supreme soul), that everything is up and running. Ya:jnavalka’s (Yajnavalkya's) teachings say so. Akshara (indestructible) means parama:thma (supreme soul). No question about it. However, that is not the context here. The question here is who is the cause for the body. It is the indwelling a:thma (soul). If present, the body functions. A:thma (soul) is akshara (indestructible). It has no kshara (the quality of being destroyed). The indestructible a:thma (soul) and the body, called as ‘bramha’ (Brahma), are together. What do we call the two together? It is called bhu:tha (a living being). i.e, a body and soul together. What forms the bhu:tha (living being)? Annam (food). What creates annam (food)? Parjanya (rain-bearing clouds). What creates parjanya (rain-bearing clouds)? Yajna (sacrifice). What is the cause for yajna (sacrifice)? Karma (action). What’s the cause for karma (action)? The body. What is the cause for the body? A:thma (soul). When the body and a:thma (soul) are in union, it is a bhu:tha (living being). The cause for bhu:tha (living being) is again [annam (food)]. e:vam pravarthitham chakram (thus the wheel is set in motion).\nThat is the chakra (wheel), the wheel. Ra:ma:nuja:cha:rya Swa:mi (Ramanujacharya Swami) wonderfully proved the intended meaning of this chakram (wheel), wheel, to us. Thus, he established the real meaning of Sri Krishna’s words and… [He] graced it to us in his Gi:tha Bha:shyam (commentary of Bhagavad Gita). The direction set by such a great soul, uplifts us. Let’s move forward.\nJai Srimannarayana! Vande: guru parampara:m! (I bow to the lineage of teachers!)"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m lo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham (I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nOne should always perform any work in accordance with the situation. It is a general principle. Not only working, one must also speak in accordance with the situation. Not only in worldly aspects, one must work realizing the situation even when working with the scriptural aspects. This is the recommended rule. Behaving against the situation will lead to unwanted situations.\nAssume a lady is named ‘Pankajam’. Quite a few are named Pankajam. What is the meaning of the name? Panka (thick mud), ja (born in). Pankajam (lotus) means that which is born from thick mud. What all are born from thick mud? “Oho! She is Pankajam.” It can be very upsetting if we say that to her, implying she was born in such an environment. It could mean water-weeds, snails, mud, grass or something else. It is true that the word has that meaning. Anything born from it can be named as Pankajam. However, if the situation is such that one wants to refer to a person or something about her, then, one could say “Ah! your face is glowing like a pankajam (lotus)!” Here, the word pankajam (lotus) cannot be compared to be water-weeds, or snails or mud etc. When the context is about a glowing face, one should use the pankajam (lotus) which conveys the meaning of glow. There are many things that emerge from [the muddy waters]. However, the one that indicates glow or gives a pleasant feel is a water lily or lotus or __. We should be using only that [lotus] and simply place the others [like weeds, snails] aside. Words have different meanings. This is true in all languages. It is the responsibility of wise people to use whatever is right for the context. Only those who have undergone right teachings will have that ability. For others, it will be a little difficult.\nBhagavad Ramanujacharya Swami gained proper edification. Therefore, he was able to provide the right meanings to God’s teaching, Bhagavad Gita, properly correlating the beginning to the end and throughout without causing any conflicts. If you go through Gita Bhashya (his commentary) for Bhagavad Gita, we can understand. As an example, we are learning about the word chakra (wheel), in chapter 3. God says…\nev:am pravarthitham chakram (Whoever leads life following the chakra (wheel), only he will be recognised as someone who has lived.) Otherwise, he would be regarded as dead. That’s what He said.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nevam pravartitam cakram\nnānuvartayatīha yaḥ |\naghāyur indriyārāmo\nmoghaṁ pārtha sa jīvati ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nO Partha (Arjuna), he who does not follow this wheel thus set in motion, living a life of sin, indulging in the senses, lives in vain.\n-----------------------------------------------\nOnly in Ramanujacharya’s Bhashya (commentary) do we see the chakra (wheel) realized properly. Where is the chakra (wheel)? Explaining the way we live…\nanna:th bha:vanthi bhu:tha:ni (The bhu:thas (beings/bodies), bodies made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements of Nature) are living because of annam (food).) When we say bhu:thas (beings/bodies), we must remember the soul and the body. Only when they are together, they are called bhu:tha (being/body). That is when they are living because of annam (food). Annam (food) is grown because of clouds, i.e water from the clouds. Clouds are formed because of yajna (sacrifice). When yajna (sacrifice) is performed properly, i.e. when you live life properly, the effect of bha:va tharanga (vibrations of the feel) with which you live rise within you, and the ho:ma dhu:ma (smoke from the oblations) into the havan. The clouds are then formed such that they yield good water because of the [energized] sun rays. Those clouds are formed because of yajna (sacrifice). Yajna (sacrifice) is based on one’s karma (action). Karma (action) can only be done by sari:ras (bodies). Sari:ra (body) is called bramha (Brahman/body).\nkarma brahmo:dbhavam viddhi (karma is born from Brahman)\nBramha (Brahman/body), i.e. body is…\naksharam samudbhavam (born from the imperishable)\nOnly when there is a soul, the body takes form, grows, and undergoes change. Otherwise, the body remains for some time and gradually disintegrates to its elements. It is the aksharam (imperishable) that keeps the body intact from disintegrating. Aksharam (imperishable) is that which is not kshara (disintegrable). Atma (soul) has a name called akshara (imperishable). Both soul and paramatma (God) are given the name akshara (imperishable). The nithya su:ris (eternally liberated souls) are also named akshara (imperishable). What is the context here? The context with respect to chakra (wheel) is to refer to that which is with the body. Therefore, this ‘wheel’ runs with the body, and the body is living because of the soul.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntasmāt sarva-gataṁ brahma\nnityaṁ yajñe pratiṣṭhitam ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, the all-pervading Brahman is eternally established in sacrifice.\n-----------------------------------------------\nsarvagatham bramha (We must observe this word [sarvagatham (all-pervading)] properly.)\nsarvagatham bramha (sarva (with all beings); gatham (that exist); bramha (all the bodies)) Or the body which is made for or is the means for performing all varieties of activities…\nnithyam yajne: prathishttitham (It [body] must always work as yajna (sacrifice).)\nBodies must always be used as yajna (sacrifice). If you think that you will simply live, not be useful to anyone, not meditate on anyone, die… Sri Krishna clearly states in verse 3.15 that such a life is not worth nothing.\nthasma:th sarvagatham bramha nithyam yajne: prathishttitham || (Bodies given for the purpose of exercising karma (action) must live as yajna (sacrifice).)\nThey must live as yajna (sacrifice). Or else they are dead bodies. Now, this qualifies for chakra (wheel), the ‘wheel’. When the body is used for yajna (sacrifice), it is because of the soul. When both body and soul are together, it becomes bhu:tha (being/body). Bhu:tha (being/body) lives because of annam (food). Annam (food) is because of the [clouds]. Does atma (soul) have a name called akshara (imperishable)? Yes. If you use akshara (imperishable) in reference to paramatma (God), it does not fit in [to chakra (wheel)]. If you use it to refer to the atma (soul), it fits in as body and soul become a bhu:tha (being/body). Once you can get to bhu:tha (being/body), that completes the chakra (wheel). You can see [referring atma (soul) as Akshara (imperishable)] in Bhagavad Gita and many instances in Upanishads.\nLet’s look at where it is in Bhagavad Gita. In chapter 8…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nakṣaraṁ brahma paramaṁ\nsvabhāvo ’dhyātmam ucyate |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe imperishable is the supreme Brahman; its essential nature is called the individual soul.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn the beginning of Ch. 8 itself, which is named akshara para brahma yo:ga (Yoga of the Imperishable Supreme Brahman), He says atma (soul) is called akshara (imperishable). Proceeding a little further to beginning of Chapter 12, Arjuna asks two questions. The first one is…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nevaṁ satata-yuktā ye\nbhaktās tvāṁ paryupāsate |\nye cāpy akṣaram avyaktaṁ\nteṣāṁ ke yoga-vittamāḥ ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose devotees who are always steadfast and worship You, and those who worship the imperishable, unmanifested – which of these are better versed in yoga?\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere are some who meditate upon You…\ne: cha:pyaksharam avyaktham (There are those meditating upon Akshara thaththva (the undestroyable reality/truth of the imperishable).)\nIt is true that bhagava:n (God) is named Akshara (imperishable). However, Arjuna asked, “Of both, those meditating on You and those meditating Akshara thaththva (the undestroyable reality/truth of the imperishable), who is intelligent?” He asked this question.\nthe:sha:m ke: yo:ga viththama:ha (What akshara (imperishable) refers to here is atma (soul) in the context of those meditating upon the soul.)\nFurther in chapter 12, Sri Krishna refers to it while explaining, “Whoever meditates upon the soul is going to have a very hard time. Whoever meditates upon Me will find it very easy.” How easy it is and what are the steps to attain this easy One... He showed gradually one after another all the steps in meditating upon Him. In Ch 12, He also stated how difficult it is to meditate upon akshara (imperishable), i.e atma thatthva (reality of soul). We will learn about it in detail when we get there. Sri Krishna used akshara (imperishable) in both these contexts to refer to atma (soul). It is clear in these verses. Therefore, when the wheel is being talked about…\nbramha akshara samudbhavam (Brahman is born from the imperishable)\nIf we take akshara (imperishable) to mean atma (soul), the wheel is clearly established. We will also properly understand what Sri Krishna is conveying [the chakra (wheel)]. After explaining about the chakra (wheel), Sri Krishna says, “It is essential for all human beings to act according to this wheel.” He elucidated this way of life. Questions like why should one work this way, what is the necessity to work, what will happen if we don’t… First of all, it’s impossible to not do anything. You have to breathe. You can’t abstain from drinking water, or eating food. Even if you claim you can go without food or water, you still need to breathe air. If you say you will do kumbhaka (retaining air) for a year, 2, 3 or more. Fine. You are still living depending on the five elements of nature. That is you are still living in the body. After you leave the body, that’s different. That is when others perform final rites. However, while in the body, it is impossible to not do anything by yourself. In that case, instead of wasting life, live properly. Live life as yajna (sacrifice).\nWho is this needed for? For anyone taking birth and living a life. Do you know who it is not needed for? Bhagava:n (God) says for in the next verse, 3.17.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyas tv ātma-ratir eva syād\nātma-tṛptaś ca mānavaḥ |\nātmany eva ca santuṣṭas\ntasya kāryaṁ na vidyate ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBut for the person who rejoices in the Self, who is satisfied with the Self, and who is content in the Self alone, there is no duty to perform.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is only that one who does not need to do yajna (sacrifice). Who is that? One who does not need anything other than ji:va (soul), and the jna:na (knowledge). One may say, “There are some who are like that in some places.” If so, such people should have nothing to do with the world. They shouldn’t be preaching either in this world. There need not be any enlightenment, or worshiping, or anything. There shouldn’t be any donations either. If one seeks all these, how can such a person be called a:thma rathi (inclined towards atma/rejoices in the Self)? Therefore, such a person cannot be called a:thma rathi (inclined towards atma/rejoices in the Self).\na:thmarathir (whoever is inclined only towards atma (soul))\na:thma thrupthas cha ma:navaha (whoever is happy with only atma (soul)/satisfied with the Self)\na:thmanye:va cha santhushtaha (whoever is satisfied only with the activities related to atma (soul)/content in the Self alone)\nSuch a person has no connection with anything.\nthasya ka:ryam na vidyathe: (there is no work that he needs to do)\nIt is not necessary to specially focus now on learning to lead life as yajna (sacrifice) for him. He attained siddhi (accomplishment/perfection). This state is only for nithya su:ris (eternally liberated souls), and muktha ganas (liberated souls). It is impossible to be that way for one living on this earth. Therefore, it is the divine injunction to live life as yajna (sacrifice) for all those born [on the earth]. Thus, Ch. 3 establishes the need to qualify any work we do as yo:gam (yoga/union), i.e. doing so as yajna (sacrifice). Bestowing us with this knowledge, He is leading us further. Let us try to learn further.\nJai Srimannarayana!\nVande: Guru Parampara:m!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the entire world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nTo attain something, there will be a means to do so. The means for attaining something is different from the attaining object or the result. We refer to them as sa:dhana (means) and sa:dhya (goal). In Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna did not know who he was and who were the ones around. He was not able to realize who they were. That is why he forgot his duty. There is a supreme prescribed means [for everyone]. Being born as a human being, one must fulfill their responsibilities. He forgot that. He forgot the ‘means’. However, he felt he had the sa:dhya (goal) in his hands.\nWhat is it that one must attain for being born as a human being? tharinchaali (to cross over/attain liberation). This word is explained in many various ways. Some say - it means to attain mo:ksha (liberation from bondages). Some say - to attain bramhaikya (to become one with the Supreme Being). Some say - to attain paramapada (the supreme state). Some say - to be doing bhagavad kainkarya (serving God). Some say - it means to have nothing to do. Whatever we think it is, they are all what happens after one leaves the body. It could be Vaikuntta (Vishnu's abode), Kailasa (Shiva's abode), Bramhaikya (oneness with the Supreme Being), Kainkarya (service), etc. All these are something you attain afterwards.\nWhat should we do while here, however? You are in this body for a certain time period. While here, one must do all the duties that came with the body without any compromise. This uncompromising duty orientedness is applicable to everybody. What does everybody refer to? In the world, all human beings are divided into four categories. What are the four?\nvidya:rtthi dasa (stage of a student)\nga:rhasthya dasa (stage with responsibility of family)\nva:naprasttha dasa (stage with focus on learning about the Supreme)\nyo:ga dasa (stage of a realized person)\nIrrespective of country residence or anything else, every person has the following four states in life. First - ba:lya dasa (stage of a child). Or vidya:rtthi dasa (stage of earning vidya, education). It is named as bramhacharyam (celibate student life). After a certain period in this stage, one becomes gruhasthu (householder). He takes up the responsibility of the dharma (righteous duty) of passing forward his activities to his children. It is named ga:rhasthya stage. This will go on for a certain period of time. There are some rules around how long it should last. That responsibility should last only till your children practice the good lifestyle you learned from your elders and passed on. The responsibility does not encompass the prosperity of grandkids, and great grandkids. This [gruhasttha stage] goes on for sometime. It is the responsibility of a gruhasttha (householder) to take care of the child until they grow and are able to stand on their feet. Afterward, he shouldn’t make himself responsible for anything related further. He should be accessible to give any advice or to offer any inputs but not to take any responsibility. He should start thinking about his own well-being. What does it mean by well-being here? Not just bodily well-being, but what is essential to do for the well-being of the indwelling ji:va (individual soul).\nWhat should one do? Keeping aside the bodily responsibilities, learning what the soul’s responsibilities are. Focusing on that [learning], and using the body for whatever time period God graces the body as a means. This stage is called va:naprasttha (forest dweller/retirement stage). Earlier days, they would go to vana (forests), and live there. There are no forests these days. It’s all concrete jungles. Even if one goes to forests, he would need a concrete structure if he wants to live comfortably. Va:naprasttha (forest dweller/retirement stage) is a beautiful word that denotes what one should be thinking about. ‘Vana’ is the name for God. Va:namu (that which is related to Him) is that which is related to Him, i.e. His supreme qualities benefit us all. He created this world. Isn’t He benefitting us? Without even asking, He is giving us abundant air, water, sunlight, etc. He is giving this Earth the power to produce whatever we need as food. All these did not come into existence because we desired for them. They came into existence because of God’s ‘work’. There are the utthama upaka:ra gunas (supreme beneficial qualities), supreme qualities that are favoring us. Kalya:na gunas (auspicious qualities) are those that present us with…\nsubha (good outcomes),\nbaagu (state of well-being),\nujji:vana (better life/spiritual upliftment).\nHe has the abilities to give us these. They are called gunas (qualities). How many such gunas (qualities) exist? bahavo: kalya:na guna:ha (many auspicious qualities). There are so many that it is impossible to count. That many kalya:na gunas (auspicious qualities), qualities blessing with all that is good. They are named so. This is not our interpretation. Ve:das (Vedas) says - swa:bhaviki: jna:na bala kriya: cha (His inherent knowledge, strength, and action). His form is also kalya:na maya (full of goodness). etthe: ru:pam kalya:na thamam thath the: pasya:mi (Let me witness that divine supreme form of Yours that graces ultimate good to everyone). Veda taught us the prayer, ‘Let me witness that divine supreme form of Yours that graces ultimate good to everyone.’ What it means is that God has both qualities and a form that are beneficial to the world. That is called vana (God).\n[During va:naprasttha stage], one remains sttha (focused) on that [vana]. In fact, a human being should be habituated to reflect and focus on God’s divine qualities. Even during gruhasthu (householder) stage and for everyone throughout. It should be in that habit for everyone, however, there is no chance to spend full time on that in earlier stages. Either one is busy with children, or studying, or fulfilling family responsibilities or acquiring many social abilities. Therefore, it would be possible to stha (focus) on vana (God), only to a certain extent [during those stages]. Now [during va:naprasttha stage], there is nothing new to be learned. What you have on your plate now is only to recollect that which has already been learned. Family related activities have subsided because kids are grown and living independently. When you involve excessively, voluntarily taking responsibility and giving advice, [the kids] could get upset and put you in an old-age home. A wise man will not involve too much, simply rather letting them be. That’s when both sides will be comfortable. Therefore, he won’t have those responsibilities either. Thus, because he can now [in va:naprasttha stage] concentrate deeper on his ujji:vana (spiritual upliftment)… Reflecting how he was molded to what he is now by vana (God), and His divine qualities and form… One can dedicate more time in pra - sttha (highly focusing) at the right time on vana (God).\nThus, one should not confirm another job soon before retirement. And continue to find and eventually confirm another job before retiring from the next one post the first one. Continuing to find another job to earn and repeat when that is done… simply working and earning until their last breath, not even able to use that wealth before they leave. Yet, some other person will take away all those earnings and enjoy it all. After leaving a portion to his children, a wise one should use the rest of his earnings for the remainder of his life. He can spend time reflecting on God, and to the extent that he can, take part in service and activities related to God. If he can do that, it is referred to by another stage/part-journey of life.\nThere are four semi-journeys in life - one is bramhacharya (celibate student life), second is ga:rhasttha (householder stage). The third one as discussed now is va:naprasttha (forest dweller/retirement stage). One travels in this journey portion for a certain period of time. Using whatever earning or sa:dhana (means) in this va:naprasstha (forest dweller/retirement stage) portion… He will step into the final phase called yo:ga (spiritual realization) or sannya:sa (renunciation) where he works on sa:ksha:thka:ra (realization), realizing that sa:dhana (means). Thus, the 4 stages are - bramhacharya (celibate student life), ga:rhasthya (householder stage), va:naprasttha (forest dweller/retirement stage), and sannya:sa (renunciation). For everyone who is in any of these four states, there are certain things to do.\nInterestingly, some think karma a:charana (performing actions), being in action, is only necessary to a certain stage in life. They think, after crossing that stage, one can do karma thya:ga (giving up activities). Sa:sthra (scripture/guiding orders), that literature which has guiding orders, never accepts karma thya:ga (giving up activities). Through the entire Bhagavad Gita, we never see that Sri Krishna accepted this. There will be activities. When one is bramhacha:ri (celibate student), he will need to beg for alms, and submit them to his teacher… Accepting whatever his teacher gives him as food, learning what is to be taught by the teacher. These are karmas (actions/duties), activities, of a bramhacha:ri (celibate student). As gruhasttha (householder), there are quite a few karmas (actions/duties) such as daily activities, etc. There is karma a:charana (performing actions) then too. Even after entering the va:naprasstha (forest dweller/retirement stage), he enjoys God’s divine qualities and corresponding teachings. So, there are certain types of activities one takes up. Lastly, even as sannya:si (renunciate), one must conduct work giving up the doership (sense of being the doer), results, and attachment. This is known as naishkarmyam (action without attachment to results). naishkarmyam a:chare:th (one should perform action without attachment). This is what mo:ksha parva (chapter on liberation) of Maha:bha:ratha (Mahabharata) states.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nabhayam sarva bhu:the:bhyo: datthva: naishakarmyam a:chare:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHaving given fearlessness to all beings, one should perform action without attachment.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf one can stop activities, why would it state a:chare:th (to do/perform)? We don’t say practice quitting activities, do we? Therefore, he will give up something with respect to the karma (action). “I am doing the work”, “It is because of me that this is happening”, “All this is for me”. These three bha:vanas (feelings/attitudes) exist. One must give up these feelings, not the karmas (actions/duties), activities, themselves. This is called thrividha thya:ga (threefold renunciation), giving up the three types of attachment with the karma (action). Remember it is not the karma (action) you are giving up. It is to give up the inherent bha:vana (feeling/attitude) when performing karma (action). Eat food. But change the bha:vana (feeling/attitude) from eating to satisfy your stomach, to honoring prasa:dam (sacred offering), offering to Lord within. Sannya:sis (renunciates) also perform karma (action). No one is permitted karma thya:ga (giving up activities).\nHowever, Arjuna is thinking that if he becomes a jna:ni (enlightened one), then there is no need to do karma (action). The prescribed karma (action) for him currently is to fight in the war, suppress the bad, encourage the good. That is why the stage is set for war. He and others have assembled. If he is now wishing to quit, it means he lost a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul) revealing who he is, and why he is here. Therefore, he must be made aware of a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul). Sri Krishna felt responsible to teach him a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul), accordingly enlighten him of his duty, and motivate him to take it up. During this teaching, Arjuna thinks he does not need to do any karma (action). That is not allowed. This is a cycle. It is a life cycle. He starts at anna:th bhavanthi (from food, beings are born). And [ends at]... e:vam pravarthitham chakram (thus the cycle is maintained). This is a life-cycle. No one is exempt from it. Everyone must take part in the cycle, everyone in any of the four stages must live through this cycle. If one must live through it, Arjuna felt… yajnah karma samudbhavaha (sacrifice is born from action), karma brahmo:dbhavam viddhi… (know that action originates from the Supreme Being), thasma:th sarvagatham bramha nithyam yajne:... (therefore, the all-pervading Supreme Being is eternally established in sacrifice). Everyone’s life should be led as yajna (sacrifice). He already wanted to give up karma (action), why yajna (sacrifice) now?! He asked, “Therefore, can I not give up [karma (action)] now?” Yes, it can be done. However, Lord made it clear on who can. It’s not possible for those living on this earth. If there is anyone beyond earth they can give up karma (action). He tells this to Arjuna and makes him aware of a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul).\nThe reason we are reflecting on this is because… We think a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul) is not practical for life. We think it is not necessary for us now. However, that is not true. A:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul) is to know clearly who you are. A:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (realization of the soul) also means the same. This is the purpose of Sri Krishna’s [teaching]. For that purpose, Lord is revealing who must do karma a:charana (performing actions) and who is eligible for karma thya:ga (giving up actions). In chapter 3, He is thus taking Arjuna forward. Let us also move along with them.\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

We are all called bhuthas (living beings). It means that we existed at one point in time and are gradually ‘becoming’ [something]. One day, we were a kana (cell). Later, we grew into babies. We were born as babies, later grew into kids. We were kids, later grew into young adults. We were young adults, later grew into old people. The person who was old leaves the body and separates. Later he became a cell. There, he grew into a baby. This is a cycle. At one place, he becomes and later he exists. Again, he becomes and exists. Wherever these ‘existing’ and ‘becoming’ life processes happen, that is called bhu:tham (living being/existence). We must remember this. The term bhu:thas (living beings) doesn’t refer to ghosts, ill-spirits etc. The entire set of living beings is called bhu:tha (living being). All are called bhu:thas (living beings).\nIf they are at a state once and then becoming, it is because of food. Food is not the same type for everyone. It is different for all beings. For a human being, rice is the food. For a wild animal, another animal is its food. For a tree - air, water and earth are the food. For an ocean, the rivers are the food. For a cloud, water on the ground is the food. Each one has something different as its food. Anything does not exist or happen without food. Therefore, Arjuna! all the bhu:thas (living beings) exist because of food.\nIn chapter 3, Sri Krishna starts with\nanna:th bhavanthi bhu:tha:ni (From food, living beings come into existence).\nHe explains the details of the underlying process. The yield from the crops and the growth of some beings with the [water from the] clouds... These become the food for bhu:thas (living beings). Clouds form because of the sun rays. Sun rays get ‘stronger’ because of yajnas (sacrifices/rituals). Karma (action/duty), work when performed in a manner becomes Yajna (sacrifice/ritual). Karma (action/duty) is done through the bodies. Bodies work only when there is a ji:va (soul) indwelling. When a ji:va (soul) and the body are together, it is called a bhu:tha (living being). These again… because of food. Food… because of clouds. Clouds… because of yajna (sacrifice/ritual). Yajna (sacrifice/ritual)… because of karma (action/duty). Karma (action/duty)… because of bodies. Bodies… because of the indwelling souls. Body and soul together is a bhu:tha (living being). This is a wheel.\nIt is essential for every living being in this kingdom of Nature to live by this wheel. It is impossible for anyone to violate this wheel. One becomes a sinner if he thinks he need not live by this wheel while living in this world. Such a person’s lifespan is used only for accruing sins. His life will be wasted on roaming in the forests of senses. Such a person’s life is a burden to the earth. Sri Krishna explains this in verse 3.16.\nArjuna got a little scared listening to this. He wanted to quit doing his karma (action/duty). Sri Krishna conveys very firmly that everyone must perform karma (action/duty) and do it as yajna (sacrifice/ritual). Arjuna however does not want to work [i.e. do karma (action/duty)]. A question raised in Arjuna’s mind when he heard one has to always continue to do work. “Is it never right to leave karma (action/duty)? Do we always continue to do karma (action/duty)?” “Earlier in chapter 2, You said jna:na (knowledge), knowledge is very important.” “You said it’s good to be in that bra:mhi stthithi (state of realization about God) at least in the end of life.”\nstthithva: asya:m anthah ka:le:pi bramha nirva:namuchyathi (Remaining in this state even at the end of life, one attains liberation in Brahman).\n“I want to become such jna:ni (knowledgeable person).” Assume that I have become such a jna:ni (knowledgeable person). “Then, I wouldn’t need karma (action/duty), right?” Arjuna asked Sri Krishna after listening to His upade:sa (teaching).\nSa:sthra (scriptures) answered this for us. Ji:vas (souls) are of three types. Not types, but in three states. All the souls are fully equal in size and qualities. They are not different from each other. However, depending on the place they are in, they are divided into three categories. One of the categories is named as nithya suris (eternal associates of God). The other category is named muktha ganas (liberated souls). The third category is named baddha ji:vas (bound souls).\nYou asked the question about not needing to do karma (action/duty) once you are a jna:ni (knowledgeable person). The state where one is a jna:ni (knowledgeable person) and thus not needing to do karma (action/duty) is… Yes, tell me who belongs to that state. I must check if I belong to that category. If it is mukthas (liberated souls) or nithyas (eternal associates), then you don’t need to. Oh, is it? I need to get to that state of mukthas (liberated souls) or nithyas (eternal associates).\nWho are these belonging to the third category? Who are the baddhas (bound souls)? Where do they span from and exist till where? From the smallest of the smallest cells in this prakruthi mandala (realm of Nature) such as amoeba as said in earlier days… Or something else if there is any, considering the viruses as discovered during these covid times… From that smallest cell spanning through all the ji:vas (souls) such as… Animals, birds, insects and worms that you see on the ground… Human beings who live seeing all these… All the de:vathas (demigods/celestial beings) that are not visible to eyes even to human beings and are thought to be the shakthi vise:shas (special powers)… Additionally, there are various categories in de:vathas (demigods/celestial beings). Gandharva, a:ja:na de:vas, karma de:vas etc… The one in the top-most state amongst all of them is called chathurmukha brahma (four-faced Brahma). There is no ji:va (soul) above him in this prakruthi mandalam (realm of Nature). All the de:vathas (demigods/celestial beings) come under this category. From Brahma to the tiniest organism… The tiniest organism is named as sthambha (immobile entity/smallest organism). It is therefore said…\nsthambha:di bramha paryantha (from the smallest organism to Brahma).\nWhatever is the smallest or biggest, all of them are called baddha ji:vas (bound souls). We are all baddha ji:vas (bound souls). Chathumukha Brahma (four-faced Brahma) is baddha ji:va (bound soul). Rudra is baddha ji:va (bound soul). Indra is baddha ji:va (bound soul). Chandra (Moon god) is baddha ji:va (bound soul). No matter what name a ji:va (soul) is known by, they are all under the category of baddha ji:vas (bound souls).\nThere could be small differences between them. When you speak about the ocean, it does not matter if it is a grain of sand or a mountain that is dropped… Both of them drown properly into the ocean. Ya:muna:cha:rya swami (Yamunacharya Swami) asks in a prayer…\nanukula: chalayo:ho ko: vise:shaha (What is the difference between a grain of sand and a mountain?)\nThink of a category called ji:va varga (category of souls). Everything comes under it. There are differences. There is a big difference between the grain of sand and the mountain. There may be differences between them but there is no difference w.r.t drowning in the ocean. They both drown equally. Similarly, one being considered the biggest called Brahma could be possessing more punya (merit/result of good deeds). Someone in the mid level such as Rudra, Indra etc could be having a different percentage of punya (merit/result of good deeds). Human beings like us could be further different in the percentage of punya (merit/result of good deeds). Yet, he is a baddha (bound soul), and we are a baddha (bound soul) too. We can therefore happily feel of him to be a sibling. We will have differences between us. Even within human beings, there are differences. There are people like us and then there are people who are the rulers of a state of the country. There are ministers, the President or Bill Gates or someone XYZ. There could be differences, small or big, between them. However, everyone drowns in the ocean of baddha ji:vas (bound souls).\nIt is essential to know what baddha ji:vas (bound souls) mean? Rest of the beings don’t know. There is a chance that humans can understand. Hence, it is taught to humans. Baddhas (bound souls) means those in a knot. What kind of knot? Baddhas (bound souls) means those who are in a tightly tied patterned strong knot called karma (accumulated impressions). We are all ‘happily’ stuck in the knot of karma (action/duty). There will be differences in the karma (action/duty), that’s okay. We are all karma baddhas (bound by karma). Any karma baddha (bound by karma) must do karma (action/duty).\nHow about mukthas (liberated souls)? They are ones who were earlier karma baddhas (bound by karma), but are now out of it. Because they have come out of the bondage, they need not work as per any karma (action/duty). How about nithyas (eternal associates)? They have never been touched by karma (action/duty). Hence, they don’t need karma (action/duty). Nithyas (eternal associates) and mukthas (liberated souls) do not need karma (action/duty). What category do you belong to? Are you currently tied with karma (action/duty)? Or are you out of it?\nWe see some sannya:sis (monks) in the world. Despite being a sannya:si (monk), because he lives here, he is bound to karma (action/duty). He has not given up karma (action/duty). So, as a sannya:si (monk), there are certain dharmas (duties) he needs to practice. There are certain demands for this Nature. Body is made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements). Each bhu:tha (element) makes demand for a certain thing. When the portion of matti (earth material) comes down, it makes a demand. That demand is named hunger. It is then we get something made from the earth and drop it inside. Similarly, when the portion of water comes down, it makes the respective demand called thirst. That is when water or some liquid with water is taken in. Then, it [thirst] is ‘satiated’. Similarly, it is common for all baddha ji:vas (bound souls) to be in control of them. One who is living with these but is not in control of them, that person does not need to do karma (action/duty). Is it possible? Is it possible to not be influenced by Nature while living in this prakruthi mandala (realm of Nature)?\nYes, if God takes a form such as Krishna, Varaha (Boar incarnation), Narasimha (Man-lion incarnation), He was not influenced by Nature. However, it wasn’t the case when He took the form as Rama. He decided to be a human being when He took the form as Rama.\na:thma:nam ma:nusham manye: (I consider myself a human being).\nHe lived as a human being because He said He will. However, when God descended as Him, He didn’t come under the influence of Nature. As Krishna, He ‘drank’ fire. He went in the water and did what He wanted to. He manifested Himself in multiple locations at the same time. He has done all of these. Living in this prakruthi mandalam (realm of Nature) and not be influenced by the Nature, i.e. Keeping the demands of the pancha bhu:thas (five elements) in their hands, i.e. in their control. Are there such people? We can see 1 or 2 of them sporadically. Let’s move forward learning who they are.\nvande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of gurus)."

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nWe begin with a prayer:\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\n(I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nTake a dip in water, but don’t get wet. Is this a wise thing to say? Take a seat on an oil-covered floor but don’t get smeared with oil. A wise one wouldn’t say this. We don’t consider such people as intelligent. If someone claims he isn’t impacted by nature whilst he is living in nature, we should feel pity for him. We shouldn’t say anything to such a person. Because if we argue with a crazy person, we don’t know if his craziness will subside but we for sure will be caught up in it! Therefore, instead of arguing with such a person, we should simply let him go, feeling pity for him.\nYes, there are certain people living in nature but are beyond any effects of it. We can recognize such people by their behavior. As far as we know, they are very rare and we can only count such people on our fingers. A little before Kali Yuga started, there was a great sage named Sri Suka Deva, son of Veda Vyas. He can be perceived to be in such a state. He had no bodily feelings. He had no interaction with the surroundings. He would carry on just like that. His father, Veda Vyas was running behind him calling out ‘Oh son…’. No response - the reason… [Suka Deva] was beyond the bodily level, united with God… since God is all-pervasive, and… Because it is not the soul who answers, [by itself] but… it is enabled by God to respond, and Being everywhere, Lord could respond from anywhere…\nBha:gavatham (Bhagavatam) states that when [Veda Vyas] called out “son”, it was the trees that responded, not [Suka Deva]. Everything in nature responded saying ‘yes..’ but the son didn’t respond. This is Sri Suka. He had no dhya:sa (focus) on food. He had no focus on water. When someone is deeply involved in some activity, they don’t think about food or water even though they need them. They don’t think about them but if someone brings them, they accept. There are some great beings like yogis (spiritual practitioners) and avadhootas (ascetics). A great soul like Jadabharatha… They don’t need anything. They don’t have any thoughts for food or water. They sit at some place worshiping the indwelling Lord. However, if someone brings food to them, they will take it. Meaning they know that food is something that can be eaten. However, they don’t focus on it. They know that water is something to be drunk, but that’s not on their mind. There are some like this. However, the Great Sage Sri Suka’s state is such that he doesn’t even need them.\nThe emperor Parikshit reaches and seeks Sri Suka during the last stage of his life. He [Parikshit] asks some questions [to Sri Suka]. He [Sri Suka] is united with God and is brahma jnani (one knowledgeable about God). What is it that one must do before leaving the body when he realizes death is inevitable and nearing? Parikshit asked this question. As a response, he [Sri Suka] taught Bha:gavatham (Bhagavatam). He taught it for 7 days. What’s interesting is that only one among the thousands in attendance attained moksha (liberation) after listening to it. Only one attained grace. Who was it? Emperor Parikshit. [Sri Suka] spoke and [Parikshit] listened. It was 7 days of uninterrupted discourse accompanied with uninterrupted listening. There were many sages in attendance, but after hearing for some time… Some would go into yogam (sleep). Some, out of pain, would get up to stretch their legs, hands or neck. Some needed to get up for their daily morning routines. Some got up taking a break to have breakfast, lunch, snack, or dinner, etc. However, Sri Suka did not move from the position he sat in until the 7th day. He wasn’t tired. During the discourse, Sri Suka, the teacher, asked the one listening, King Parikshit, if he also would like to take a break. “I am filling the cups of my ears with your preaching, taking it in. What other hunger and thirst can exist?” He responded that way. He sat there for all 7 days with the same diksha (devoted dedication), and heard the discourse, attaining ultimate grace. The others needed food, water, sleep, and to care for the body. On a long-haul flight, you are advised to get up and stretch instead of constantly watching TV. You are advised to do some exercise, i.e stretches. The rest were doing all of this, but not Parikshit. Whilst living in nature, and dwelling in the body which is a form of nature… He could live without being controlled by any bodily pressures. For such a person, there is no need to perform any karma. He can give up karma. Sri Suka is also the same way. So, it’s fine for him [to not do any karma] as well.\nThere is another person. [Sri Suka and Parikshit] are before this Kali Yuga started. Another great being took birth on the 41st day of the current Kali Yuga. He was later named Nammalwar. He is also called Satakopa. He took birth and didn’t move for 16 years. He didn’t breathe, didn’t drink water, didn’t eat food, didn’t even have his mother’s milk ever. Sitting in the tamarind tree’s trunk hole, and developing a blue complexion… He was growing up in a town named Thirunagari in South India, without wanting [anything external]. A great soul named Madhurakavi tried to wake him up using sound as his tool. Madhurakavi asked a question and was answered [by Satakopa]. Satakopa expressed everything within his heart in beautiful cadence. It was a great outpouring. Everything poured out in a wonderful flow. After a while, he fell unconscious reflecting on God’s auspicious qualities. Because… Out of many qualities, one quality is that He surrenders to the most ordinary people. He allowed Himself to be tied up to a mortar by an innocent cowherd lady. He let Himself be beaten by them. He is the great One who ties all the worlds with the rope of karma. He is the supporting root of the entire universe. Such a One allowed Himself to be tied up by one lady with a rope. She demanded that He shouldn’t move and if He did [she would punish Him]. As if He were incapable of anything… He was shivering, sobbing, rubbing His eyes, with His chest moving up and down due to the sobs. He stood there like that, crying. Thinking of this quality of God, Nammalwar couldn’t bear it. He thought about the level of greatness of that God… And how easily He becomes accessible and surrenders to the devotees who love Him. Thinking about this, Nammalwar fell unconscious for 6 months.\nUpon waking, he asked where he was. Worried that he would return to that state, they didn’t remind him of that quality. They talked about God’s other supreme qualities which help people, such as… Sowshilya (friendly nature with everyone despite being greater in every way to them). Nammalwar kept singing about those qualities. After singing for some time, he [Madhurakavi] asked if he was thirsty and would like some water. He said he was not thirsty. “What did you drink that you don’t feel thirsty?” “Where is the room for thirst when I am drinking the waters of God’s auspicious qualities?” For those like Ramadasu, there was no need to drink water. He sang, “Oh Rama, what an amazingly delicious name is Rama…what a great taste!” That itself became the desirable taste for him. If we sing, we end up desiring many tastes from outside because the inside gets dried up! That’s because we are dependent and controlled by them. They are not living in control of these. “Will you at least eat something?” “I feel satiated, there is no hunger.” “What did you eat?” “Thoughts about the various cheshta (activities), God’s avataras (incarnations), during all the avataras (appearances)…” “The stomach became full.” Does our stomach get filled up that way? No. “How about a couple of chocolates or ice-creams? Will you have something like that?” “Nothing else gives me happiness when thinking of God’s avataras (incarnations) and his divine activities.” “I do not need anything else.” He lived in nature, i.e. the body for 32 years. For 16 [of the 32], he was in yogam (deep meditative state). After he woke up, he lived for 16 years singing His qualities he experienced within. He did not depend on the water from nature even for a moment. Did not depend on the food or air. Meaning he was not under the control of nature. In this way, if anyone is capable of… living in this nature not controlled by it, not affected by it, or influenced by it… Then, such a person need not perform any karma. Why? Because… There is nothing that he needs to attain nor nothing to lose by performing or not performing karma…\nWhat about us? If we do not perform karma, our body will become stiff. Check a hand that is released after being in a cast for a month. It becomes tough to clench immediately afterward. We can all understand this practically. Sit tight for 1 hour. It will take some time to stretch and put it in order after the hour. We are living beings dependent on it. We are having to live in control of it. For them, it is in their control. Therefore, there is no loss if they do or don’t perform karma. Because there is neither of those [loss or gain], there is no need to depend on karma. For such people, there is no need to practise karma. “What happened to you?” “Isn’t it necessary for you?” “You cannot skip doing karma. You must perform karma.” “Therefore, whatever is appropriate for you…” “Such as killing your enemies, eliminating wrong-doings, putting out wrong-doers.” “It is your responsibility. Therefore, you cannot give up.” Arjuna’s plan was to somehow escape this war. “There is no way out of it. You must fight. You must abide by your responsibility.” This is the essence of Sri Krishna’s message. That is why, He elucidated the wonderful wheel in chapter 3. Explaining that we must lead life through it, He explains in 2 beautiful verses that there are certain ones who can skip [karma]. Those are verses 17 and 18. Let’s enter them.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the entire world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna advises Arjuna on his responsibility as a means to instruct us on the best way to live life. Every word the Lord speaks and every instruction He gives is highly meaningful and useful to our life.\nSome poets use some words to complete a verse. Examples are thu (and), cha (and), va (or), hai (indeed), sma (indeed). Those words don’t have any valuable meaning. If the verse needs 8 syllables and his text has 7, he adds thu (and) or cha (and) to make it complete. Then, the verse aligns with prosody. There is no harm or loss to the meaning. They are added solely for the sake of only completing a line of poetry. While speaking, some people use words such as ‘did you know…?’ There are certain words that some people are habituated to while speaking. They can’t speak without using those words.\nSri Krishna never added anything extra simply to complete lines. Every letter He used is meaningful…every word. If we know this, we can properly understand His heart. Otherwise, we might conclude that certain parts of text are not useful. If He used thu (and) or something else, there is an intended meaning for it. Our elders say that Valmiki Bhagavan (Lord Valmiki) also composed Ramayana in the same way. If he has used thu (and) somewhere, there is definitely great depth to its meaning. If we observe properly, we will know.\nBhagavad Ramanujacharya Swami is the mahaniya (great soul) who observed Sri Krishna’s heart properly. There are many who gave commentaries on Bhagavad Gita. However, to understand it from the beginning to end without changing the context, and being able to practice it properly, it is given by the mahaniya (great soul) Bhagavad Ramanujacharya Swami. His inspiration came from the mahaniya (great soul) Yamunacharya Swami before him, who set the foundation by composing Gitaartha Sangraha (Summary of the Gita's meaning). Ramanujacharya Swami followed it properly and gave us the summary, verse by verse.\nThere is one specific verse in it. Not just one verse, we discussed all verses. We discussed this when the wheel was mentioned earlier. A wheel indicates a circle and therefore the ending should land at the starting point. Others did not provide this. Others started at one point and went straight into another direction. How will that translate to a wheel? We discussed earlier about how that translates to a wheel, no need to reiterate now.\nVerse 17 discusses who does not need to perform karma (action). We should observe the words properly.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyasthv a:thmarathir e:va sya:th a:thma thrupthas cha ma:navaha |\na:thmanye:va cha santhushtas thasya ka:ryam na vidyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who finds delight in the self, who is satisfied by the self, and who is fully content within the self, for him there is no duty to perform.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is not referring only to Arjuna. ma:navaha (human being). It isn’t about a male, female, child, youth, or elder. He doesn’t leave anyone out of the scope. Whoever it is, has to be of either of the two types. One is karma nishta (devoted to action) and the other is jnana nishta (devoted to knowledge).\nOne who is karma nishta (devoted to action) keeps carrying out activities as his responsibilities without reflecting much on jnana (knowledge). One who is jnana nishta (devoted to knowledge) works with love knowing who he is, why he is doing it. For example, let’s say that an employee is a karma nishta (devoted to action). Many people say that they are karma yogis (practitioners of action yoga). We lead life by working. The word is a good one, but its usage isn’t right. A karma nishta (devoted to action) is one who claims “this is my duty,” working like an ox pulling a cart. He keeps working while crying about it. He may or may not cry outside. However, he continues to simply go on working. This is one type of karma nishta (devoted to action).\nJnana nishta (devoted to knowledge) is one who also works. However, like a mother who works with so much love for the child, or a husband who serves his wife with so much love (it’s natural for a wife to serve her husband with love, but here it’s like the love of a husband serving his wife), or the amount of devotion and dedication that a disciple has when serving his guru (spiritual teacher), it is the same work. This person does more than what one is normally expected to. He doesn’t need rest, despite breaking a sweat, having worked so hard. He does it happily. He enjoys every second of the work. He relishes the services. This happens when one has jnana (knowledge). He is called jnana yogi (practitioner of knowledge yoga).\nBoth of them have a purpose. What is the purpose? It is to satisfy the person at the receiving end. If a mother works, it is for the happiness of the child. If a disciple works, it is for the happiness of the guru (spiritual teacher). If a worker does something, it is for the happiness of the owner. He does it yearning for the happiness of the other, with love for him. The leaders of a party also work in the same way, though embedded with a bit of self-interest. The party workers desire to be appointed to a post if they work hard. Such desire does not exist in a mother, father, disciple, or a friend, etc. With a politician, there may be a desire to earn a position. There is service with a desire for some benefit. What we talked about earlier is the one with a desire to see happiness in the recipient. In this case, there is underlying knowledge of the relation between the two. Because this knowledge dominates, there is satisfaction in the service he does.\nWho is Sri Krishna talking about in Bhagavad Gita? The one who wants to know about himself, referred to as atma darsana kankshi (seeker of self-perception), or atma sakshatkara kankshi (seeker of self-realization). If we use these terms, it feels heavy on the head. Simply put, it is one who wants to know about the self. We must also understand it though. Atma Darsanam (self-perception) is the goal for everything we do using the body. I am so and so. I am not a body. The caste that the body acquired is not mine. The race that came with the body is not mine. The color that the body has is not mine. The weight or anything else that the body got is not mine. I am beyond all of these. I do not belong to the body or to the relations of the body. I belong to Bhagavan (God). My state is that of being related to God. This is called jnana (knowledge). As this knowledge is solidified, it is called yogam (union/discipline). That is called jnana yoga (yoga of knowledge). This is called karma yoga (yoga of action).\nKarma Yoga nishta (devoted to the yoga of action) is a type of sadhak (spiritual practitioner). Jnana Yoga nishta (devoted to the yoga of knowledge) is another type of sadhak (spiritual practitioner). These are the two types of people in the world. What about bhakti yoga nishtas (devoted to the yoga of devotion)? Yes. How about prapatthi yoga nishtas (devoted to the yoga of surrender)? Yes. They also can be categorized into the section of jnana yoga nishtas (devoted to the yoga of knowledge). They are just subdivisions of this. The ripened state of jnana (knowledge) is called bhakti (devotion). When bhakti (devotion) blooms into the state of surrender, it is termed prapatthi (surrender). Because they are all different states of jnana (knowledge), we must remember the two: Karma nishta (devoted to action) and jnana nishta (devoted to knowledge). These two are the means. What we attain with either of them is Atma Darsanam (self-realization). If one attains this, he will happily carry out his responsibilities. He will become kriyashila (an active doer). Otherwise, he will become nishkriya (inactive/a deserter). Arjuna is desiring to become a deserter. “Throughout life, you must never become a deserter.” This is what Sri Krishna instructs. That is why He began [verse 17] with… yasthu (one who)… has already attained self-realization need not do any karma (action).\nWho is that who attained it? What would that person be like? One who attained it has no need for anything else. If someone has eaten in full, offering a snack or dessert like gulab jamun, jhangri, jilebi, he would decline at least for that moment. Though he may want it later, he won’t need it at the moment offered. The one who already has self-realization, he would not have any rathi (liking/attachment) towards anything else. He wouldn’t need to attain any satisfaction or joy with anything else. Note that he does not need them. It’s not about not having the desire. Why? Because he has what is supposed to be had.\nAssume someone has to travel from one place to a neighboring one. How does he go? Either by foot, cycle, bike, rikshaw, car, or flight. He has to use something. Assuming he owns a car without any issues, what efforts does he need to put in for the car? Why would he desire to attain a car then? If he doesn’t have a car and someone offers a car to him, he would be relieved and satisfied with it. If he has a car for himself, he wouldn’t attain any satisfaction from, desire for, or think about other cars. Because he already possesses a car.\nLet’s say someone is looking for a place to live. What does he need? He needs a house. If someone already has built him a 10-star rated building, why would he have any interest in the design or architecture of the building, or the respective engineers? Not necessary, right? He would need them and the efforts if he wants to construct a house and he has the necessary money for it. If he’s already been given a building that cannot be constructed further, why would he have any liking towards anything else? Or, assume someone shows him a small hut, or a small tiled-roof house, or a one-floor home. He would not attain fulfillment from these when he already owns a big nice building. He wouldn’t need any satisfaction that he gets from being in those. He has rathi (liking/attachment), trupti (satisfaction), santushti (full satisfaction) because what he needs is already with him.\nTake a person who is hungry. Give him a plate full of twenty-five hot and appealing dishes and tell him all of them are for him. Will he need to think about earning something, or where the stove is, or lentils, grains, vegetables, salt, helpers, etc.? Will he have any interest in all of those? If one has attained the desirable goal, he would not have any interest or satisfaction with anything else. Similarly, one who does not need any special efforts because he has already attained self-realization, that person does not need it (karma/action). Let him be a karma yogi (practitioner of action yoga) or jnana yogi (practitioner of knowledge yoga). For such a person, there is no need to perform karma (action).\nThere are others who lived prior to Ramanujacharya who gave commentaries on Gita. When they were explaining yaha (who), they did not understand it to mean the one who already has attained karma jnana yoga (yoga of action and knowledge). They thought it to mean the one who abstained from karma (action), having acquired atma jnana (knowledge of the self). They thought it is only they who need not perform karma (action). What they said was whoever is a sannyasi (renounced one) need not perform karma (action). However, they forgot one aspect: naishkarmyam achareth (one should perform action without attachment). They forgot that even a sannyasi (renounced one) has some dharmas (prescribed duties) to practice. sarvato vitha trushnaha sannyasi (a sannyasi who is free from all desires). He also must perform. The clause tasya karyo na vidyate (for him there is no duty) does not apply to him. Therefore, others have given meanings for Sri Krishna’s words and sentences but explaining the meaning requires the knowledge of context too. It is also necessary to observe the background. This is what Bhagavad Ramanujacharya’s Gita Bhashya (commentary on the Gita) so clearly, beautifully, and properly reflects.\nSri Krishna also says another thing about this person [who has no need to perform karma (action)]. naiva tasya kruthenarthaha (for him there is no purpose in action).\nVande guruparamparam (I bow to the lineage of gurus).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

If offered the pulpy fibrous remains from a squeezed sugarcane, what will one do? Would he relish it? No. He won’t even look at it. Why? Because if he desires to eat, there are delicious dishes accessible to him. There are dishes that satisfy him. There are dishes that give him joy. Because such dishes are available, he won’t even think of the residue of squeezed sugarcane.\nSimilarly… For one who knows who he is, i.e., who is an atma darsi (one who sees the soul), has clarity on who he is… Because he doesn’t need to attain anything else or achieve any other purpose… For such a person… `thasya ka:ryam na vidyathe:` (there is no duty for him).\nIn verse 3.17, Sri Krishna clarifies to Arjuna that no one is exempt from performing karma (action). No one living in this world can abandon karma (action). Who is eligible to abandon karma (action)? Only one who has nothing to gain from karma (action). If that person has something that outweighs his loss from abandoning karma (action)… Then, he does not need karma (action).\n“It’s not the case with you. You are wishing that you stay happy with all your relatives.” Relatives are those who are related through the body. Bodies are made of pancha bhutas (five elements of nature). All of them including Drona, Bhishma or anyone else are made of pancha bhutas (five elements of nature). Thus, you are under the control of the five elements in nature. You are desiring to be with them. You think you will experience distress if you hurt them. You think that you will be happy when you are with them. You think that you will have satisfaction when they are with you. If any of them are hurt, you say…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npathanthi pitharo:hye:sha:m luptha pindo:daka kriya:ha\nnarako:ni:tham va:sobhavathi:thi anususruma\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTheir ancestors fall (from heaven), deprived of the offerings of food and water. We have heard that such people dwell in hell.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThat’s in chapter 1. You spoke in detail about hell, heaven, pleasing one’s ancestors, and making offerings to them. You don’t have atma rathi (joy from self-knowledge), atma thrupthi (satisfaction with self-knowledge), and atma santhushti (contentment with self-knowledge). In this case, because you have given into elements of nature, you must work according to them.\nSome feel themselves as sannyasi (one who renounces), who leave everything unto God. However, they also need something at every mealtime. If not at every mealtime, they want something at every other mealtime. If not every other mealtime, some need once in every two days. If not once every two days, some might need it once every year. In summary, there must be something at some point supporting it [body]. Also, they think about meeting with other people in the world. They conduct some sessions with others. They also have wealth through donations, etc. They live along with them. They also speak with leaders, politicians, etc. They think of what’s good and bad, etc. Meaning they are also living with the desire for what’s made with bhutas (elements) only. Maybe not fully but it exists to some level. Because they are wishing for some purpose with these, they must behave in accordance with them.\nIf there is no purpose at all… `naiva thasya kruthe:na:rtthaha` (he has no purpose in what is done). `kruthe:na` (if one works on something). He doesn’t need the result of it despite doing that task. He has the body, needs to put it to work, and it is working. There is some result from it but he is not connected to it. `na akruthe:na kaschana artthaha` (nor does he have any purpose in what is not done). If he does not perform the task, he won't get any result. However, he does not incur any loss due to that. He is not awaiting it anyway. Why? Because he has already attained whatever has to be attained. There is nothing new that he needs to attain or nothing that he will lose. Not just from one space or place.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna cha asya sarvabhu:the:shu\nkaschidarttha vyapa:srayaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNor does he depend on any being for any purpose.\n-----------------------------------------------\nRamanujacharya Swami gives wonderful commentary for this too. `sarva bhu:the:shu kaschidarttha vya:pa…` `sarva bhu:the:shu` (among all beings). Sri Krishna gives the meaning to this word as the world you are living in. The world is made of pancha bhutas (five elements). No matter who it is, everyone is panchabhutatmik (made of five elements of nature). It is for the purpose of enjoying these that we desire to do something with our sense organs. Body desires good touches. Eye wants to see good shapes. Ear wants to hear nice tunes. Tongue wants to taste delicious things. Nose wants to smell good fragrances. Each sense organ has a desire. Sabda (sound), sparsa (touch), rupa (shape), rasa (taste), gandha (fragrance). All these came from pancha bhutas (five elements). Earth emits smells. Water gives taste. Fire gives color. Air gives touch. Space gives sound. So, these come from pancha bhutas (five elements). `kaschidarttha vyapa:srayaha sarvabhu:the:shu` (he has nothing to gain from any of these pancha bhutas). This is what Ramanujacharya Swami said.\nHowever, those prior to Ramanujacharya Swami said… “Ranging from Brahma to a pillar, this person does not need to get anything from anyone.” “Hence, he can leave everyone and go to a forest.” Going to the forest might mean building a family there. Didn’t sage Vishwamitra go to the forests leaving his home? Didn’t another family rise there too? All the commentators prior to Ramanujacharya opined that… it meant to abandon people and the relations with people. However, Ramanujacharya clarified… `sarva bhu:the:shu` (among all beings) means all the five elements. There is nothing that this person… needs to attain from any of the pancha bhutas (five elements) or from whatever is made out of them. Atma tattva (reality of soul) is a tattva (reality) that is beyond those [pancha bhutas]. He is already in unison with the reality of soul. He has already attained it. He was told to do any work only to give him the means to attain self-realization. That’s what was said. Since he has already attained it, it does not matter what he gets or doesn’t while performing any work. There is no use for him with any of the two. This is true for that kind of a person.\nAre you that kind of a person? Those in Paramapadam (eternal abode of God), known as Nithyas (who never left God) and mukthas (who returned to God) are of that kind. They are not desiring anything from pancha bhutas (five elements). They take a form using only the knowledge of soul and… `sathatha parye:thi jakshan kri:dan ramama:naha` (always moves about, eating, playing, and enjoying). They do services that are of jnana (knowledge). Not feeling satisfied with that, he molds nature over there to a suitable form he desires. `sa e:kadha: bhathi thridha: bhavathi panchadha: sapthadha: navadha: punascha e:ka:dasa smurthasyathancha dasacha, e:kascha: sahasra:ni cha` (He becomes one, he becomes three, he becomes five, seven, nine, and again eleven, a hundred, a thousand). Upanishad states that they take multiple forms for offering service to God. The focus there is on serving God. Not for the service done with a body [made of pancha bhutas]. There is no connectivity to anything related to the body. For such a person…yes!\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnaiva thasya kruthe:na:rtthaha na akruthe:na iha kaschana\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe has no purpose in what is done, nor does he have any purpose in what is not done in this world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt does not matter where he is. There is nothing he will lose from not doing any work. There is nothing he hopes to gain from doing any work. Someone who gained many degrees in education like Ph.Ds, etc… When he is teaching a small kid how to write his first letter, He starts writing at the proper position and turns in the proper direction and completes it. He does it carefully so as to teach it to the kid. He is so learned that no matter what he does, it becomes a patented version. He is so great that whatever he writes becomes something meaningful. For such a person, there is no gain from writing or loss by not writing. For such a person, there is no loss if he does not do anything. However, Arjuna! You cannot be that way. Since you are one who is bound by the wheel of life, you must continue to perform all appropriate activities in the journey of life. You cannot abandon karma yoga (path of action) or give up performing karma (action).\nSri Krishna clarifies this in chapter 3, verse 19. `thasma:th` (therefore), because we are still bound by karma (action). Despite being in jnana yoga (path of knowledge) or karma yoga (path of action), it is karma yoga (path of action) that is the best until you are here [in this world]. Meaning karma yoga (path of action) is the best even for one who is eligible for jnana yoga (path of knowledge).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:d asakthas sathatham\nka:ryam karma sama:chara\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, always perform your duty without attachment.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou must perform karma (action) properly. Who should be told to perform karma (action)? We don’t need to tell that to one who is performing karma (action). Even for a karma yogi (one who practices karma yoga) as well, karma yoga (path of action) is suitable and easy. Like water that flows into the lowlands. Therefore, you also [perform karma (action)]… `asakthaha` (no connection). Don’t build any bond with the work, but do it. If you bond with it, you will feel proud when it becomes successful. You will want to show off. If it fails, you will feel depressed thinking about how it all happened. It does not stop with one day, it goes on throughout life. Some people when angry say that they will even take many lives to take revenge. Instead of desiring for no second birth, he desires multiple lives. He is a dhirgha sutri (one who ties himself long-term to something). Both favorable and adverse responses continue to tag along with him for a continued period of time. This shouldn’t be the way. What is Sri Krishna saying? Don’t abandon performing work but abandon the continued attachment with it. `asakthaha` (remain unbound). Saktha (to bind) means to bind. Asaktha (to not bind) means to not bind. `sathatham` (always). Despite being a karma yogi (one who practices karma yoga), or having the right for jnana yoga (path of knowledge), or attaining self-realization… As long as you are in this world, performing your duty is the right thing to do. He [Krishna] is also doing it. Because if He does not do it… Similar to how if a teacher is not sitting in the right posture while writing… The student follows the same. If the teacher writes upside down, the student thinks that’s the right way. When you bow to elders and God, your child will watch you do it and learn the same. If you do it wrong, he will also do it wrong. Therefore, you must do it right for the sake of the child’s well-being. `asakthas sathatham ka:ryam karma` (always perform your duty without attachment). With determined knowledge that this is what and how it must be done… `sama:chara` (perform it properly). But doesn’t performing bind me? No, it doesn’t.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nasaktho:hy a:charan karma\nparam a:pnothi pu:rushaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFor by performing action without attachment, a person attains the Supreme.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen you perform it with no attachment… `param a:pno:thi` (attains the Supreme). You will attain atma darsana (self-realization), that is pre-eminent and permanent… compared to temporary worldly benefits. I.e. You will attain proper knowledge of who you are. That is when anything you do will not tie you up. You will perform karma (action), but it will not bind you. He later clarifies, giving the example of a lotus leaf in a pond. It lives in water but it stays untouched. Similarly… You will live amidst all these, doing all the work, but you will be able to do them untouched. In chapter 3, Sri Krishna thus clarifies the essence of the process followed in karma yoga (path of action). He is taking Arjuna forward explaining this beautifully in verses 3.17, 3.18 and 3.19. Let us also gradually move forward.\nVande guruparamparam (I bow to the lineage of gurus).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBhagavad Gita’s 18 chapters are categorized into three shatkas (sections of six). The first set of 6 chapters is called atma shatka (section on the soul). The second set of 6 chapters is called bhakti shatka (section on devotion). The third set of 6 chapters is called purva sesha (remaining part).\nIn the first 6 chapters, the question \"Who are you?\" is addressed, and that 'you' is called atma (soul). The main goal of the first 6 chapters is to elaborate on the soul. We must properly utilize human birth for the purpose of knowing this. There are certain aspects in this section, and each chapter explains a specific aspect.\nThe second chapter teaches: Know that you and the body are different from each other.\nThe third chapter teaches: As long as you are in the body, do what is recommended.\nThe fourth chapter teaches: Perform karma (action/duty) supported by the knowledge of who you are and why you are given the body. The goal of the fourth chapter is to enlighten one with that knowledge.\nAfter this, the fifth chapter teaches: Perform karma (action/duty) knowing you're not the one responsible for it. This is another chapter.\nThe sixth chapter teaches: What are the means one should use to perform such knowledge-supported karma (action/duty)? This is another chapter.\nThese are the five chapters. The first chapter describes Arjuna’s sorrow and its preface. So, these are the first 6 chapters. The summary of these 6 chapters of Bhagavad Gita is: Being born as a human, for as long as you are in the body, you should keep doing what is appropriate. This is the summary.\nWhy should you do so? Because you took human birth. We can divide what we see in the world into three categories. One is human beings, who have knowledge. Second is the rest of the living organisms. Third is the inanimate matter. Let’s divide it into three kinds this way. Keep human beings aside. The rest of the living organisms, moving and non-moving, are always working. All the substances with no life also ‘work’.\nThe living organisms are either jangamas (moving beings) or sthavaras (non-moving beings). Trees, creepers, shrubs, etc., are examples of sthavaras. All beings – from the microorganisms to everything else, except human beings – are examples of jangamas. All of them come under moving beings called jangamas. Be it sthavaras or jangamas, they live in a certain way. There are others that have no life, but they work, meaning they serve their intended purpose.\nHuman beings are one among these three. In these categories, it’s only for human beings that there is a need to teach. Why? God or nature provided human beings with good knowledge. Because of that ‘increased’ level of knowledge, humans tend to escape from duties. Therefore, there is a need to enlighten humans about their duties and make them abide by them.\nLet’s look at other beings in nature. Honey bees go around, gather nectar from flowers, and store it in their hives. Honey is then extracted primarily by humans, as well as other beings like bears. However, a honey bee never attempts to fight with others to keep what it makes. It doesn’t think about how it is putting in so much effort to collect all the honey. It doesn’t impose karthruthva (doership) on itself. It doesn’t build any hope for owning the phala (fruit/result) of its work. It doesn’t have any sanga (attachment to the process), thinking that all this is happening because of it. Meaning, honey bees work without any phala-sanga-karthruthva (attachment to results, attachment to the process, and doership). They keep collecting and storing, irrespective of whether they or someone else takes what they collected. They continue to collect and store.\nLook at the rest of the beings. Cows, for example. They graze, have water, roam around, stand still when tied up, yield milk, etc. They don’t demand care from farmers because they are providing them with plentiful milk. They don’t ask for a quota from all the milk. It doesn’t stop working. It continues to serve its purpose. It doesn’t think of itself as the doer. It doesn’t think of itself as the reason for the farmer’s livelihood. It doesn’t consider what the purpose is for itself.\nBirds. They fly happily. They look for seeds to eat. They excrete some seeds, giving rise to many varieties of trees, large-sized ones, and forests as well. These forests are part of the water cycle, giving rain. Living beings are able to get life-sustaining oxygen to breathe and are able to live. Who is the reason for all this? Birds. However, they don’t ever think that they are doing such a great activity. They don’t ever think that they are the reason for the growth of all the forests. They don’t look for any benefit from the living beings who are living thanks to them. These are not simply mundane activities, yet, this is the case with any living being.\nNow, let’s look at sthavaras (living beings like trees). They give flowers, fruits, breathable air, and take in unwanted air from us, keeping nature in balance. That is why we are able to live. Yet, trees are never arrogant. They do not expect anything. They do not feel that all this is because of them. We can observe this with other sthavara beings in nature. There are other sthavaras in which we do not have the ability to perceive life – mountains, rivers, valleys, etc. Rivers flow, without which, we can’t survive. However, they don’t feel that they are the ones giving water to us. They don’t feel that they are the reason for the growth of all the plantations on the earth. They don’t ever think about what they get out of all that they do. However, they don’t rest even for a second throughout their existence. They continue to work. This is what we see with sthavaras. May it be mountains, hills, or anything else. All these are ‘working’. Whatever the prescribed duty is for them, they are doing that properly. However, they don’t expect anything out of that. They don’t have any attachment. They don’t impose doership (karthruthva) on themselves. They are helping other living beings as a result of what they do.\nOnly human beings! Claiming all the credit for the smallest of activities! In fact, they do nothing except spoil everything else. Man imposes doership (karthruthva) on himself. He poses as if everything would cease to exist if it weren’t for him. He wants to know what he gets out of whatever he is doing. Even when it comes to paying obeisances to God, he questions the reason. If he gets some prasada (sacred offering), he will pay “respects”. Or if he gets at least a feeling that his desires will be fulfilled, he will pay “respects”. This is what is surprising about human beings.\nHuman beings have lost the etiquette of working without phala-sanga-karthruthva (attachment to results, attachment to the process, and doership) because of the “knowledge” one has “gained”. All other beings are lucky as they were not given this type of knowledge. They are living happily. Nature blossoms because of them, and they in turn are happy with nature. However, because human beings are holding on to the three (phala, sanga, karthruthva), they are falling and also pulling nature down along with them. We must consider how dangerous the human race is. Not everyone will listen. It must be told to at least those who want to listen.\nLord Sri Krishna found one and only one Arjuna. That is why, He sat him down and explained that one must continue with prescribed duty. What is the activity prescribed to him? To fight in the war. An opportunity or right to suppress and curb those evil forces who oppose righteous practices. That day, it took the form of a war, Bharata sangramam (the great war of Bharata), approximately 5000 years ago. He got the opportunity to exercise that right. “Hence, perform that activity.” Instead, don’t wonder, “Why should I do it? How far should I go?” “What happens if I do it? What will happen to all of them?” “All those people may die? What will happen to these people?” Why think of all these? Does a honey bee wonder if the flower will be spoiled because it is collecting a drop of nectar from it? It does not think like that. That won’t spoil the flower anyway. It cooperates with the flower. It supports the blossoming of the species of flowers. So, everything in nature is continuing to exist due to interdependence. Why are you forgetting your responsibility?\nIn chapter 3, He clarifies this topic to Arjuna. Don’t impose phala-sanga-karthruthva (attachment to results, attachment to the process, and doership) on yourself. Become asaktha (one without attachment). Sakthi (attachment) means attachment. Put the attachment aside, i.e., become an asaktha.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntasmād asaktaḥ satataṁ kāryaṁ karma samācara\nasakto hy ācaran karma param āpnoti pūruṣaḥ\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, always perform your prescribed duty without attachment, for by performing action without attachment, a person attains the Supreme.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"Karyam karma (this is what I should be doing).\" There is no other way. For how long? \"Satatam (continuously, until the last breath).\" There is no escape from karma (action/duty). \"Karyam karma samachara (perform your prescribed duty).\" What happens if one performs this way? Here too, one looks for the result! \"Asakto hy acharan karma param apnoti purushaha (When he works with that kind of detachment, a person attains the Supreme).\" One will attain the best result, instead of worldly benefits. One will attain the result that is permanent. What one currently experiences is all temporary. They come and go. However, if one does activities supported by knowledge, param apnothi (one attains the highest). One will attain a better and permanent result. Who is this for? Purushaha (the person/human being). It is not necessary to instruct this to any other living beings. It becomes necessary to tell you. Therefore, do this properly. Saying so, Sri Krishna motivates Arjuna in verse 3.19 and takes him forward. Let us also move forward. Vande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers). Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nPeople are of two types: Karma yo:gis (those who perform actions) and Jna:na yo:gis (those who seek knowledge). Karma yo:gis are those who are always focused on fulfilling their duties. They continuously carry on with their duties believing that it is the right thing to do. A Jna:na yo:gi is one whose primary focus is not work, but highly focused on realizing his swaru:pa (true nature). He is focused on sa:dhana (spiritual practice) for realizing his swaru:pa. Such a person is called a Jna:na yo:gi. His swaru:pa (true nature) is to be desirous of a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization). The term self-realization sounds heavy. What can we do? The term gives that feeling. It’s okay. We can use it because we got used to it now. Some desire a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization). It is referred to as self-realization. Some are of this type. There are others who think they must be doing some kind of activity.\nIn Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, Sri Krishna says, “Don’t think that only those who are Karma yo:gis have the need to perform their duties.” Even for one who has the right to be called a Jna:na yo:gi, the best thing is to keep working. In fact, it is not necessary to instruct a Karma yo:gi to do his work. Who needs the instruction? Even those with the right and the eligibility to be a Jna:na yo:gi are benefited by karma yo:ga (the path of action). “The same [karma yo:ga] is good for you too.” It becomes necessary to instruct this [to Jna:na yo:gis]. God delivers this message to Arjuna in chapter 3. Because Arjuna has the urge to transform and be a Jna:na yo:gi at any cost. [He feels] “Therefore, I don’t need karma (action).” Karma (action) here refers to the war that he is currently faced with. [He feels that] it would be good to abandon this and become a Jna:na yo:gi. That is why he asked what a sthitha prajna (one with unwavering knowledge) is like. He wondered if he could fit in there somewhere. If he could fit in anywhere there, it would be his excuse to give up war and settle down in a forest. That knowledge affirms that it is appropriate for him as well to perform karma (action). Despite having the eligibility to be a Jna:na yo:gi, karma yo:ga (the path of action) is still the best way forward. That’s the purpose.\nHow long should one keep ‘working’? He explains the answer in verse 3.19.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsathatham karma sama:chara\nasakthaha thasma:th sathatham karma sama:chara\nSLOKA MEANING -\nContinue to work. You must keep working until your last breath.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna says, “Continue to work. You must keep working until your last breath.” Arjuna asks, “Can I not be a Jna:na yo:gi? What objection do you have to that?” Even for a Jna:na yo:gi, performing duty is the best way. Why? There are three reasons for that.\nFirst one: To perform work appropriate to one’s abilities is prescribed, not forbidden. This is reason number one. If something is forbidden, it’s not necessary to do it. No one can even enforce it. Therefore, the first reason is that if something is not forbidden and you don’t lose anything doing it, then do it. For a doctor holding a knife, cutting and sewing with it is not forbidden. If you say you are more skilled than the doctor and try it even for treating a patient, you will be jailed. However, it is not a forbidden act for a doctor. It is a permitted karma (action). Therefore you must do it.\nSecond reason: Doing something out of desire, is a sin. It is called ka:myam (an act driven by desire). What you are doing is not a ka:mya karma (desire-driven action). We talked about types of karmas (actions) earlier: nithya karma (daily routine actions), naimitthika karma (occasional actions), ka:mya karma (desire-driven actions), nishiddha karma (forbidden actions). Four types of karma (actions). Nithya karmas (daily routine actions) are those done as part of daily routines. Waking up, taking a bath, eating, going around, sleeping, etc. These are all nithya karmas (daily routine actions). Some are done because of a nimittha (specific cause). Perhaps you had to climb a mountain. It is not a nithya karma (daily routine action). It is naimitthika (an act driven by a cause). You had some work to do and so you had to climb up. You came down later. This is naimitthika (occasional). Ka:mya karma (desire-driven action): You felt like taking a swim, looked up a pool, paid for it, had a swim, and came back. This is ka:mya karma (desire-driven action). There is a bathroom in one’s house. There is water. He can take a bath there. However, he wanted to do something for fun and so he went for a swim. This is called ka:mya (an act driven by a desire). Nithya karma (daily routine actions), naimitthika karma (occasional actions), and ka:mya karma (desire-driven actions) – Nishiddha karma (a forbidden act): You go to a graveyard and take a walk there because you have some time to spare. That is nishiddha karma (forbidden action). You shouldn’t go. You can go if there is a need. It is not a place to go to all the time. This is nishiddha (forbidden). Oh Arjuna! To fight in the war is not a nishiddha karma (forbidden action). It is a vidhi vihitha karma (an ordained responsibility) for you. Therefore, it is not a sin. It is not ka:mya (desire-driven). So, it is not a sin for you.\nThird reason: It is recommended that you must happily work.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkurvanne:ve:ha karma:ni jijivishe:th sathagam sama:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne should desire to live for a hundred years by performing actions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nVeda itself says so! kurvanne:va (by performing actions). Also, there is e:va (only/indeed) added to it as well. Meaning you must continue to work. You cannot give up karma (action) at any time. Hence, karma a:charana (performing work) is an instruction of God. Because of these three reasons, one cannot abandon doing his work. For how long did we say he must be performing karma (action)? sathatham (throughout life). So, if you do what’s fit for you, param a:pno:thi (you will attain the highest benefit). You will attain better benefit than what others would get. So, do it. Sri Krishna instructs in chapter 3, verse 19.\nIf we are doing something, we can check precedence to see what others did. What did the Wise do when they encountered a similar situation? We should know this. What did great previous Elders do? In verse 3.20, Sri Krishna shows this to Arjuna as a prama:na (means to knowledge/evidence).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarmana iva hi samsiddhim a:stthitha: janaka:dayaha |\nlo:ka sangraham e:va:pi sampasyan karthum arhasi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIndeed, Janaka and others attained perfection only through action. You should also perform action, keeping in mind the welfare of the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe emperor Janaka… Everyone in that dynasty is called Janakas. We know of one Janaka who is the father of mother Sita. He is Janaka but it seems this Janaka is like a family name. Everyone has the name Janaka and a first name. Example: Mehta. All the family has the name Mehta. One is Ram Mehta and another is Krishna Mehta and some other Mehta, etc. Janaka is such a shared name in their family. Scriptures reveal a name called Si:radhwaja for the Janaka who is the father of mother Sita. He is thus Si:radhwaja Janaka. There is another ancestor in the family, Hrasvaro:ma. He is emperor Hrasvaro:ma Janaka. So, they are all Janakas. Krishna says janaka:dayaha (Janaka and others). Not just [Si:radhwaja] Janaka but there are many others in a similar state. They are not ordinary beings. They are all ripened in knowledge. They have a firm state of mind with proper knowledge. They are Jna:na yo:gis (those who seek knowledge). Despite being Jna:na yo:gis (those who seek knowledge), karmana iva hi samsiddhim a:stthitha:ha (they all attained self-realization only through karma a:charana (doing their work)).\nLet’s assume self-realization is the goal. There are two paths to that goal. One is karma a:charana (performing actions) leading to self-realization. Another is jna:na a:charana (practicing knowledge) leading to self-realization. Here, there is the path where one gains knowledge through karma (action) and attains self-realization. Veda stated another path where one need not gain knowledge with karma (action) but attain self-realization directly from karma (action). God is instructing this to be the appropriate path. Why? We looked at the reasons earlier. One is that it is easier for all beings with a body to exercise karma (action). So, it is sukaram (an easy thing to do). It is something one is habituated to do. It is vihitha (permitted). It is not nishiddha (forbidden). It is not sinful. It does not make you accrue or incur any sins. It is also God’s instruction. There is jna:na (knowledge) as well but as long as you are in the body, despite holding onto jna:na (knowledge), you can’t avoid some bodily activities. Right? There are very few great souls like Sri Suka and Namma:lwa:r who didn’t think of it as necessary. Others won’t have such a state. So, they should keep performing norms with respect to the body. They should keep offering the body what it needs. Therefore, in the path of jna:na (knowledge), there is a chance of downfall trying to take control of the body through various ways. Hence, instead of that, via the karmic path, practicing that which is easier, does not accrue sin, and as instructed by God, is appropriate.\nBecause Janaka and the others believed this firmly, karmana iva hi (only through action), karmana: e:va hi (only through action). Sri Krishna used two words that strengthen the premise. He didn’t say they attained samsiddhi (perfection) with karma (action). He said they attained karma (action) alone. [They attained self-realization] through karma (action) and through karma (action) alone! Two words are used to emphasize the point: karmana e:va hi (only through action). Janaka, as well as those others are not ordinary beings. He stood as a role model for everyone passing through the journey of life by performing karma (action). Despite being a great jna:ni (knower), he led life, taking responsibility for the kingdom. Isn’t that something ideal for all of us? Whatever is permitted, we must do that karma (action) without any hesitation. Following this, we must make our life a successful one. This is the best process. Oh Arjuna! You should follow the same process too. In verse 3.20, Sri Krishna is taking Arjuna ahead, preparing him to do his duty. We shall also gradually move forward along with him.\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of teachers).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nGod incarnated many times on earth. *Ithiha:sas* (recorded history) and *Purana:s* (ancient ever applicable works) affirm this. Why does God choose to descend on the earth? He comes down to restore the structure of the system in this world. To be precise, He comes down to reform human beings. Whatever form He takes, the purpose is to rededicate humans to their duty. Human beings generally tend to escape. They want to avoid their duties and live in comfort. They must be pulled away from such a tendency and made to fulfill their responsibilities. In general, God has the same goal in every *avatha:r* (incarnation). Among all such incarnations, Sri Krishna *avatha:r* (incarnation) is *paripu:rna* (whole). After that, most other incarnations remained in the form of deity. Thus, He graced what He wished to advise through Bhagavad Gita.\nBefore we proceed, let us offer this prayer:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn verse 3.20, Krishna states that it is inevitable to perform *karma* (actions) despite any qualification. He gave reasons for it.\nFirst one. One enters a body to carry out a responsibility. Performing *karma* (actions) is thus mandatory for every person.\n[Second one.] Since he comes with *karma* (actions) accrued over past physical births, he must perform *karma* (actions) such that he is relieved from what’s accrued. There is already a lot [accrued] from the past. The current birth is given to him to ‘spend’ that ‘deposit’. He must live only by exhausting it. If it is spent, he will be relieved of that burden to an extent. Next, he gets another set from the past. If he doesn’t do that, he will not only not exhaust the accrued, but will add to it. There is every chance of piling up to the stock of *karma* (actions). Therefore, because the body is formed for *karma a:cha:rana* (practicing karma), it must be done. It is beneficial for humans. Ultimately, it is beneficial to the world.\nGod’s responsibility is to ensure the system of the world is proper. He is referred to as a big time farmer. The entire world is like a garden that he is cultivating. To keep it properly, He puts in all kinds of efforts. He is a great cultivator. In this process, since it is only human beings who have the attitude of taking ‘wrong routes’, He gives many teachings to correct human beings. Doing our work is sometimes comfortable. Sometimes painful. Sometimes favorable. Sometimes unfavorable. Sometimes hurtful. Whatever it may be, one should not stop performing his duties. He should continue to do so. It is not appropriate for a human being to live only selfishly. The main purpose of delivering Bhagavad Gita is to give this instruction. Sri Krishna makes many attempts to teach it. He wants to somehow make him understand.\nIn chapter 3, in the process of telling him that it is appropriate for him to do his *karma* (actions), there are some exemplary practitioners of *karma* (actions) who are qualified for *jna:na yo:ga* (path of knowledge) as well. Yet, they decided that practicing *karma* (actions) is the right thing to do and lived accordingly. They are authoritative and world famous personalities like emperor Janaka and others. He [Krishna] showed them as *prama:na* (authentic examples). Janaka is called *ra:jarshi* (royal sage).\n*Janaka:dayaha ra:jarshayaha* (Janaka and others are royal sages).\nWhat is meant by *ra:jarshihi* (royal sage)?\n*jna:nina:m agre:saraha* (They are foremost among the wise).\nThey are not ordinary beings. They are great people. *Rushi* (sage) means one who is a *drasta* (one who can ‘see’ clearly). *Rushis* (sages) are great beings who analyze past and future, define the current day lifestyle and lead by example. Amongst such *rushis* (sages), there are *ra:jarshis* (royal sages). They remain devoted to such practice while additionally serving a specific responsibility. Such great beings are called *ra:jarshis* (royal sages). When explaining about King Janaka, he is referred to as ‘*ra:jarshi*’ (royal sage).\nWhat kind of people are they? They are like large oceans. They are like oceans of knowledge. *Ra:ma:nuja:cha:rya* (Acharya Ramanuja) says ‘*visthi:rna aga:dha manasaha*’ (those with broad and deep minds) to describe them.\n*visthi:rna aga:dha manasaha* (those with broad and deep minds).\nWhat is an ocean like? It’s spread broad and wide. We don’t know how long or wide. We don’t know how *aga:dha* (deep) it is. We don’t know how many varieties of living organisms it contains. We don’t know how many objects there are in there. It doesn’t behave in a way that reveals all of those. Despite having all such things in it, it does not go out of bounds, it behaves. This is the characteristic of an ocean. Like an ocean, they are ones who have a ‘deep’ heart.\nGenerally, such a person is called *ra:ja* (ruler). A *ra:ja* (ruler) is one who rules. A ruler also must have such a heart. Why? Because the country he is ruling will have many types of people, performing a variety of activities. There are many categories of topics. Some are hidden and some are to be kept secret. He can’t discuss those casually anywhere and everywhere, like a commoner. He can’t be talking to anybody and everybody. He should be careful with every step he takes and every word he speaks. He will have this responsibility as a general ruler. Additionally, if he is a *rushi* (sage) too, what happens then?\n*thathra:pi rushithva:th athi:ndriya:rdha drasta:raha* (Even among them, due to their sage-like nature, they are seers of invisible truths).\nNot only do they work with what’s visible to the eyes, they also realize the invisible and behave accordingly. Janaka belongs to that category. Additionally,\n*thathra:pi a:thmavida* (Even among them, they are knowers of the soul).\nThey are not those who observe only the physical world. They are not those who stop at only the physical world.\n*a:thma vidaha* (They are knowers of the soul).\nThey are those who properly know the nature of the indwelling *a:thma* (soul). How? Their lineage by itself has that qualification.\n*nisarga nigruhi:tha indriyathva:th* (They have all the abilities by birth to know what, how, etc.).\nAdditionally, their practices are aligned as well. Because of that,\n*prakrushto:thpatthi sathva:di:na:cha* (They always remain composed, with highly nourished *sattvam* (goodness/purity)).\n*Rajas* (greed), and *thamas* (inactiveness) are in suppressed states. You might have come across children born in certain families. Naturally, by birth, they are vocally gifted and they sing. In such families, it does not matter if it is a girl child or boy child, everyone sings. Even a pillar in their home seems to bring forth some music. The father and his ancestors are singers. The mother and her ancestors are singers. A child born in such a family will naturally know how to sing. This is an ability one gets naturally through lineage. It’s acquired by birth. If one is born in a demon family, he will naturally learn words like hit, kill, etc. Such people are used to that because of the lineage. For these [like Janaka], the lineage is such [*sa:tthvic* (of goodness)]. For great beings like King Janaka, naturally by lineage,\n*prakrushto:thpatthi sathva:di:na:cha* (always composed with highly nourished *sattvam* (goodness/purity)).\n*Ya:muna:cha:rya Swa:mi* (Swami Yamunacharya) says in *A:lavanda:r Stho:thra* (Alavandar Stotra), “Oh *Bhagava:n* (Lord)! The family that I am born into is great. Don’t look at what kind of person I am. The ancestors are the great beings who…”\n*nisarga:de:va thvath charana kamale: ka:ntha manasa:m* (by birth, i.e. naturally they dive deep and rise in the waters of service at Your divine lotus feet).\nSuch is the family lineage. I was born into such a family. Just look at only that aspect. Don’t look at what kind of person I am. If you see only me,\n*adho:dha papa:thma: saranadha: nimajja:mithamasi* (I am drowning in the waters of this *samsa:ra* (cycle of birth and death)).\nYet, look at them. Grace me because of the relationship I have with them. He prays this way.\n*nisarga:th* (naturally formed).\nNeem is by nature, bitter. Tamarind is naturally sour. These qualities are not acquired midway. Mango is naturally astringent. It gets a sour taste later and further down in time, that gets replaced with sweet taste. These are not its natural tastes. Whereas tamarind is not that way. It is sour at the start and it always remains sour. Neem is also that way. It is bitter from the start. It is *nisarga:th* (a natural state). Speaking about the family of Emperor Janaka,\n*nisarga:de:va* (right from the time of their birth),\n*nigruhi:th indriyathva:th prakrushto:thpatthi sathva:di:na:cha* (They have become great beings, i.e. *a:thma vida* (realized in *atma* (soul))).\nAdditionally,\n*a:thma vida:m agre:saraha* (foremost among those realized in the soul).\nJanaka is one who is highly revered among them. Such a great being! Despite being *a:thma vidagre:sara* (highly esteemed among those realized in *atma* (soul)),\n*karmanaivahi samsiddha:m a:sthitha:ha* (they attained perfection only through action).\nan expert in properly performing ordained *karma* (actions). King Janaka and others are such great beings. When such great beings are in that kind of state, how can you say that you don’t want to do your responsibility? Why do you say that you want to ‘become a *jna:ni* (knower)’, sitting in the forests begging for alms? This is not a suitable thing for you.\n*lo:kasangrahame:va sampasyan karthum arhasi* (You should act with a view to maintaining the order of the world).\nIn verse 3.20, Sri Krishna is instructing. You should not do it for yourself. You don’t need to do it for your well-being. You are also not permitted to abandon it because it is difficult to do or that it brings you loss.\n*lo:ka sangraham e:va:pi sampasyan* (considering the welfare of the world).\nWe must practice considering the surrounding people. Depending on how we behave, others also get influenced. Therefore, you have the need to do the proper thing, wishing well for those who look up to you. We all know - at the temple, when a father does *sa:shta:nga namaska:ra* (fully prostrating with all limbs), the son watching him will also understand the process, and learn from that. If the father puts on *thilak* (forehead marking) properly, the son also wants it and asks the father for the same. If the father chants Lord’s name with *japa ma:la* (a holy string of beads), the son also mimics the father and wants to make rounds with that *ma:la* (string of beads) without knowing what it is. If the father is dressed in clean and pure clothes, the children also desire the same. If the father himself sits on a chair to ‘happily’ take a cigarette break, the son will also want to do the same, putting his legs on father’s head! The wise elders do their duties not for themselves, but for the well-being of younger generations. Therefore, Arjuna, when King Janaka himself practices, how can you have second thoughts about it? Also, you are not *a:thma vida agre:sara* (authoritative amongst those realized in soul). Correct? Therefore, practicing *karma* (actions) is the appropriate thing for you to do.\n*asaktho:hi a:charan karma param a:pno:thi* (By performing actions without attachment, one attains the highest).\nYou will attain the highest *purusha:rth* (purpose of life). Happily practice *karma* (actions) as per the ordained responsibilities. In chapter 3, Sri Krishna is taking Arjuna forward, instructing him to mold him as duty-devoted.\n*Vande: guru paramapara:m* (I bow to the lineage of teachers).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\n(Remover of all obstacles, bestower of all wealth, the beloved of the world, Sri Rama, I bow to you again and again.)\nIn Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3, verses 20 and 21, we explore a crucial question: Why should we follow proper practices? Why can’t we simply say, “I will behave as I like – why do you care?” Krishna provides a profound reason for this. He explains that people around us tend to imitate our behavior. Therefore, if not for ourselves, we must follow proper practices for the well-being of at least those around us.\nWe must abstain from claiming, “I have attained everything, I don’t need to care about anything else.” This concept distinguishes between practicing karma (action) and practicing jnana (knowledge). It is appropriate for everyone to keep working. Dear ones, it’s not allowed for one to be in jnana yoga (the path of knowledge) in a way that implies doing nothing. There is no way you can say that you don’t do anything. As long as you are in this body, there is no question of \"doing nothing.\" You will be breathing in, breathing out, opening eyes, closing eyelids. You will be getting up, sitting, sleeping, and so on. We will have to do different kinds of activities with the body. If you say that you will remain still as if in a coma, you will get bed sores! You will trouble the ones next to you. Therefore, we must continue to do work while in the body.\nWhen working, we must take the activities of Wise Elders and their ways as a guideline. The Veda (sacred texts) clarifies this. There is wonderful teaching from a teacher to a graduate student. As part of many aspects covered in it, the teaching states:\nyada:rthe: thathra vartha:ram thatha: thathra varthe:ttha:\nthathra thathra yatha:\n(whatever they do there, you should also do there, in those places, as they do)\nThe teacher explains that whatever process the elders followed, you, dear one, should also carefully observe and follow the same. They would wake up early. They would sit up and chant the name of Lord Hari. Then, they would do exercise. They would then take a bath. Then, they would sit and apply tilak. They would then perform their respective appropriate anushtana (practices). Then, they would offer prayers to the deity. They would take prasada (that which is offered to God). They would leave for their daily routine. There is a method to carry out certain work.\nyada:the: thathra varthe:ran thadha: thathra varthe: tha:\n(Whenever a situation arises, whatever those great souls practiced, try to practice the same way but don’t go against it.)\nDon’t cross those guidelines. The teacher also gave another recommendation:\nyatha:the: the:shu varthe:ran thatha: the:shu varthe: tha:ha\n(When doing an activity, there are certain practices that contribute to completing it. They use those ‘tools’ to do the activity. You should also do the activity along with the ‘tools’.)\nWhat does it mean by ‘along with the tool’? If undertaking a primary activity, there are certain basic activities to have in place. Let’s consider ‘having a meal’ as the primary activity. It is a primary activity for everyone anyway! What is the process for having the meal? Eating whatever you find, wherever it is, makes one an animal, maybe a monkey. What should a human being do? If you want to eat, you should first clean your body, take a bath, etc. Take a bath. If you eat as soon as you wake up, that is the nature of Kumbhakarna. He is a rakshasa (demon). You are not a demon. You are a human being. Therefore, the first step is to clean your body. To clean your body properly, you will need to finish your morning routine. Complete morning routine. Finish taking a bath.\nAdditionally, remember that you are not consuming food just for the body. You are consuming it to secure energy at four levels – body, senses, manas (mind), and buddhi (intellect). Veda states that the food you consume breaks down and transforms to energize all four levels. Therefore, clean all those too. Like we clean the body, we must also clean the inner layers, i.e., manas and buddhi. To clean manas, perform something like mantra japa (chanting of sacred sounds). To clean buddhi, perform something like worshiping God. These activities clean them. Now, offer the food to God so it can be cleansed as well. Then, give it [to the body] for the purpose of providing nutrition to them [body, senses, manas, buddhi].\nWhen the primary activity is to eat food, all of these are the anga karmas (prerequisite activities). The primary karma is called angi (primary activity). The prerequisite activities are called anga karmas (auxiliary activities). They are auxiliaries. That is the main, i.e., the prime activity. There are also activities to be done after the prime activity. Wiping off with a towel and leaving that place is something that an animal would do. After eating, you must wash your hands and feet properly. You must also perform achamana (sipping of water along with chanting of mantra) three times. Just as you use two sheets to sleep, one under and another on top, similarly, if consuming food is a good means to provide nutrition for yourself, the prerequisite cleansing activities are like the sheet that is spread on the bottom. Now, consume the food. Clean your mouth and hands. Then, the post activities such as achamana, are like the blanket on the top. It’s called astharana (blanket). If you follow this process, then having the meal doesn’t become an act of eating to fill the stomach. It will become a proper, pure activity that will nourish the soul. It becomes aradhana (an act of worship). Eating a meal is also aradhana. It’s not simply aradhana, it is a brahma vidya (knowledge of the Absolute Truth)! Veda says. Eating a meal is a brahma vidya. If you know how to have a meal, consider yourself an expert in a brahma vidya. What an easy way! Meaning, the normal life you lead can become the best means for upliftment. This is what we must remember. In this example, the activity of having a meal is called angi karma (primary activity). The [pre and post] activities are anga karmas (auxiliary activities).\nyada:the: thathra varthe:ran thadha: thathra varthe: tha:\n(When consuming the meal, follow that same practice, Elders have practiced.)\nThey would sit properly and eat. They would sit facing east or north. They would sit on a slightly raised stool. They would eat on a leaf. They did not eat at a table. Sitting that way gave them good health. Thus, it is one karma.\nyatha:the: the:shu varthe:ran thatha: the:shu varthe: tha:ha\nthe:shu the:shu\n(While performing a primary activity, whatever anga karmas they practiced with expertise, you should also do the activity along with those ‘tools’.)\nMeaning, before having a meal, setting up a leaf, washing hands, worshiping God, taking tirth (sacred water), performing anushtana, taking bath, etc. All of these are anga karmas. You must practice these anga karmas properly. You must practice angi karma properly. You must observe, right? It is highly essential to observe Elders. “Why should I follow them? Why should I look at them?” “They had patience and did those activities.” “I will practice my own way.” You should not say that. You have the responsibility to observe Elders and walk on the path they set. Therefore, Sri Krishna explains whatever Vedas explained about how to perform any activity. He clarifies this in verse 3.21.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyad yad a:charathi sre:shttaha thath thade: ve:tharo: janaha |\nsa yath prama:nam kuruthe: lo:kas thad anuvarthathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhatever a great person does, others follow. Whatever standard (including the auxiliary practices) he sets, the world follows.\n-----------------------------------------------\nyad yad a:charathi sre:shttaha (whatever primary activities the Wise one practices), thath thade: ve:tharo: janaha (the world always observes them). Additionally, if one gains popularity, it implies he is sitting in a glass box. Because he is seen from all corners and angles, the world will constantly observe him. “Whatever he does, I will do the same.” “Whatever he doesn’t, I won’t.” “If Elders have stopped doing it, why should we? Let’s not do it.” This is how the world takes you. It takes you as a role model for spoiling and for abandoning. It won’t take you as a role model for upliftment.\nThere is a wonderful incident in Sankara Bhagavathpada’s life. It’s said in his history that Sankara Bhagavathpada’s disciples watched him and thought they wanted to be like him. He noticed that. “They are thinking they will do whatever I do.” “Innocent people. It’s important to teach them,” he thought. It was afternoon, and time to beg for alms. There was a goldsmith who made ornaments out of molten gold. The goldsmith put gold in a crucible. It melted and turned into molten liquid. He [Sankara Bhagavathpada] took that fluid and simply drank it! The followers watched him. They were planning to do whatever he did. Forget about drinking it. It was burning hot to even touch. They were scared to even go near it. Therefore, oh dear, don’t say that I will do it because ‘he is doing it’. We don’t know the reason why ‘he is doing it’. We don’t know what state he is in while doing that. So, if we take them as a role model and try something, we will drown midway. If we don’t want those that see us to drown, we must first follow the rule.\nSo, yad a:charathi sre:shttaha (whatever primary activities the Wise one practices), the world observes them. sa yath prama:nam kuruthe: (whatever measurement of quantity and quality is observed by them). This is a very beautiful word. Generally, it’s understood as “whatever scriptures are taken as authentic ones…” No. yath prama:nam (whatever measurement of quantity and quality is observed by them). Meaning, when one is performing an activity, whatever angas (auxiliary practices) he is practicing, to perform an activity, whatever they are practicing as part of the preface, you also observe them. sa yath prama:nam kuruthe: (whatever measurement of quantity and quality is observed by them), yadangathaya: karo:thi (whatever angas he is following to carry out an activity), you must also observe and practice it along with the angas. If you think that your practices are a guideline to others and you desire their well-being, then practice what is appropriate for their prosperity, despite it not being a necessity for you. So, you must do karma acharana (practicing activities) for their sake. Whatever is ordained responsibility to you, you must observe it. Hence, it is not right to say that you will take the path of jnana because you are eligible for it. Thus, Sri Krishna is teaching Arjuna kartavya nishta (dedication towards responsibility) in chapter 3.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nOur lives should be useful not just for our well-being, but also for the well-being of society. Every human being must realize this. We see all kinds of living beings in the world. They live properly. Because of that, nature is also in good condition. If human beings live properly, nature will also be in proper condition. Human beings, to satiate increased greed, not increased need, spoil the soil by spraying fertilizers. The insects and worms which feed on it, the animals which feed on them… Ultimately, Nature is getting spoiled, isn’t it? We do not realize beforehand. We realize it after it is spoiled.\nIf someone is practicing farming in natural ways, he gets a certain income. However, the neighboring farmer employs all kinds of fertilizers and gets higher yield and higher income. What did he do? He extracted the essence of soil, the essence of the yield, and polluted nature. He earned a high income. He goes in big cars. He constructs big buildings. If he looks down upon the other farmer, the other farmer may develop a kind of aggressiveness one day or another. Even if the farmer isn’t influenced, other people prod him, constantly advising fertilizers. In earlier days, people would set aside fertilized land for profit. For themselves, they would farm aiming for quality yield. This was once upon a time. Nowadays, farmers use the same method for the entire land and are spoiling themselves as well.\nWe met a farmer recently. He says, “What do I do? All neighboring farmers are doing it.” “What difference does it make if I am the only one following principles?” “I am also farming in the same way.” “Earlier, we were able to use a plow to till the land.” “Now, our hands lack the patience to hold the plow.” “Now, our legs have no strength to walk while tilling the land.” “There is no strength in the spine to stand.” “Unfortunately, our lives have become this way.” He himself was feeling bad for what he had to do. What’s happening is that one bad performer spoils others around him. Nature is also getting destroyed because of this. One should live properly and the surrounding nature also should be proper.\nIn fact, our life is for lo:ka sangraha (the well-being of everyone). Meaning one must live life keeping the interests of everyone’s well-being in view. We can see this in our body. If the mouth eats, thinking only about its well-being, while the body remains diseased… What can the mouth do alone? If eyes think only of their wellness, disregarding the rest of the body… How can the eyes be happy? Any part of the whole can be comfortable only if contributing to the comfort of the rest of the parts. If it ignores or forgets the rest, then both itself and others will end up going through troubles. It’s the same with human beings with respect to society. If society is to be good, human beings should be good. If human beings should be good, society should be good. They are both interdependent.\nSankara Bhagavathpa:da says… lo:kasangraha (the well-being of everyone) is… lo:kasya unma:rga pravrutthi niva:rana (to control unregulated free will). The same is called lo:ka sangraha (the well-being of everyone) or lo:ka rakshana (protection of the world). What it means is to make sure it is not destroyed.\nArjuna! Now that you know that it is appropriate to do karma a:charana (performing duties), performing duties… Do the right things. Sri Krishna instructs this to Arjuna as part of chapter 3, verses 20 and 21. What we do, becomes valid for everyone. Well, do the common people’s activities become authentic? No. However, what a famous person does becomes exemplary. Generally, activities done by any of these three, do not become bona fide. If an ignorant person does something, people don’t consider it authentic. If a child does something, it doesn’t qualify as authentic. If a child picks up bad lingo from neighbors, do we accept those to be exemplary? They are children and not yet mature, hence, we don’t need to accept them as authentic. When a father carries his child, the child might kick him. He does the same with mother or grandfather too. Because a kid kicked them, if an adult claims “I can kick my father, mother or grandfather as well.” Do we accept it? [No]. An ignorant person’s practices are not authentic. We don’t need to follow it. A baby’s or a knowledgeable but crazy person’s practices cannot be taken as authoritative. If not [crazy], his practices are authentic.\nSome people know some things. They preach, but do not practice. His practices are also not authentic. He only preaches and does not practice. On e:ka:dasi (the eleventh day of the lunar fortnight), he preaches that one must observe fasting, but he doesn’t. That day, he might even eat more than usual. Such a person who knows but doesn’t practice is also not a reliable source. One knows, and practices, but lacks popularity. No one pays attention to him. Despite doing very good activities and speaking the right things, if he doesn’t have popularity, people don’t pay attention. Many commoners speak about ethics, do people pay attention? If a leader of the nation or someone in high ranking position speaks something… people take it to the world, as well as conducting research, discussions and meetings about it. That’s because of popularity, because of being famous.\nWe should remember three things. People don’t recognize the works of an unknown person much. People don’t pay attention to one who knows but doesn’t practice. People don’t pay attention to one who is not knowledgeable. A child or a mentally incapable adult, cannot do anything because they don’t know how. These do not become authoritative ever. The world will look up to the practices of a famous person. Arjuna! You are a popular person. What you practice will end up becoming authentic. Therefore, if you are concerned for the world’s well-being, your practices should also be proper.\nlo:ka sangraham e:va:pi sampasyan karthum arhasi (You should perform your duties, keeping in mind the welfare of the world.)\nWhy? Because people will take what you do as a basis. Also, they will take how you do it as a basis. So, the work we do must be good.\nExample: Practicing sandhya: vandanam (salutation to the sun) is a rule. The rule is that one practices it three times a day. Once in the early morning. Second when the phase of the day shifts. Third when the day is setting. Because the Sun helps us in waking up when it rises. Recognizing the great help of enabling us in waking up, we must offer thankful namaskar (salutation). We must perform a sandhya: vandanam (salutation to the sun). We must submit a handful of water. The sun waxes until the afternoon and the sun wanes in the evening when setting. As the Sun reaches the [next] state, you thank him for placing you in such a stage today. You offer three handfuls of water and offer namaskar (salutation) again. This is called ma:dhya:nhika sandhya: vandanam (mid-day salutation to the sun). When the day is ending, you thank him for giving you the opportunity to see the world with… The light he emits and for giving the strength to do all your daily activities. “Oh Lord! Thank you.” Saying so, you offer another three handfuls of water before he sets. This is the third sandhya: vandanam (salutation to the sun). It’s referred to thrika:la sandhya vandanam (salutation to the sun three times a day), expressing gratitude to the sun three times a day.\nHow do you perform this? You don’t stay on the bed after waking up and drop water to the side [of the bed]. You must do the prerequisite activities such as bath, etc. You must wear clean clothes. Then, you must express prayers to the lineage of gurus. And then, you must perform sandhya vandanam (salutation to the sun). If sandhya: vandanam (salutation to the sun) is the current prime activity, there are also anga kriyas (pre and post routine activities). You must know these anga kriyas (pre and post routine activities) and practice those along with performing sandhya vandanam (salutation to the sun). It can be sandhya vandanam (salutation to the sun) or any other activity.\nIf your prime activity is to write something, how do you write? You take a book or a slate. You hold a pen or pencil. You write properly. You will write such that at least you are able to understand. Or if you are writing for someone else, you will write so that at least he understands. If writing is the prime activity, there are some angas (parts). Do you write walking, lying down, standing... Or sit cross legged, place the slate in a proper position in your lap and write? There is a method. When you are doing the activity, if a child is observing you… You want to teach him how to write… You perhaps learned it through proper methods when you were little. But now that you are grown up, you are skilled to write properly even while standing. Even while walking, you write nicely. Even while lying down, you compose letters just fine. However, if the child follows you, he won’t be able to do it. How should the child write? He should sit properly in a cross legged position. He should hold the slate properly. He should be taught to hold the chalk piece properly. Nowadays, people don’t mind if it’s right or left, whatever the child can do, let it go that way. However, earlier there was a process that shows the way to sit, hold, write. How do the young ones know? Hence, desiring for their prosperity, the adults practice it and show it to them. Firstly, they will sit cross legged. They will hold his hand. The adult will write the letter the way it should be written. It takes a long time for the little one to write by himself. The adult makes him write ten times, supporting him by holding the hand. The child may say the letter once while writing. The adult himself, says the letter aloud, at least 100 times to make the child utter it 2 times. To prepare the child for a state of dedication, the adult will practice it to teach him. In fact, the adult does not need it for himself. He mastered it long ago. Yet, desiring the well-being of the child, he steps down and practices for the sake of the child. You can take any activity. For example, sports. There may be a master who knows the sport. However, to teach a beginner, he will show the first step, second step. He shows each level, first, second, third, etc. For his sake, he will demonstrate by practicing it. Only then, will the beginner come onto the track. So, we must practice it with the world in view, keeping aside its use or benefit for us. We must never hesitate to do our duties for the sake of others. We must always be alert in this.\nSaying so, Sri Krishna talks about the dedication one must have towards the process of practices.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsa yath prama:nam kuruthe: lo:kaha thad anuvarthathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhatever pre and post process he follows for an activity, the world looks up to him to follow it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDo the activities properly along with following the proper method for all the pre and post processes.

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nFrom among the many times God descended on earth, the specific purpose of one such appearance was to show how a human life should be lived. That is Rama avathar (incarnation). Some say Rama is God. Some say Rama is a human being. According to [sage] Valmiki, Rama is a human being. In Valmiki Ramayana (epic poem),\na:thma:na:m ma:nusham manye: (I consider myself a human)\n...he clearly states that Rama says (that he is human) without any doubt. The summary is that we must look at Ramachandra only as a human being, as per Valmiki. Only then, whatever Rama did in life becomes yadartha acharana (real practice). Otherwise, it becomes a put on act in order to cheat others. In fact, nothing in Rama avathar (incarnation) is acting. He demonstrated by doing all that a human being can and should practice. We refer to Rama as the incarnation focused on acharas (practices).\nRamachandra, after turning 12, ventures into the forest with the great sage Viswamithra. Viswamithra convinces king Dasaratha, the father, and takes the son, in order to protect the yaga (ritual sacrifice) being performed. We know the story. He takes him and instructs him to protect the yaga (ritual sacrifice) for 6 days. Before that, he teaches all the astras (divine weapons) that would be needed. After completing that protection, Rama is taken to Mithila and is married to Sita. Until this point, Viswamithra is seen in history. This is what we see in the story.\nThere is an unnoticed aspect in this flow of the story. It is that we see that Ramachandra carries out his responsibilities throughout the day. Every morning, he does prathassavanam (morning routine). Every evening, he practices sandhyadi upasana (obeisances to the natural forces all around). We can observe in Balakanda (first chapter of Ramayana) that Valmiki gives this detail for every portion of the day. There is no loss if Ramachandra’s Sandhya Vandanam (daily ritual) detail is not given. However, Ramachandra was very clear about performing his responsibilities properly. This would be ideal for others who can observe and rectify their lives. That is why Valmiki Bhagavan (Lord/revered one) shows this. If Ramachandra performed his nithya karma (daily activities) without any discount or second thoughts… We need not explicitly state anything about how important these practices are for common people. Meaning - one must perform them [nithya karmas (daily activities)].\nWhat should one practice? How should one practice them? We must know these two properly. This is what shastra (Vedic scriptures) establish. God depicts the same decision in [Bhagavad Gita] chapter 3.\nyad a:charathi sre:shttaha… (whatever a great person does)\nsa yath prama:nam kuruthe: (whatever standard he sets)\nWe must observe two words carefully. [yad acharathi shreshtaha (whatever a great person does)] you must do the [right] activity. yath pramanam kuruthe (whatever standard he sets). What are the angas (supporting parts/processes), pre and post processes for the activity? While doing an activity, preparatory activities and post activities are also there. We must observe these two carefully.\nConsider ‘planting seedlings’ as a prime activity. It does not qualify as ‘planting seedling’ if you bring it from somewhere and simply plant it. There are some prerequisite activities. These are called anga karmas (supporting activities). Planting a seedling is the angi karma (prime activity) here, meaning it is the prime activity. What are the angas (supporting parts/processes) for it? Firstly, we must look for the appropriate soil. If the soil is not suitable, we must add to it or remove from it accordingly. This is the first step. Checking for the availability of the type of soil - black or red. If the place has stones, then soil must be brought in and be plowed. The weeds must be taken out. Stones, and any other waste must be removed. The soil must be cleaned. It must be watered and kept moist. We must add something like cow dung to increase its fertility. Now, the seed or the seedling must be planted. If we don’t do any of these and plant the seedling, it will die within a day or two. We hear program announcements where it is said that some lakhs of seedlings are planted. Shouldn’t we have greenery all around if that many lakhs and crores of saplings are planted? There are many prerequisite activities that must be taken care of. They are called anga karmas (supporting activities). Meaning the way of preparing for the activity, understanding the boundaries of the activity, etc. To plant the seedling, or to till the land, there are many tools required like a plough, rake, shovel, basket, etc. We use all these tools to prepare the land. To water the land, we need a watering can fitted with holes, etc. We take all these, do the work, and plant the seedling.\nNow, if we simply wash our hands and leave the place, what’s the use? This does not mean the work is completed. Just like there are preparatory activities, there are also post activities. What are the post activities? After planting, have we built a raised surface surrounding it to contain the water, or not? Have we cleaned all the tools used and put them back in their places, or not? Have we taken care of ensuring that the plant is watered from the next day onwards, or not? If you do all of these, then you can say you planted a sapling. Not simply walking off after planting while a goat walks up and eats the whole thing. This does not qualify for planting a sapling.\nSome people bring garlands bought from the market as an offering. Their goal is to garland someone. Indeed, it’s a good wish. They bring it in some plastic cover or a wrapped paper. They reach the person. Then, they take it out of the cover and throw the cover aside. There is a string [holding it together]. They take that out and throw it onto the other side. The garland is drenched in water. They simply take that and put it on the person and leave, thinking the job is done. Is this how one should garland someone? Rather, it’s peaceful for both people if he simply does not garland him at all. He is simply drenching the person in water. If you really want to garland someone, have it properly made and bring it wrapped in a neat cloth. Before reaching the person, take off the cloth and put it in your bag. Now, garland him. That is what garlanding is. Not when you throw a paper to one side, string to another, and something else somewhere else.\nSome people felicitate others with a shawl. As soon as it is opened, a paper sleeve drops. They leave the paper there itself, offer the shawl, stand beside the person, take a photo, and leave. He thinks his job is done and leaves the place. For the ‘sin’ of getting felicitated with the shawl, he ends up having to clean up the place. This is not [how an] activity [should be done]. There are a set of activities before starting the work and after finishing it. Those should be observed as well. One is the primary activity and there are pre and post activities as well. A qualified person must continue to practice both of them.\nThere was a master ji. Earlier, there used to be letters that were written and sent. Nowadays, it’s all in emails. We just read it on the screen, reply there, and the task is done. It’s easy and keeps both sides happy. Earlier though, letters were written and put in an envelope and sent. The master ji would not simply tear the envelope in any way. He would tear it open properly till almost the edge keeping it with the envelope. After reading the letter, he would tear it all the way through. Then, he would put it in the envelope and drop it either in the dustbin or use it some other way. There is a way an object should be used, or the care that it needs.\nThe same for anything - like cleaning a room. Taking a broom, bringing what’s in the corners to the center of the room, and back to the corners. In the name of cleaning the room… Bringing everything back and forth without considering the direction of the air flow. Making everything messy! This cannot be called cleaning the room, can it? To clean a room, one must take a broom and first observe the direction of airflow. If air is flowing in a direction, and you sweep in the same direction… The dirt blows to your face and on everyone inside. Observing the direction of airflow, accordingly sweep in the correct direction. Then, finish by placing the broom in whatever corner it needs to be kept. Most people put the broom exactly in the east corner. Not sure why, but most people put it there only. It should be put in its proper place. One’s hands should be cleaned properly. Then, on to the next activity. There is a way to do a certain activity. It is a rule.\nEarlier when our elders were drying their clothes… They would wash, scrub, rinse again in water, wring out the water, brush off… Then fold them, and dry them on the hanger. The borders and edges would all be neatly set while hanging. After drying, there would be no need to iron them. Taking it off the hanger directly, it would be good enough to fold and place into the cupboard. It would be neatly done. Tamilians do it very well. Maybe they learnt it from their elders. We should learn good habits, wherever they are practiced. This kind of care should be in every activity one does. Waking up, tossing the blanket aside, and the same with the sheet - walking out leaving them as they are…… Instead, fold both the sheet and blanket properly. Place them in some almirah, closet, or wherever they should be. If you spare a second of thought on that activity, it will give you a chance to do it correctly. This goes for everything. If one has interest, he would observe the elders and learn to follow properly.\nRama had that kind of qualification within. That is why he became the ideal human being. He became maryada purushottama (one who behaves knowing the limits). What’s the right way to do a task? This is good for us and for people around us. Arjuna! That’s why it’s necessary for everyone to work in this way. Sri Krishna explains this in chapter 3, verses 20 and 21.\nlo:ka sangraham e:va:pi sampasyan karthum arhasi (you should act for the welfare of the world)\nLearn the right way of practicing things for the well-being of everyone around you. The process to be followed. The activities to be done. Because, people will look up to you to follow them. For their well-being, try to practice properly.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyad a:charathi sre:shttaha thath thade: ve:tharo: janaha\nsa yath prama:nam kuruthe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhatever a great person does, others follow. Whatever standard he sets, the world pursues.\n-----------------------------------------------\n‘Yath pramanam’ (whatever standard) is an important word. Does not mean any worldly or Vedic activity. Yath pramanam (whatever standard). Whatever limits or boundaries to follow, whatever supporting activities there are to do any task… Everyone intends to learn by observing the wise practitioners before us. “You are someone who has reached a key position.” “Thus, you must practice carefully and become a role model for others.” Janaka and the rest practiced the same way. “Why go to Janaka and the rest, I am a famous person too.” “Look at how I am practicing.” Sri Krishna is showing Himself as pramana (means of knowledge), to teach dedication to karma (action). He moves forward accordingly to chapter 3, verse 22. Gradually, let us also move ahead.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

He incarnated in many time periods. The great sage Parasara explains it thus…\nsamastha shakti rupani tatkaroti janeswaraha\ndeva tiryan manushyakhyaha chestavanti swalilaya (The Lord, who is the embodiment of all powers, performs actions as gods, animals, and humans through His own play)\nIt’s not out of any need for Him, but swalilaya (with ease, as a divine play) for the sake of uplifting us. We have earlier discussed this. Elders, when writing or doing other activities, work as if they are having to put in a lot of effort. They do so to teach us, not because they need to act. If they don’t work hard, we won’t learn the skill required in those activities. That is why they also do that. God did this many times.\ndeva tiryan manushyakhyaha (as gods, animals, and humans)\nHe was born as a devata (divine being), God’s administrative force, as a manushya (human being), as an animal and many other forms. Why?\njagatam upakaraya na sa karma nimittaja chesta (His actions are not born of karma, residual from past lives)\njagatam upakaraya (only to uplift the world)\nHe is not an ordinary being. He is aprameya (immeasurable, beyond comprehension).\ntasya aprameyasya vyapini avyavahatatmatika (His immeasurable, all-pervading nature is beyond ordinary action)\nWhatever He did, He did for the sake of uplifting the world. He has done countless such acts. That is why, speaking about Him, Ramanujacharya Swami says…\njagadupakruti martyaha (He takes human form for the benefit of the world)\nDespite having no necessity, He was born as a human being for the sake of the world. In fact, human birth is a tough one. One must go through many difficulties. One must dwell in the womb for 9 months. As if 9 months weren’t enough, He was in the womb for 12 months.\ntatastu dwadase mase chaitre navamiketithau (Then, in the twelfth month, on the ninth day of Chaitra)\nHe stepped into the world spending 12 months in the womb. Bhagavatam describes the kind of difficult time one goes through in the womb. We don’t know it now because we don’t remember it after birth. He goes through these only for the benefit of the world. He took the form of a human being because we are human beings. Because we are more likely to imitate someone like us than any others. If some devata (divine being) practices something, we say… “They are devatas (divine beings), they can do anything.” If an animal does something, we say… “An animal can do whatever. It’s possible for them.” If one human being practices something, anyone can do it. Therefore, He incarnated as a human being and practiced despite it not being necessary. He practiced sincerely and very seriously. He did not hesitate to work anywhere. Whatever work and in whatever way… He was born as a cowherd boy. A cowherd boy must take the cattle for grazing. He took the responsibility of taking care of them. As a small kid, He was given the responsibility by His parents, of taking care of only calves. Because, He was a 4 or 5 year old kid. Unsure of whether he could protect the bigger cattle, they gave him all the calves. He went along with the calves. To teach them, He did activities similar to whatever they should do. They must eat grass. They don’t know. He went to the grasslands and put his mouth close to the grass. It seems they watched Him and followed Him. After that, He would take them to river Yamuna and stand in knee-high water. The calves would follow Him and do the same. He put His mouth on the surface and started to have some water and they learned from Him. Was all this necessary for Him? No. However, He felt responsible for those dependent on Him. That is why, He did all of the work. He says this in chapter 3.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna me: pa:rtthasthi karthavyam thrishu lo:ke:shu kinchana |\nna: nava:ptham ava:pthavyam vartha e:va cha karmani ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nO Partha, there is nothing for Me to do in the three worlds, nor is there anything to be gained that I have not already gained; yet, I am engaged in action.\n-----------------------------------------------\nkarmani aham varte eva cha (I am also very firm in performing my duties). It does not imply that I am doing that work or involved with it because...\nna anavaptam avaptavyam (there is nothing I will gain by doing something today, that I didn’t have earlier)\nThis is not the case for us. If we don’t do something today, we won’t get what we want and may not meet our ends. He is someone who does not need to work to earn a living.\navapta samasta kamaha (one whose desires are all fulfilled)\nIt does not mean that He had attained everything. We must observe the words carefully.\navapta samasta kamaha (one whose desires are all fulfilled)\navapta (attained)\nsamastha kamaha (all desires)\nThat is not right.\napta samasta kamaha (one who has attained everything)\nna apta samasta kamaha (one who does not have anything to attain)\nThat is why, He has become avapta samasta kama (one whose desires are all fulfilled). I do not need anything. Why does He not need anything? Where does He not need anything? Maybe we don’t need anything in this world. We don’t know what happens if we reach the higher worlds. To earn comfortable space in those worlds, we work in this world. To earn happier times in the later years, we are working in the current time. We don’t know if the higher worlds exist. For some, it’s not clear if we will go there or not. It’s okay. However, they work today for a healthier tomorrow. They work today and save up a little for a comfortable tomorrow. He cannot see tomorrow but works for it. Similarly, we can’t see the next life but some people stock up on punya (good deeds) etc for it. I don’t have to do anything like that.\ntrishu lokeshu kinchana avaptavyam (nothing to attain in the three worlds)\nna me Partha asti (O Partha, there is not for Me)\nThere is nothing that I need to attain. Why? Who is He? Firstly…\nsarveswarasya me (of Me, the Lord of all)\nme (Me)\nEverything is in that word. Who is saying that word?\nsarveswarasya (of the Lord of all)\nIs that so? Is He the Supreme? We won’t have clarity until we go further. He is saying it now. Arjuna is also listening. Are you that great? If so, let me see. He said, “Come on, will show you.” He presented His viratrupa (Universal form). He, Arjuna, trembled and went into a state where he didn’t know what was happening. He cried out and pleaded that the form be withdrawn.\nsarveswarasya avapta samasta kamasya (of the Lord of all, whose desires are all fulfilled)\nHe does not have anything that He desires to fulfill. Is there anything that He does not know?\nsarvajnasya (of the all-knowing)\nHe is all knowledgeable. He knows about every species. Not only that, He is satya sankalpasya (of one whose resolutions come true). He achieves anything just by making a sankalpa (resolution). Veda declares…\ntadaikshata bahusyam praja eyeyti (He resolved, \"May I become many, may I be born\")\nHe states this sankalpa (resolution). This resolution is given a name as bahu bhavana sankalpa (resolution to become many). Meaning He was just one. He made a resolution to become Many. It is called bahu bhavana sankalpa. What happened as soon as He made the sankalpa?\nsatta yachchabhavatu niruktancha niruktancha nilayanancha nilayanancha satyamchanrutamta satyamabhavatu yadidam kincha (That which exists, that which is defined and undefined, that which has a dwelling and no dwelling, truth and untruth, all that exists became truth)\nThe moment He makes the sankalpa (resolution)… Whatever we see today in the world: moving, stationary, having a form, formless… Those that are not perceivable or cannot be named… All types of species and objects…. Everything emerged just because of the effect of the sankalpa (resolution) He made. “No, all of this happened naturally, not as an effect of someone’s sankalpa (resolution)!” You must believe this word until you are able to explain how it all happened naturally. How did it happen? “Big Bang…!” Neither you nor others know whether that Big Bang happened. Unless you research and say why that happened or how it happened… Listen to what Veda states and live as per the direction. After you find out about that theory, and when everyone accepts it and it is proven… Then, walk that path. Until then, do this. There is nothing that won’t happen when He makes a sankalpa (resolution) for it.\nsatya sankalpasya (of one whose resolutions come true)\nIt didn’t stop there.\ntrishu lokeshu deva manushyadi rupena swachchhandato vartamanasya (of Him who exists in the three worlds in forms like gods and humans by His own will)\nEverything that He created in the higher worlds, lower worlds… Since we don’t know what is there in those worlds, let’s take human beings. All the species that are lower than human beings and higher than them… He is the One dwelling in them all enabling them to function by their names.\naham atma Gudakesha sarvabhuta asayashithaha (I am the Self, O Gudakesha, dwelling in the hearts of all beings)\nAt another instance, He says…\nbhramayan sarvabhutani yantrarudani mayaya (making all beings revolve as if mounted on a machine by My illusory power)\nI am the one. In Bhagavad Gita, He explicitly expressed this statement many times at many instances. So, He does not have any need to be dwelling in any of these. He has nothing to attain by doing this. However, there is no life for anything without Him. He is dwelling in all of them to give them existence and purpose. If He doesn’t do that, there is no other way for them to get out of the bondage of karma (action). That is why, to help them, He dwells in them letting them be called by a certain name. In fact, they are not the ones to be referred to by those names. He is the one any name must be ultimately mapped to. If you are known by a name and working with that identity, that’s because God exists underlying you. That is why that name also must get mapped to Him ultimately. We are not letting that name reach there. We are holding onto it and walking with our heads up with those names. “It’s okay. Go ahead”. He says and stays within to help us.\nkinchidapi kartavyam nasti adapi lokarakshayai karmani eva varte (There is nothing for Me to do, yet I am engaged in action for the protection of the world)\nvarte eva cha karmani (Despite having no necessity, whatever is suitable for Me, I am indeed engaged in action)\nIf I am born as a cowherd boy, I will behave as a cowherd boy. If it’s Yadava, then as Yadava. If it’s as Rama, then as Rama. If He is born as Upendra, will behave as devata (divine administrative force of God). Depending on how I take birth, I take up the respective responsibility without any hesitation… Without any room for abandoning anything, I keep on working.\nvarte (I exist, I am engaged)\nHe used present tense.\nkarmani (in action)\nHe exists currently as archamurti (deity). He is existing there as He should. He is not crossing any limits, or deviating from His path anywhere. Therefore, if I am practicing all of this, then who are you? “I will quit my responsibility. I will stop doing karma (action). I will sit in jnana yoga (path of knowledge).” Who are you to think this way? You must practice your karma (duty). “Come on! Take on your responsibility” In 3.22, God is presenting Himself as pramana (basis for knowledge, authority), to motivate Arjuna.\nvande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of gurus)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

There is no question whether one is young, old, male or female. It applies to everyone. They should first know what their responsibilities are. Accordingly, they should carry out their conduct. For how long? Until the responsibilities are fulfilled. Some people say, “My responsibilities are all fulfilled now.” If you ask them what responsibilities have they fulfilled? They say… I have given birth to three kids. I got them married. I built three houses and gave them one each. Also, I gave them a certain balance in the bank. My responsibilities are fulfilled. That’s animal-like. Is this why you have taken birth as a human being? You gave birth to three kids. A pig gives birth to twenty-five piglets in one delivery. You worked hard three times to give birth to the three. It also takes care of its kids as they grow. If any animal tries to attack its kids, it pounces back and protects its kids. You are also doing the same. In fact you are not letting your kids work hard to make their own money, you are saving up for them. You are giving them a ready-to-move-in house and are giving them bank deposits. You contributed to their destruction. Is this what we should be doing? Do we say that our responsibility stops there? Is that our responsibility?\nWhatever samprada:ya (tradition), systems and principles, and samska:ra (cultural impressions), ancestors have passed onto you… How much of that have you been able to pass on to the next generation? Isn’t that your responsibility? Otherwise, what is the difference between pigs and us? An animal is passing on its practices to its children with no compromises whatsoever. If a human being does not pass on what he was given by his ancestors… What did he attain being born as a human being? The main responsibility of human life is to pass on the samprada:ya (tradition), samska:ra (cultural impressions) and a:charana (practices). This is what one should do. Despite being so great, Sri Krishna is demonstrating this Himself, as an example. “I am also living with the prime responsibility of carrying out my responsibilities.” He says it to Arjuna to motivate him for carrying out his responsibilities.\nIn chapter 3, verse 22…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna me: pa:rtthasthi karthavyam thrishu lo:ke:shu kinchana |\nna:n ava:ptham ava:pthavyam vartha e:va cha karmani ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere is nothing I need to earn. There is no loss if I don’t work. There is no use with what I get from doing something.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYet… Because I have come in the form of a human being… a:thma:nam (Himself) came here Himself, in the form of a human being. He says a little later, `avaja:nanthi ma:m mu:da:ha manushi:m thanuma:sritham` (Fools disregard Me when I assume a human form). I came here as a human being. Hence, I am also doing what is necessary to do as a human being. As a human, one should do his karma (ordained activities). You are also a human being. You should also do your karma (ordained activities). Do it properly. Your karma (ordained activities) is to fight in the war. Do it. “Does it mean to wage war and conquer everyone else?” No. It implies suppressing unjust rulers and giving the state its rightful rulers. This is what needed to be done. That is why Arjuna had to fight the righteous war that day.\nI am also fulfilling the responsibilities that shaped up for me. When I was young, there were many who rose to suppress the people of Go:kulam (Gokulam). Pu:thana (Putana), Sakata (Shakata), Pralambha (Pralambha)… Didn’t I also suppress them? Didn’t I bring about an end to a person like Kamsa (Kamsa) who was torturing the world including my parents? I never shirked any of my responsibilities. In the stage of being a student, didn’t I seek [teachings] from Sa:ndi:pani (Sandipani)? Didn’t I learn academics? Did I learn properly or not? For as long he taught, I learnt for that long. He taught for 64 days. I learnt the 64 arts in 64 days. It’s a rule that a student submits guru dakshina (offerings to the teacher), ‘offerings’ to the teacher, in return for what he taught. Haven’t I followed it? A:cha:rya (Teacher)! What can I submit in return for the teachings you bestowed me with? “Someone like You has come to learn from me! What else can I ask? Such great glory You have crowned me with! Guru for Sri: Krishna and Balara:ma! I don’t need anything else.” He thought that’s what the guru would say. He didn’t. Instead he said he would ask his wife and let Him know.\nGuru Sa:ndeepani (Sandipani), having taught 64 arts, knew that He [Krishna] is the great one, none other than parama:thma (God). Hence, He thought he would ask Him mo:ksha (liberation) for the Lord Himself has come to learn from him. He [Krishna] thought He could get everything ready [for Sa:ndi:pani’s (Sandipani’s) mo:ksha (liberation)]. However, it was a great disappointment for Krishna. He said he wants to ask his wife. What could He do? He waited. What did his [Sa:ndi:pani’s (Sandipani’s)] wife do? She asked for the return of her lost child. Look at the irony! In fact, what is the goal of having a child? After the father leaves the body, a son does the sra:rdha karma (annual rites), and pinda prada:na (offerings). What is the purpose of those activities? Because it is God’s instruction, it reaches [the departed soul] when they do [that activity]. We practice it because it is God’s instruction. Not because we see that whatever is being offered is reaching there. We don’t know it in any other way. We can’t go there and see. Sa:sthra (scriptures) declare that it [the offering] goes and reaches. We practice it because of the belief in scriptures. Because scriptures are instructions of God, what we do is for the service of God and His joy. When the same God directly asks you what you want… It would have been appropriate to seek eternal bliss. Just because one asks does not imply He orders for a flight and sends the seeker to mo:ksha (liberation). Until the time for mo:ksha (liberation), for as long as you are in the body… He will let the seeker experience the pleasures of the body. Only then, He will grace you with it [mo:ksha (liberation)]. He has this quality too. Ve:da (Vedas) declared this too. However, even the great Sa:ndi:pani (Sandipani) asked for his dead son as guru dakshina (offerings to the teacher). Okay, as a disciple, it is My duty to give that ‘offering’, I gave them their kid. I am also practicing guru dakshina (offerings to the teacher). What is the need for me to do it? Do I accrue any sin if I don’t do it? Do I get put in any hell for not doing it? Yama in the hell is also My da:sa (servant), works for Me. Yama also works as per My instruction. `mruthyurdha:vathi panchama ithi` (the Vedas declare that death also works as per My direction). Therefore, I don’t have anything I need from it. I don’t fear it either. Yet, I practiced guru dakshina (offerings to the teacher). I respectfully offered it. Because it is good to let the world see the importance of guru dakshina (offerings to the teacher).\nThe great poet Ka:lida:sa (Kalidasa) writes a wonderful episode of history about the great Kautsa. It was during the emperor Raghu’s (Raghu’s) time period. Kautsa was a disciple who learned under the tutelage of a great one named Varathanthu (Varatantu). He studied for about 25 years and completed the course. He prostrated to the guru. Revered Guru, You taught me for all this while and made me a person. Please tell me what to offer as guru dakshina (offerings to the teacher). I will do as per your instruction. He said so. “What will you give me? You grew up under my supervision. You live happily. That is itself a huge repayment.” The Guru said. No no! I must do guru dakshina (offerings to the teacher). Please tell me what you want. He forced the guru despite his resistance. Guru got angry and vexed. Do you think you can repay? Then go ahead. “Tell me what I can submit.” Stand up on a big elephant and raise your hand. Get me gold that fills all that space. The disciple was shocked but did not get disappointed. The guru has given an instruction. He would pass me an instruction only if I can implement it. He said he will begin to try. He approached King Raghu (Raghu) to start with. Just about then, he had performed a mega ya:ga (ritual sacrifice) called sarvasva dakshina:ka (a ritual sacrifice where one gives away everything). Sarvasva dakshina:kam (a ritual sacrifice where one gives away everything) is a ya:ga (ritual sacrifice) that ends with giving away everything that one owns. He gave away everything including the kingdom, things, ornaments, decor and everything. He was just about to leave for the forests. Right then, the boy Kautsa reached there.\nWhat is the [king’s] responsibility now? We must observe everyone’s responsibility. Because the person who is visiting is a guest, he must be welcomed. This is a rule. So, what did he do as the first step? He called his wife to get him a pot for holding water that he will offer the boy for cleansing his feet. However, there is nothing left with him, not even any pots. He had given everything away. He found a pot and a plate made of mud nearby. They brought the mud plate and water in the pot. He [The emperor Raghu] washed his [Kautsa’s] feet. Kautsa understood the position of the host. He was once a king. An emperor! Now, he is using a mud pot to wash the feet. What does he have to give! He understood the situation. After the king offered some flowers and paid respects, Kautsa got ready to leave. He said he will leave now. He asked the boy what brought him there because he wouldn’t approach him for no reason. [He responds…] What can I ask? I observed your situation. You are using a mud pot to wash feet. I did not want to ask you anything considering there is no scope for it. Whoever comes to me will not go empty-handed. Whatever desire you have come to fulfill, say it. He followed his dharma (duty). Then, he expressed. When he was being forced, he had to. When I asked my guru what he wanted as guru dakshina (offerings to the teacher)… He asked for wealth that fills from the ground to the height of a person’s raised hand standing atop an elephant. I have come with a desire for that wealth but I don’t intend to ask you that anymore. He [the king] said, it’s okay. Rest for the day, we will talk about it tomorrow. The same night, he summoned his commander of forces and declared war against Kubera (Kubera). He asked Kubera (Kubera) whether he would give all the wealth he wanted or get ready for war. Kubera (Kubera) is such a righteous divine being. He understood the righteous intent of the king and filled the king’s treasury with wealth. Look at how the king follows his responsibility again. He was informed that the treasure chest is filled and that they need not wage war with Kubera (Kubera). He said, okay. He called the boy and asked him to take it all. He said he didn’t need all of it and that he wouldn’t take even a little beyond what the guru asked. The king said that all the wealth has come for him and that he should take it. The boy declined. This wonderful history is retold to help us understand the responsibilities of each one.\nSummary is that… ‘Submitting guru dakshina (offerings to the teacher)’. Kautsa did it. I also did it. I did help Sa:ndi:pani (Sandipani). We must help relatives. Duryo:dhana (Duryodhana) approached me. Arjuna also approached me. Both are relatives. Both are equal in My eyes. He asked for 10,000 army men. I gave him My Atropos. Arjuna, you, asked for Me. I came to you to drive your chariot. Observe that I also have never backed off from my responsibility. Otherwise why will I come into the warfield. I could have had a better time somewhere else. I could have been in the kingdom. When you both are quarreling, why do I need to be here? However, you asked that I be of help to you, drive the chariot. He asked for an army. I gave him what he wanted. I am doing what you need. Not because I need to do it. If I don’t do this, there is no one who will question Me. There is also no one to appreciate Me by garlanding or something if I do this for you. After all this work, you questioned Me whether I didn’t know to open the door as a charioteer. Arjuna did this at a later point in time. It is not His responsibility to manage how others are receiving Him. His primary concern is to abide by His duties properly.\nna me: pa:rtthasthi karthavyam… vartha e:va cha karmani || (Despite not having the need to, I am performing My responsibilities.) You must also do the same. You must also never compromise in doing your karma (ordained activities). You must do it. Hence, whatever your current responsibility is, prepare for it. Don’t say “I will go to jna:na yo:ga (path of knowledge). Will go to the forests and beg for alms if needed.” `sre:yo bho:kthum bhaikshyamapi` (It is better to live by begging). Don’t say such words. Saying so, Sri Krishna is inspiring Arjuna to face his responsibility. Vande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of teachers)."

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nHuman beings are born with responsibilities. They should never ignore them. Whatever society decides as appropriate responsibilities based on his position and birth, we must always follow those without any deviations. Shortcuts are not allowed. This is what Sri Krishna is teaching us in chapter 3. The name of chapter 3 in Bhagavad Gita is Karma Yoga (path of action). We must perform our responsibilities in proper order. What does proper order mean? What am I doing? How am I doing that? For what purpose am I doing that? If you develop the right understanding of these and then do them, that becomes yoga (union). It becomes Karma Yoga. Summary is that it is not only important to do the work, but also to do it with an understanding of the how and why.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI bow again and again to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nTo enlighten Arjuna with this, Krishna presented examples of those like Janaka who was already a popular figure in history. King Janaka was a great jnani (person of knowledge), a person of higher knowledge. Not just a normal jnani (person of knowledge) but a great jnani (person of knowledge). In those days, Elders would continue to reach Janaka and pay obeisances. His meetings always hosted discussions on scriptures, Vedanta (essence of Vedas). Great avadhanis (experts), like Ashtavakra also would participate in those. He emerged as a great jnani (person of knowledge) naturally for having completed studying with Yajnavalkya Maharshi. History tells this. Despite being a great jnani (person of knowledge), he never compromised on his duties even a bit, at any level. That is why, recognizing him specially, Krishna says:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarmana iva hi samsiddhim a:stthitha: janaka:dayaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHaving qualified for jnana yoga (path of knowledge), he took up karma yoga (path of action) as the right course of action.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSuch a great person himself decided that it is essential to do his duties and not abandon them. What should we say about common people? In fact, he is not attached to the body. His lineage itself is of this nature. The name of the lineage is Videha (without body attachment). They are all Videha (without body attachment) kings. Videha (without body attachment) are those whose raga (attachment), with deha (body), has shed. Attachment with the body has left them. Their interest towards catering for bodily needs, bodily well-being is limited to basic necessities. Their primary focus is taking care of responsibilities while meeting the purpose of their life. Such is his lineage. They are fully qualified for jnana yoga (path of knowledge). Yet, they practiced karma yoga (path of action). It goes without saying, that those who are not at that level will need to practice [karma yoga (path of action)].\nKrishna is clarifying this to Arjuna. He adds, “Put aside others, look at Me.” He is giving Himself as an example.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna me: pa:rtha:sthi karthavyam thrisulo:ke:su kinchana:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI do not have any needs or responsibilities.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe discussed it earlier. I don’t incur any loss or gain any benefit by doing anything. Yet, I also am properly practicing the responsibilities as per My lineage. Aren’t I? Sri Krishna is declaring Himself as an example.\nRegarding fulfilling our responsibilities, it is recommended that we follow practices of the Elders. Summary is that we also must follow the Elders. To follow the Elders, we must first approach and serve them. Arjuna was somehow in the right mood and so he asked:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsishyasthe:ham sa:dhima:m thva:m prapannam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI am your disciple, please guide me, who has surrendered to you.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe was able to look at Krishna as the Elder and bow down folding hands. Therefore, he approached and sought guidance from the Elders. However, there was a reason for why Arjuna approached and sought guidance from Krishna. He needed an able charioteer to fight in the war. He asked Krishna to take on that task as he knew of His abilities. He didn’t approach Krishna for being uplifted by Him.\nEarlier in an instance where a great person was losing his child soon after the birth, every single time. He sought help from Arjuna telling him how he has no idea what is happening to the fetus. He said that he had tried many times and that not a single child could be saved. He sought his help. Arjuna promised the person that he would take care of it and asked him to let him know when it's time. When the person’s wife was in labor, he informed Arjuna. Arjuna created a wonderful protective layer of arrows. He built it so well that nothing can sneak in from any side. He was also guarding in person. However, they said the child took birth and immediately vanished. Arjuna felt ashamed. He felt extremely sad for not being able to keep his word. He created an agnihotra (fire altar) and got ready to end his life. Looks like he has the habit of making promises, and would jump into fire if he misses. If something like this happens, His sister Draupadi will be the one who will experience grief. Unable to see the sister’s sorrow, Sri Krishna would watch out for them and protect them. For the sake of Draupadi, He kept protecting the Pandavas. He would be the one keeping the promises they make. Seeing Him backing them up, they kept going as per their wish. Akin to some people who show off looking at their leader.\nArjuna promised that great brahmin (priest) that he would protect his child. The child could not be protected and so he decided to jump into the fire. Krishna had to look after him again! He asked him not to attempt to jump into the fire. He said that He would bring the child to him before sunset. He invited Arjuna to join him if he wanted to keep himself up to date. He took Arjuna along in the chariot to somewhere beyond all the planets. He went in there and brought back the child. We all know that it takes a week to go from the earth to the moon using rockets. He took off in the morning, traveled outside of the solar system past many constellations, got the work done, and came back by evening! All this while, Arjuna did not experience even the slightest turbulence. After witnessing this, Arjuna felt that all this while he thought that our Krishna only knew how to steal butter and lie! Arjuna realized how great a charioteer He is! He then desired for Krishna to be his charioteer in the upcoming Mahabharata war. He had the desire to win the war utilizing the proficiency of Krishna’s charioteering. He sought Krishna with this desire. Looking at the history, it looks like he sought Krishna out of this desire and not faith. So, Arjuna sought Krishna that day. At any other time, he did not feel the desire to approach Him.\nUnless one seeks the Elders, one will not know the intricacies in carrying out ordained responsibilities. It is said that Dharmaraja is known to be a manifestation of dharma (righteous conduct). Even he made it a responsibility to approach, serve and learn from the Elders. Dhritarashtra is his father’s brother, i.e. uncle. He is the reason for all the difficult times they faced. From their childhood till after the Mahabharata war concluded, he kept trying to harm them till the last minute where he tried to kill Bhima. Even for such a person, after the Mahabharata war concluded, Dharmaraja arranged a proper place for Dhritarashtra and Gandhari. He would go there everyday, pay respects and seek blessings. Why? Because there is a reason for that.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnithyam vruddho:pase:vinaha abhiva:dana si:lasya chathva:rithasya vardhanthe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose who serve the Elders, bow their heads and express their interest in them will grow in 4 ways.\n-----------------------------------------------\nLongevity, fame, wealth, younger generations of the family. They will live longer. They will attain fame and name. They will attain wealth. Their lineage will continue. Shastra (scripture) declares that one will see growth in all the four. That is why, in spite of [Dhritarashtra] being harmful, Dharmaraja had respect for him. Summary is to seek guidance from Elders. Only then, we will know the recommendations. One will then know how to conduct ourselves.\nArjuna! I am also not deviating or compromising in serving and seeking guidance from Elders. I have also served Sandipa. I did what he asked for. I served him for 64 days and learnt 64 arts. As guru dakshina (offering to teacher), I did fetch them their kids. Didn’t I? I also have never compromised nor turned back on the responsibilities. When I am doing these even when I don’t need to, what about someone like you who needs to be doing them? Because you have the desire to rule the kingdom. You desire to have all the relatives. You desire to enjoy the royal luxuries with them. Earlier, didn’t you express sorrow that you wouldn’t be able to enjoy without all of them? When those who have no desires are practicing their responsibilities properly, it does not make sense that you, having desires, think of abandoning responsibilities. Saying so, Sri Krishna is presenting His practice as an example.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna:n ava:ptham ava:pthavyam vartha e:va cha karmani\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI have nothing new today that I need to attain, yet I am practicing karma (action).\n-----------------------------------------------\nPresenting His practices as an example, He is moving Arjuna ahead, inspiring him to practice his responsibility.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the entire world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBhagavad Gita is God’s upade:sa (teaching) that guides Arjuna about his responsibility. Especially in Chapter 3, Sri Krishna, while teaching the way and the purpose of doing one’s work, says one must do it because it’s his responsibility and not for any benefit.\nIt could be irritating to work without any expectations for results and only as a responsibility. For example, you will get good marks if you study. Because the result is good marks, you will want to study. Obtaining a certificate will motivate you to study. A job needs a certificate. The desire to get selected for it will make you want to work for the certificate. Only when there is a resulting benefit in sight, will one want to make efforts on the work that yields that result. If you now say not to expect any result, there is something we must observe here. It does not say not to experience the result. It says not to expect the result.\nA farmer sows seeds in the soil. He hopes for a good yield and does everything he needs to. Sowing the seeds, plowing properly, and anything else are all his duties. Hence, he will do all of that. He will be happy if there is a good yield. He will be unhappy if the yield is not there. However, he does not do his activities with yield as the goal in his mind. He keeps working because it’s his responsibility. Let’s say there is no yield this year. He won’t say that he will not work this year, because there may not be a yield next year too. A farmer never works on the basis of some guarantee in the yield. Working hard is his responsibility. He will thus keep working. This is also very essential in daily life. A person must do all his worldly responsibilities.\nIn Chapter 3, Sri Krishna explains the significance of this. He presents Janaka and Himself as examples for it. Arjuna raises a request for clarification: \"Krishna! You are the God of the de:vathas (divine administrative forces). You are the first one. It is through You that all the de:vathas (divine administrative forces) are born, Nature is born. It is through You that all the species have emerged. You are the cause for all beings. When You come into this world, what is the need for You to work?\"\nFor someone like us, there is an authority over us. They enforce and perhaps punish us if we don’t complete our work. As an employee in an organization, if one does not complete his work in the designated time frame, the respective authority will question the person and punish for not completing it. If the same person completes more than what’s assigned, he may be given some benefit. What it means is that there is a benefit, loss, or difficulty for working and not working respectively. Arjuna asks Krishna if He also incurs some loss if He doesn’t work. Krishna replies, \"No. There is nothing I need.\" \"Is there any benefit He gets if He works?\" \"That is also not the case.\" \"If there is no expectation of any loss or gain, what is the need for You to work? Because if you don’t do any work, you will attain a specific do:sha (defect). When there is a do:sha (defect), you will incur a sin. If there is a sin upon you, you will enter hell. In hell, you will see the pains of punishment from Yama. Because of the desire to avoid hell, one must fulfill their responsibilities.\"\nHowever, it is said You are the cause for the existence of all the forces of Nature. Veda (ancient sacred texts) says they work because of You.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbhi:sha:sma:d va:thah pavathe: bhi:sho:de:thi su:ryaha\nbhi:sha:sma:d agnishcha indrascha mryuthyurda:vathi panchama ithi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOut of fear of Him, the wind blows; out of fear, the sun rises; out of fear, fire and Indra act; and death, the fifth, runs.\n-----------------------------------------------\nVeda (ancient sacred texts) says so. Out of fear of punishment from the Supreme for not doing their duties properly, va:thah pavathe: (air flows). Sun rises, fire always burns and rises high, water cools. We know these. bhi:sho:de:thi su:ryaha (the sun rises out of fear). Sun does not rise or set because of his greatness. bhi:sha: (out of fear), asma:th bhi:tha (from this fear) due to lack of alertness in the ordained duty, bhi:sho:de:thi su:ryaha (the sun rises out of fear). bhi:sha:sma:d agnischaindrascha (out of fear, fire and Indra). If fire is burning the way it should, the cause is the indwelling God. The fear of punishment. It is said that Indra manages all the de:vathas (divine administrative forces). Indra ensures all the forces of Nature are doing their responsibilities. He also works out of fear of punishment if he doesn’t work properly. Chathurmukha Brahma (the four-headed creator god), the four-headed eldest one, is the leader of all of them. Chathurmukha Brahma (the four-headed creator god) also fears death. His time frame is perhaps 100 years relative to his plane. It seems he has served for 50 years presently. He has 50 years more left. He is also supported by a divine power. That power is running him. Finally, death too works out of fear of the Supreme. mrythurdha:vathi panchama ithi (death runs as the fifth). Along with the four of them, he works properly out of fear of what will happen if he doesn’t. All of the forces of Nature work with discipline keeping in mind the timelines. This is what it is said about them. Then, for whose favor do You need to work? What’s there for You to lose if You don’t work?\nSwami answers: \"bhi:tha: (They are not working out of fear). They are working. Yes. All the worldly natural forces like air, heat, water, shade, trees, and everything, they work in discipline not out of the fear that you are thinking but out of another type of fear. The fear that you are thinking of is, you are saying that it is the fear of getting punished with some thorny stick if one does not work. Yes. [Arjuna said]. However, that is not the fear they have. All the worldly natural forces have full-blown faith and love for God. We don’t know. Can we know if a bird has love for God? We can’t because we don’t know their language and they don’t know ours. Language, expression, and way of working are all different. Everything is different. Not just a bird, any insect, animal or anything behave as per their limits and rules. Do you know why? Because they believe that they are part of God’s universal body and that they are serving It. They are with God. We don’t know this and think that they are ignorant of God. We know how to speak and also understand the meanings. Hence, we think we are worshiping God a lot using all the words that we know. In fact, we seek God to have our desires fulfilled. With a desire or hope that He would take away our pains. We don’t pray without seeking any desires. However, they perhaps have the knowledge of God’s help. They all fully love God and live in unison with God. Everything in Nature, a tree, a hill, or anything. They don’t ever go beyond their boundaries. This is not out of fear.\"\n\"The word bhi:sha: (out of fear) clearly indicates fear.\" \"Yes, but that fear is a different fear. It is that fear which results due to love. Worrying of a shutdown of emotion from the other side due to the slightest moment of separation. If someone loves another very deeply, they fear being away from them even for a moment. A child out of deep love for the mother cries out loudly the moment she puts him down. It is the sensitivity to separation, unable to bear it for even a moment. Such a quality is called sukuma:ram (delicate), too soft to handle separation. Because of soukuma:ryam (delicacy), and the immense love towards God’s auspicious qualities, they feel that if they ignore their work or do something wrong, having seen that, God will experience ‘pain’. Because if they don't do their work properly resulting in some loss to others, it seems it’s not the other person who experiences pain, it is God.\"\nWe hear about Rama. In Rama’s times, it seems everyone would practice their own dharma (duty/righteous conduct) very well. Why? Because of love for Rama. If they are proper, Rama will be happy. If Rama is happy, then they have life. If Rama is not happy, then they themselves don’t have a life. If Rama must be happy, they should fulfill their responsibilities. It seems even a cow gave milk to the calf for Rama. If it didn’t give milk to its calf, it will cry. If it cries, Rama will be unhappy. If Rama must be happy, the calf should be happy and healthy. If it should be happy and healthy, the cow should give milk to the calf. It seems the cow would give milk to the calf for Rama’s happiness. Anyone loving anyone else is also for the sake of Rama’s happiness. It is the fear of not being able to tolerate any kind of ‘distance’ from Rama. This is a fear that is out of love for Him. It is not a fear of punishment for not working. All forces of Nature have this kind of love for God. Observe Nature. Nothing violates their law except human beings. They don’t seek anything. They keep doing their work because God likes it. Trees yield fruit but do not ask back for any portion. Air gives prana (life force) to us but does not ask back for anything. They never ask. It is fear about God, not about punishment.\n\"Arjuna! Including mruthyu (death), all of them work properly. Why? Not out of fear that I will punish them or that I am behind them with a stick. This entire existence is My divine auspicious body. Due to immense outpouring love, they cannot tolerate any deficiency in it. They all work properly because they cannot tolerate any kind of pain on My face. I also work the same way to give that direction to them. Therefore, I don’t work for anyone’s praise. It’s not because I will incur any loss. It’s not because I desire anything. I work because everyone around Me should do well.\"\nIn verse 23, He says this:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyadi hyaham na varthe:yam ja:thu karmany athandrithaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf I were not to engage in action, ever vigilant...\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"If I don’t focus on what I do, others would think they are also exempt from being focused. There is a danger that they get spoiled because of that. I should work sincerely so they don’t get spoiled. That is why I also work. If I am also doing My work, why can’t you do yours?\"\nSwami is motivating Arjuna to take on his responsibility in the war to suppress the wrong-doers.\nJai Srimannarayana!\nVande: guru parampara:m"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe general characteristic of a human being is to imitate someone. This imitation attitude is generally used as an excuse for cutting down their work, getting excused from their duties, and looking for ways to avoid physical hard work. If someone is working sincerely, we don’t tend to take them as an example. However, if someone skips anything, we want to take him as an excuse to skip things. We don’t see imitation of good activities but most certainly see it with wrong deeds. We observe this in many people.\nWhen one intends the well-being of the world, even if not for themselves, to ensure others don’t face troubles or get spoiled because of them, they will need to follow the rules for the sake of their well-being. Let’s say someone knows a short-cut to get to a town. It’s a short-cut that basically cuts down a long route. He knows the ways through it, despite the path being a little difficult. There are some hard stones and thorns on the path. He protected his feet so he wouldn't get hurt by them. So, he moves forward. When there are others following him, he should keep a watch on them and move ahead, right?\nIf some people want to follow a person, the lead should realize what their options are, and their comfort is. We see at times how someone in a car ahead instructs other cars behind to follow him. However, if his car is a super high-speed one for the other cars to follow, what should he do? He should slow down to their pace and keep checking if they are following him. He should keep himself accessible to them. Just because his car is a super high-speed car, if he hits the road at the same pace, or if there is a signal and there are a number of directions to go through, what should he do? If he thinks others would hit a red signal, he should slow down so they don’t miss him. Once they have caught up, he should then take the lead again. That is when they can truly follow him. However, if he reaches ahead and goes past the junction, the others can end up missing the route. They could get confused, not knowing which direction to take. We know this.\nSimilarly, the shortcut path is full of thorns and stones. The lead has protection and he moves forward as per his pace. In such a case, others would reach comfortably on the other path even if it took longer. If he takes the others with him along that path on the basis that he is all protected, others would fall into a dangerous state hurting their feet with poking thorns and stones. It is always right to follow dharma (righteous conduct), especially when others are following you, for their sake.\nI am also similar. In chapter 3, Krishna is presenting Himself to Arjuna as an example for practicing one’s duties.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyadi hyaham na varthe:yam ja:thu karmany athandrithaha |\nmama varthma: nuvarthanthe: manushya:ha pa:rttha! sarvasaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFor if I did not engage in action, without being lazy, O Partha, all men would follow My path.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe says so in verse 23.\nmanushya:ha (human beings)\nWhat is to be observed here is manushya:ha (human beings). There are many species in the world: de:va (forces of nature), ma:nava (people), animal, stationary etc. He is not worried about de:va (forces of nature) type of species. He is not worried about animal species. He is also not worried about stationary species such as trees. They all live fine. It’s only the ma:nava (people) type.\nmanushya:ha pa:rttha! sarvasaha (O Partha, all human beings)\nThe danger is with human beings. They try to imitate so as to avoid [doing right things]. The rest of them follow the rules ordained for them. If you train animals of a bullock-cart on a path, you load it and it takes that exact path. Even if you try to side-track the cows and the bulls, they don’t yield. They go in the path that they are trained on. They don’t ever deroute. It’s not just animals or birds. All living beings do not compromise on their duties. They don’t work because someone is watching them or for the approval of someone else. They go on working as per their responsibilities.\nA human being is an exception. He always tends to cut short wherever and however much possible. He wants profits, but cuts down on hard work. He does not want to work long hours, but wants the results. This is the case only with human beings. That is why, it was also necessary to teach human beings about doing their duties properly.\nmanushya:ha pa:rttha! sarvasaha (O Partha, all human beings)\nThis is more essential for human beings. That is why I am having to teach. Swami says so presenting Himself.\nyadihi aham na varthe:yam (If I do not engage in action)\naham (I)\nWho is saying this? Sri Krishna Himself. Who is He? He is sarve:sware:swara (the Lord of the universe). He is the one who could create everyone in the world. He is sathyasankalpaha (He has the power to make resolutions that are actualised). Not only that, His sankalpa (resolution) is so powerful that susankalpa krutha jagadudaya vibhava laya li:laha (His resolution was the sole cause for the creative, functioning, and changing modes of the entire existence). He is the cause for pralaya (dissolution), srusti (creation), sthithi (sustenance). cchandatho: jagadupaka kruthi marthyaha (He can transform into any form if He wants to). He can become a human being, de:vatha (deity), animal, tree, stone or anything else. He has the power to become anything.\nDespite being supreme, all this is an act of compassion for the well-being and upliftment of others. Despite being such a supreme being, He follows regulations when He descends to this world or other worlds. We all know cricket. Wickets are placed on either side of the pitch. There are players on either side. They are all playing. If there is a player who bought the wickets, owns the ground and he says, \"As a bowler, I will just run to the wickets and smash them with the ball.\" Does it become an accepted move? The ground may belong to him. He may be the sponsor of all the wickets. He may be the one who organized the match. Yet, once the match is on, the players on either side must play as per the rules of the match. \"I will play the way I like because I own all of these. Why should I throw the ball this way? I will just go there and hit it straight onto that.\" It’s not allowed to say that. When rules are set out, it’s important to follow them.\n\"I have set some rules for this nature to support upliftment of souls. Even when I come to this nature for the sake of their upliftment, despite having no need, I follow the rules of nature without any deviation or compromise. That is why, He says aham (I).\"\nObserve what my stature is. Also, observe how I am conducting Myself. Where was I born? I was born in Vasudeva’s family. What kind of person is Vasudeva? His fortune is so great that God Himself was born as his son. It implies how great his practices and engagements are. Otherwise, why would He arrive in his family? He is a great soul who performed great thapas (penance) not just in this birth but also many before. He is someone who attained the grace of God. Therefore, Vasudeva also was a sistajana agre:saraha (authoritative and the most revered among authentic practicing scholars). He is also a sistaja agre:sara (foremost among the disciplined). I was born in such a person’s family. Hence, whatever the practices and engagements are in that family, I am also following them.\nathandrithaha (without being lazy)\nthath kulo:chitha karmani athandrithaha (without being lazy in the duties appropriate to that family)\nHe is the son of Vasudeva. Yes. What are all the rules in such a setting? I followed all those. As a son of Nandagopa, what are the rules there? I followed all those. To take the cows for grazing, calves for grazing, collect cow dung, make cow dung cakes. All other relevant work including cutting grass, feeding animals, giving them a bath. Milking them, guarding butter, etc. I have done all that work. Why? Wherever I am born, whatever rules there are, it’s My responsibility to practice them. If I am teaching everyone that this is the responsibility, how can I not follow it? So, even if it is Me…\nyadi hyaham na varthe:yam (If I do not engage in action)\nIf I with regard to my responsibilities, ja:thu karmani athandrithaha (do not practice the ordained responsibilities) athandrithaha (with great care), mama varthma: nuvarthanthe: (others will also follow our path). Especially because it’s human beings. It’s not the case with these times, it’s always been the case. Not just in this birth, in any birth. When I was born as Rama, I became a human being. I thought of living like a human being, so I practiced all the dharma (righteous conduct) that a human being must, without any deviation or compromise. I have become sa:lagra:ma sila (a sacred stone). Whatever rules are there for a sila (stone), I keep practicing all those. I have become a vara:ha (boar). Whatever food that a boar eats, I will eat the same. It will eat only certain thunga mustha/dumpa (roots). I will eat the same. As long as I am in that form, I will abide by the related rules. I will not violate any single rule of nature. When I Myself am not violating them, what should you be doing? So, you must also work as per your responsibilities.\nIn fact [for grammatical correctness] He should have said varthe:ya:. He said varthe:yam. We refer to this as a:rsha prayo:gam (the usage of a certain qualified one). Meaning, there is no fault in it.\nWho is He telling this to? Pa:rttha! (Meaning the son of Pritha). Who is Pritha? It’s Kunthi Devi. Kunthi Devi never ignored her duties. Post her husband’s death, she took the responsibility of raising her kids carefully and properly. As a mother, she raised both her kids and Madri’s children. She was fine with as many difficulties as she might encounter. She in fact asked for that.\nvipadassanthunasyasvath thathra thathra jagadguro:h (Hey Bhagavan! Your protection is key for me.)\nHey Bhagavan! Your protection is key for me. As long as you are protecting us, we won’t abandon our duties despite losses or hardships. If luxuries are going to make me forget my duties, then I don’t want them. Let there be painful times. You are born to her.\nPa:rttha! (O son of Pritha!)\nIf you fight and hit them with arrows, there could be some loss or pain. You are thinking about pain or loss when you fight and hit them with arrows! Why do you now speak of backing off from the war thinking of loss and pain, happiness and sadness? At least for having been born in her womb, there is a need for you to carry out your duties properly. Get up and prepare yourself for fulfilling your responsibility, the war.\nSaying so in chapter 3, Sri Krishna is making Arjuna duty-oriented.\nVande: guru parampara:m\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\n(I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nPeople desiring goodness, people wishing to follow Elders – such people lived in those days. Such people live in these days too. Some people look for ways to escape their duties and simply roam around. Instead of following Elders, some people look for ways to use them where possible to escape duties. Such people existed in those days and exist today too. A human being is a human being. Remember, there was some song in Telugu… “Outfits have changed, language of speech has changed…yet man has not changed!” The same behaviors during the times of Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu also prevailed in the times of Lord’s incarnation as Rama and as Krishna, and in Kali Yuga too.\nThe only difference is that back then, the leaders and guides attempted to correct people immediately. Also, people tried to take the feedback and correct themselves quickly. However, as time progressed, people became more adamant. Now, they do only what they like, and abandon anything they don’t like. They tend to act as if they are listening when being addressed to change. Or they leave not wanting to listen. Or they say something but think differently. All these behaviors have grown stronger in Kali Yuga, though humans remain the same.\nThat is why, Sri Krishna says in chapter 3, verse 23…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmama varthma anuvarthanthe:\nmanushya:h pa:rttha! sarvasaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nO Partha (Arjuna)! Human beings follow My path in all respects.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is specific about human beings. He did not find any trouble with the other species. All other species do their work properly. It’s only human beings who don’t.\nanuvarthanthe: (are following Me)\nHe used present tense. In fact, He should have said that ‘if He didn’t do it’…\nmama varthma anuvarthe:ran manushya:h (if I didn't do it, they will follow Me)\nanuvarthe:ran (will follow Me)\n“If I don’t do it, they will also not do it.” This is how we say it generally, isn’t it? That’s not how He said it. He said “they are continuing to stop doing [their duties if He doesn’t do His].” What it means is that they have been following Him. The same goes for the time when He was stating it, and today as we are discussing it. Human beings are always human beings. That is why, there must always be an inspiration for human beings. Inspiration must continue to come from shastra (scriptures) and the gurus (teachers) who teach it. The two are like the bunds that keep the flow of water in the intended direction. The stronger the embankment, the more proper is the reach of water to its destination. If either of them are weak, that water becomes unusable.\nLet water represent our shraddha (interest). Following shastra (scriptures) is represented on one side. Listening and following the words of those gurus (teachers) who practice shastra (scriptures) is on the other side. Both of these together must guide us. Those gurus (teachers) who reject shastra (scriptures) do not benefit us. Reading scriptures alone without the guidance of a guru (teacher) will not give us clarity on the subject. We don’t need to think that the mahanubhavas (great beings) are only in the human form teaching us. We have earlier heard from the scriptures like Srimad Bhagavatam that say… An avadhuta (one in high spiritual state), being an exceptional jnani (learned one), tells king Yadu… “I have 24 gurus (teachers) in this entire nature.” It is the responsibility of everyone to receive good knowledge from wherever and whenever it comes. Seek refuge of an acharya (spiritual teacher) and move forward. However, wherever you find good knowledge, imbibe it. As long as it does not contradict with the good you have earlier heard and seen, there is no harm in practicing it. However, human beings tend to follow wrong doings rather than right practices.\nDevatas (divine administrative forces of God) keep protecting us. Some may wonder - if devatas (divine administrative forces of God) are protecting us, why won’t they warn us before we make a mistake? If they warn us ahead, we won’t ever even commit mistakes. Isn’t it? Why wait until we make a mistake and then punish us? Why let one make a mistake and then punish? We know some make it a point to let someone make accounting mistake and then catch it. Why make them commit that mistake and then punish them? In fact, they don’t make them do it. When there is a behavior in someone that makes them commit a mistake, they try to correct that behavior through a suitable punishment. The same goes for good behavior as well.\nShastra (scriptures) says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna de:va:ha ishtima:da:ya rakshanthi pasupa:lavath\nyamhi rakshithu micchanthi buddhya: samyo:jayanthi tham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe devas (divine forces) do not protect us by holding a stick like a cowherd.\nThose whom they wish to protect, they guide with wisdom.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDevatas (divine administrative forces of God) are daivi shaktis (divine energies). Everything in nature is divine energy. They will never confront us, standing holding a stick, warning that we will be killed. They don’t direct us to indicate that this is something we must do or not. They invoke a thought that it is the right thing to do through someone’s word or some situation.\nbuddhya: samyo:jayanthi (they invoke a thought)\nLet’s say we are setting forth for a journey and a cat shows up in front of you. It is also a divine incident. We must remember that it is a hint from devatas (divine administrative forces of God) indicating a possible trouble from what you set out to do. We cannot get angry on the carrier of the omen if it is a bad one. Another common bad omen is a single Brahmin (a priest or learned person) approaching as you set out on a task. You must not get upset and blame him that he is the cause for the possibility of a bad outcome. There is always a reason for all unplanned incidents. We must remember that they are situations in nature that occurred to teach something to us. Accordingly, we must decide what to do but not reprimand the external carrier. If rain-bearing clouds emerge when you set out to travel, do you get upset with them? You must plan based on the possibility that it will rain and you will get wet. Perhaps you must plan accordingly so you don’t get drenched. It does not mean you must cancel the trip thinking it as a bad omen. It is indicating something would happen. Accordingly, be prepared for that. It is necessary to behave accordingly. That is why, they all indicate - even God is the same way. However, in the case of Arjuna, He is having to not only indicate but communicate verbally.\nmama varthma anuvarthanthe: (they follow My path)\nIf I don’t behave properly, all of them will follow Me. “So!? What happens to them if they follow You? Nothing is happening to You.” Because I am capable, I can tolerate whatever results. How about you? A doctor goes to a patient to treat some infection. He can take care of himself using sanitizers, medication or something else. If you say that you will also go amidst the patients because the doctor is visiting them… These days, all of this has become very essential. If he doesn’t use a mask, why should I? People are speaking of new variants such as omicron. Everyone is moving around freely, even pushing each other, without any caution. Responsible authorities are giving direction to maintain 2 yards, 6 feet, between people. Keep conscious of covering, and sanitizing. You might say that others are not following, but you don’t know the protection mechanism for them. Remember that none of them will come to protect. We must ourselves do all that’s important for what we are assigned to prevent problems. We tend to make excuses in order to disobey, not to follow. Someone may be following the rules, but we don’t tend to follow them. That is why, Sri Krishna is warning.\nutsideyurime lokaha (people will be spoiled)\nChapter 3, verse 24.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nuthside:yur ime: lo:ka:ha na kurya:m karma che:d aham |\nsankarasya cha kartha: sya:m upahanya:m ima:h praja:ha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf I do not perform action, these worlds would perish. I would be the cause of confusion (sankara) and would destroy these beings.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf I don’t work, I would become the cause for putting everyone in trouble. Why? Because they follow Me. They are refusing to follow if I don’t follow.\nutsideyuhu ime:lokaha (people will be spoiled if I don’t work). What happens then?\nsankarasya cha kartha: syam (I would become the cause for mix-up)\nHe will stop doing his work. He will adopt something that’s not necessary for him. There is compromise on quality in both aspects now. In the past, there was a boom time for computer skills. Some doctors and lawyers gave up on what they worked hard on for 15 years. They switched over to that profession and planned to make quick, big profits. What ultimately happened? When it was time to test for proper skills at work, all of them were rejected and had to go back to their paths. Quality will be compromised in both areas.\nsankarasya cha kartha: syam (I would become the cause for mix-up)\nThat’s the danger of following someone. This will cause mix-up and result in loss of essence, i.e. dilution increases.\nupahanyam imah prajah (I will become the cause for all the troubles that they will face)\nThat’s not right. Hence, we must recognize what the rule is. It is to carry out responsibilities. Work with focus. This is very essential for humans. It is mandatory. Firstly, it is difficult to attain birth as a human being. If we don’t do what we are supposed to, how do we know when we will get this again? We must not slip from where we are because we abuse the opportunity that’s with us. The body is not permanent anyway. It is a surety that this will disintegrate. No one knows where we will be taken to after this disintegrates. We must never opt to fall from where we are. Always try to move upwards. Despite having to work hard, regardless if it results in a sense of pleasure or pain, happiness or sadness, stopping to do your duties is not permitted. You must do them. Sri Krishna is warning Arjuna for the sake of society’s well being.\nVande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nWe begin with a prayer:\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m lo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham (I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nIn Chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita, encouraging Arjuna for war, Sri Krishna clarifies to him the necessity of fulfilling responsibilities. Whoever it may be, irrespective of whether he likes it or not, one must not attempt to escape from any ordained responsibility. It’s not related to our likes and dislikes. They are prescribed, and thus one must practice them. When it is anyway inevitable, then do it with interest, love, and as service to God. This is what Sri Krishna is instructing in summary. He is accordingly encouraging Arjuna and says, in verse 24:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nuthside:yur ime: lo:ka:ha\nna kurya:m karma che:daham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf I don’t fulfill My responsibilities, these worlds would be ruined.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDespite being in this position, if I don’t fulfill My responsibilities, they will follow suit and will suffer consequences. They will try to follow the path without the ability to walk through it. Sri Krishna was disappointed with Balarama in this aspect. Before the onset of war, Balarama said he wouldn't take part in the war. He said, “Duryodhana is my student, and you are on the side of Pandavas.” “Victory for the Pandavas is certain when You are on their side. The other side will lose.” “I cannot watch my student lose. So, I won’t take part in the war. I will leave.” He went off on a pilgrimage.\nIt is not his responsibility to go off on a pilgrimage. [Sri Krishna thought] “If that’s the case, I would have also taken off the same way.” Why am I sitting through the war? Why am I having to take the side of the Pandavas? It is dharma (righteous practice) to take the better side between the parties. In time of elections, most politicians are not the best suitable. Who do we vote for? Some may say that they refuse to vote. This is not right. Even if there is no one fully suitable, it is our responsibility to choose the best among them. If one is wise and can make a good choice, has the time and the chance to cast a vote but does not do it, all the others not capable of selecting the right candidate will cast votes and elect someone incapable. When you have a chance, you must take it to select someone who is best amongst the lot.\nSri Krishna looked to see who He can grace Bhagavad Gita instruction upon. There were many eligible ones. However, when He examined who is best amongst them, it was Arjuna. The rest indulged in various activities. Some due to selfishness and some out of arrogance. Some due to thinking that they are highly devoted to God. Some due to thinking that they are highly knowledgeable. No one either approached Sri Krishna or sought His guidance. Krishna made various attempts with them hoping they might realize and change. Right at birth, He revealed to His parents His greatness. They didn’t ask Him to teach anything. He was born with four hands. He was adorned with all the ornaments at birth. His father eulogized:\nja:tho:si de:va de:ve:sa sanka chakra gada:dhara (You are born, O Lord of all gods, bearing conch, discus, and mace)\nHowever, he never asked Him to give any upadesha (spiritual guidance) for his upliftment. So, they didn’t ask. Sri Krishna directed His father to take Him to the other side. The people here [Mathura] think they are all ‘educated’. At least maybe those who are not ‘educated’ will ask, He thought. Accordingly, He asked to be taken to Gokulam. He tried for 15 years with them. He displayed all types of powers. He thought at least they would ask Him but they didn’t. Disappointment.\nHe returned to Mathura. He struck Kamsa and the rest. He released Ugrasena and others from the jail. No one asked Him there either. They stayed silent because they got the kingdom. They kept quiet because they were relieved from difficulties. Everyone took shelter of their comforts. He thought He would try with the intellectual and wise. He reached Sandipa. Despite being a great person, Sandipa only asked for his lost sons to be restored. Sri Krishna thought He would be asked to grace guiding words for his upliftment. He wasn’t. What else could He do? He looked around everywhere. He couldn’t find any eligible person who had the desire to uplift themselves. Yet, He didn’t get disappointed. He tried.\nHe found that Pandavas are relatively more eligible amongst the rest. He got closer to them. He provided them with many kinds of support. He thought at least they would seek Him, but they didn’t. They thought they knew everything, just like how everyone else thought. Finally, as a result of many attempts, Arjuna said:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsishyasthe:ham sa:dhi:ma:m thva:m prapannam\nthad vada yath nischitham sya:th sre:yaha ithi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI am your disciple, surrendered to you; please instruct me on what is definitely good for me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe found one person who asked Him what He believes is sreyas (the right thing to do). He felt that there was at least one, and that it was enough for this lifetime. He started preaching to him. It’s not permitted to be disappointed. It’s not permitted to declare that everyone is bad. We must carry out our responsibility and use our abilities. We must use the right. We must never say that we will not cast a vote because all the candidates are unfit. Whoever is better amongst existing applicants – when everyone is a devil, it is the quality of a wise person to select the ‘good’ devil.\n“Hey Arjuna! That is why I am working with you.” My brother Balarama said he doesn’t want anything out of this and left in the name of pilgrimage. Okay. However, how should one behave when on a pilgrimage? Like a sadhu (saint). He should be like a saint – righteous, renouncing, humble, obedient. Was he like that? How can he say he was on a pilgrimage without all of those qualities? Didn’t he have those qualities? Let’s see!\nHe went straight to Naimisaranya as the first stop. At Naimisaranya, there is a great being, Romaharshana, a direct disciple of the renowned sage, Vedavyasa. While being chaturdhvarnasya (of the four castes), he is the best jnani (knowledgeable person). The guru instructed him to be the leading acharya (teacher) for Pauranika Shastra (scriptures of ancient stories), forever fresh and forever appropriate pastimes. He was preaching the literature of the Puranas (ancient stories) to all those gathered there. While preaching, “I am the preacher, you are the listener.” “I am knowledgeable, you are ignorant.” “I am the guru, you are the disciple.” The preacher should never feel that way. He should feel his acharya (teacher) is preaching to him and teach the same while attending as a listener. Romaharshana is a wise one. He is worthy, fully capable. He was giving a discourse on Puranas seated in the position of the preacher. Sages like Shaunaka and others were happily listening. The preacher believes that his teacher is within him and instructs through him to the audience. He should not preach on the basis of his physical ability. With the same feeling, he sat on Vyasan (seat of Vyasa), taking his position, and started preaching.\nBalarama reached there. As he is Sri Krishna’s brother, everyone stood up out of respect. Romaharshana, though, did not stand up because he was sitting on the Vyasan (seat of Vyasa). Not because of arrogance but because of the glory of his position. However, for the one who was set out to pilgrimage, [Balarama] felt that despite him having reached there, while all the superior brahmanas (priests) rose, “You are after all a shudra (from the fourth caste)! I am Balarama, the brother of Sri Krishna!” “You won’t stand to offer respect?! See what I will do to you!” He hit him! Balarama is the strong one who taught Duryodhana how to fight. Romaharshana lost his life because of that one hit. Balarama accrued the brahmahatya dosha (sin of killing the highest). He accrued the sin of hurting a great being. He carried the sin of humiliating the position. He accrued these many sins. He took on a responsibility that was not his. He thought he should fulfill it. Therefore, neither could he fulfill his own responsibility, nor what he took upon himself. He failed at both. na ghar ka na ghat ka (neither belonged to home, nor to the pier). That’s what happened to Balarama that day. He had to perform atonement. He had to perform expiation for the sin of brahmahatya (killing the highest). He had to perform atonement for the humiliation he did. That is history.\nThe reason we are recollecting this is that Sri Krishna had tremendous dissatisfaction with Balarama. Though his own brother, Balarama ignored his prescribed duty. Arjuna! Don’t commit such sin. It is your responsibility to fight in the war. Do it well. Your brother is Dharmaraja. However, he is titled Yudhishthira. Do you know why? Just as you do, don’t you think he realizes Bhishma and Drona are your gurus? Bhishma is not only guru, but also grandfather. Don’t you think your brother Yudhishthira realizes that they are elders? And the others present are relatives? Why is he participating in the war then? He is not throwing down his weapons and saying that he would go beg for alms. Yudhi + sthira (firm in war)! He is one who recognized his duty, and so he stood firm on it. Yuddha (war) does not necessarily just mean killing everyone. It is to exercise one’s responsibility, regulating wrong-doings and encouraging righteous acts. This is the purpose of that war.\nBhishmacharya is even greater than him. Don’t you think he knows what dharma (righteous acts) are? Doesn’t he know that Duryodhana and others are committing a mistake? Doesn’t he know that Dhritarashtra is committing a mistake? Doesn’t he know that you are all good people? Doesn’t he know who I am? Yet, he is with the other side of the war? He is tied to dharma (righteous practice). He knows his responsibility. He took a vow when he was young. He said he would support and protect whoever is on the throne of Kuru. On the banks of river Ganga, he took a vow at a young age in the presence of his father, Shantanu. It was that he would never desire the kingdom. “I will give away the kingdom to whoever she [queen of Kuru dynasty] gives birth to. However, I will stand guard for the throne.” Because he took this vow, Dhritarashtra ended up taking the throne. Due to the weakness of Dhritarashtra, his son Duryodhana ended up ruling the kingdom. He made the vow. Hence, no matter who took the throne, whoever was ruling, he had to take their side despite their unjust reign. Yet, it’s against his duties to punish any righteous people. Hence, he said he will not hurt the Pandavas. He told Duryodhana that he would take care of the rest. Duryodhana was pleased with this. Why? It’s just those five Pandavas. There are so many of us, like Karna. We will take care of them. Take care of the rest of the army [Duryodhana said to Bhishmacharya]. Bhishmacharya knows dharma (righteous practice) and he knows his duty.\nArjuna! Don’t give up on your responsibilities. You should never become the reason for disturbing the order of the world. upahanyam imah prajah (these people would be ruined). If I don’t do my duty, this world will turn bad. Hence, I practice my responsibilities. Bhishma and others do too. Your brother also is practicing. What happened to you? In fact, you are not even as knowledgeable as your brother. Because your brother at least knows that one must do what ought to be done. However, you have the desire for kingdom, happiness, etc. In such a case, how can you abandon responsibility? That is not allowed. Orient towards responsibilities and move forward. Sri Krishna is taking Arjuna ahead, and all of us too. Let us also follow rules, practice responsibilities, and move ahead.\nVande Guru Paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBhagavad Gita materialized to mend people toward a right path. On the auspicious `ma:rgasi:rsha sukla e:ka:dasi` (11th day of the waxing moon in Margasira month), Sri Krishna’s `upade:sa` (teachings) ‘saw’ the world. He graced the `upade:sa` (teachings) in the beginning of the `ma:rgasi:rsha` (Margasira) month. However, the `upade:sa` (teachings) did not ‘see’ the world on that day. It was just the two: He, the teacher, and Arjuna, the listener. Everyone else was there simply as statues. Sanjaya was observing everything. Dhritarashtra asked him on the 11th day from the onset of the war, “Did Bhishmacharya fall? Why?” “Both the Pandavas and Kauravas like Bhishma. Neither wish his demise.” “What were they doing when he was collapsing?” `kim akurvatha: sanjaya!` (What did they do, Sanjaya!) Bhishmacharya fell on the 11th day of the war. Sanjaya was the one who saw everything that happened. He recollected it all. He conveyed it to Dhritarashtra and presented it to the world through him. That is why, it is said that `ma:rgasi:rsha sukla e:ka:dasi` (11th day of the waxing moon in Margasira month) is the appearance day of Bhagavad Gita. Gita Jayanthi is celebrated that day.\nIn Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna reminds us of our responsibilities. Why? Because we all must progress. Who does ‘we’ mean? The entire human race. Irrespective of caste, color, race, or religion, it is essential that everyone performs their duties. Exercising one’s own responsibility is essential for the benefit of the world. It is referred to as `lo:ka sangraha` (efforts that are carried out because they are good for the world).\nSo, how should one exercise one’s responsibilities? One may be learning and another may have attained `siddhi` (perfection/result). Those in the learning mode do their responsibilities with the right focus following regulations. Those who attained `siddhi` (perfection/result) may not have the compulsion to perform them. However, they also must carry them out in the same way to teach those in the initial stage. Sri Krishna explains this very clearly in chapter 3, verse 25.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsaktha:ha karmani avidva:msaha yattha: kurvanthi bha:ratha! |\nkurya:th vidva:n thattha::sakthaha chiki:rshuhu lo:ka sangraham ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nJust as the ignorant, attached to their actions, perform them, O Bharata, so should the wise perform, without attachment, desiring the well-being of the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\n`lo:ka sangraha` (with the desire for the well-being of people around). He also must practice it for their well-being. How should they practice? Those in the initial stage perform their responsibilities with a desire for results. The `siddhis` (perfected ones), however, need not focus on results as they already have the result in hand. `asakthaha` (without attachment). Yet… `kurya:th vidva:n api` (the wise one must also perform). He is very knowledgeable, i.e., `jna:ni` (a knowledgeable person). Yet he must also `kurya:th` (perform). How should he perform? `avidva:msaha yattha: kurvanthi` (the way those who do not have exceptional knowledge perform their responsibilities). How do they perform? They perform `karma` (actions) with a desire for the result. `saktha:ha karmani` (interested in actions).\nYou want to teach a child how to write letters. You know them well, but he doesn’t know at all. What do we do in such a case? We must teach him how to sit. Sit with folded legs. He must hold the slate on his lap, must hold the pen/pencil/chalk in one hand. Then, we must make him write as they should be written. Should we say, “We should let them write the way they are habituated to”? When he holds the slate and scribbles on it the way he wants and if we praise that act, he will only know how to scribble. He won’t learn the alphabet. Since we know how to write, if we simply write standing in whatever position, what about him? He will need to learn now. What should you do? You must first sit properly. Observing you, he will sit down. You must properly hold the chalk. Watching you, he will hold it. Now, you must write properly. He will imitate you and write. Despite not having a need to do so, you write without desiring any specific result. You are writing because you must teach him, ultimately wishing for his `hitham` (well-being). For him, it’s not well-being. He needs to learn the alphabet. He needs to learn to focus. He wants results. He is an `avidva:msa` (not knowledgeable), and one desiring results. Both of those do not apply to you. Yet, do it for his growth. Then, he will also gradually get habituated. We are familiar with this kind of state in the world. “Arjuna! We also must do the same if we desire the well-being of the world.”\nWhen doing any work, there is the temporary worldly result. Additionally, we must also attain the benefit of human birth when doing that work. What is the purpose of birth as a human being? Let’s think. There are many crores of species. There are human beings. What is the unique quality of human beings? The rest are all eating, moving, giving birth to offspring, leaving, sleeping, feeling scared, etc. Every living entity is doing these. What is the one exclusive quality that a human being must have? Human beings are wearing clothes when compared to others. He is also doing many additional activities. What is the extra quality that human beings must have to be able to do all the extra activities? Which quality should human beings possess? We are human beings but we can’t seem to say it. `Sa:sthras` (scriptures) clarify. To conduct in a way that you do not get tied to the bondage of `karma` (actions) again. This is what a human being must do.\nThis body is not the first. There were thousands, lakhs, and crores that have been formed. Many more will get formed. While this is happening, it is not necessary that one will attain a [human] birth. This `ji:va` (soul) is in human life today. Not sure what life he was in before or what life he will be in tomorrow. Not knowing if he will go higher or lower. However, the lineage of lives will go on. The goal is not to get rid of the body. That is called death. The goal is not to get rid of the body, but to get rid of the cause for the bodies. What is that? `karma bandha` (bondage of actions). What should be gotten rid of? `Karma bandha` (bondage of actions). If that’s gone, we can do what we want to. If weeds are growing, the root is the cause for it. It’s not the weed that we get rid of, it’s weed’s root that needs to be removed. `Karma` (actions) is the root for the formation of bodies. Therefore, the bond with `karma` (actions) must be cut. A human being should have the desire for freedom from the bond with `karma` (actions). One with that desire is known as `mumukshu` (one who desires liberation). The essential human quality one must possess is `mumukshutha` (desire for liberation) - ‘I want liberation from the bond with these `karmas` (actions)’. It’s not liberation from responsibilities. It’s liberation from `karma bandha` (bondage of actions).\nHow does one get liberated? The purpose of the body is that. The opportunity to get rid of the accumulated stocks of all `karma` (actions) is available only through this body. So, use it properly while you have it. If it is said that this opportunity lasts while you have [the body], you shouldn’t waste even a second. Right? Therefore, constantly do what you should do to get rid of `karma` (actions). That is, surrender to God. To submit to God. There are certain responsibilities that come with the body. While fulfilling these responsibilities, work with the desire to use everything for Him because they are given by Him. It may be any job. Perhaps shoe-making. Or cultivating a farm for someone. For someone else, it may be cooking, or cleaning. It could be to tie up things, or mold other things. It doesn’t matter what the work is. Whatever is ordained, it should be done as a service to the One who has given it. That work will not only not attach to you, but also be useful to get rid of existing stock. You must do your work backed by that knowledge. This is what a `mumukshu` (one who desires liberation) must do.\nWhat happens then? It will be with you all the while that you have the current body. After the current body is shed, since there is no more stock of `karma` (actions), one will not need to take any other body, and will ultimately reach his intended goal. This is the purpose of human life. Why are we speaking about this? We should not think that shedding the body is the solution to everything. `Upanishads` (ancient sacred texts) give out a wonderful `upade:sa` (teaching) called `Pancha:gni Vidya` (knowledge of the five fires). It is a secret that modern science has not yet discovered. It elaborates the journey [of soul] from the time he leaves a body to the time he takes up another. It properly explains why he travels. After leaving the current body, where does he go? How does he go? How does he return to Earth? How does he transform into food? How does he enter the body of a human being? How does he take the form of a cell? How does he take the form of a baby? How is he reborn? He could be born as a human being, animal, bird, tree or anything else. There is a complete description of how he arrives. It is named `Pancha:gni Vidya` (knowledge of the five fires). What is the driving cause for it? It is the stock of `karma` (actions). We don’t know where it is or how it is. God knows it. Hence, you must depend on Him as you work. He promised he would get rid of the bond with `karma` (actions). If you believe in Me and seek Me, I will eliminate your bond with `karma` (actions).\n`Upanishad` (ancient sacred text) states, ‘to focus your feelings on Him is called `Upa:sana` (worship/meditation), or `Ve:danam` (knowledge/understanding), or `Bhakthi` (devotion)’. Whoever performs `upa:sana` (worship/meditation) this way, their `karma` (actions) will be burnt like cotton feathers in intense fire. Cotton feathers are the tiniest pieces. If placed into a blazing fire, `yada: ishi:ka thu:lam agno:pro:tham pradu:yatha:` (just as cotton fibers thrown into a blazing fire are burnt). They disintegrate to a level that can’t be seen by the eyes. Similarly, the pile of past sins attached to that soul will be removed because of His affect. The chance of liberation is achieved through `upa:sana` (worship/meditation). Only a human being is fit to do `Upa:sana` (worship/meditation). No other species. The purpose of human life is this. If we don’t utilize it for that purpose, we are destroying a golden opportunity within our hands. That should not happen. This is Krishna’s `thapana` (worry/concern).\nSomeone who has the desire, however, without knowledge - is `mumukshatha` (desire for liberation). He is not yet mature. We should never lead them in the wrong direction. If he must go in the right path, the knowledgeable and wise must lead that path by example. He will watch them and follow. Both should do the same thing. There is only one difference. That person won’t leave the result. This person won’t desire the result. Work is the same for both. This is what He is saying. `saktha:ha karmani` (He’s interested to work). He is not knowledgeable and is not mature in the quality of `mumukshatha` (desire for liberation). However, he must do it. You, being knowledgeable, `thada: vidwa:n kurya:th` (then the wise one should perform properly). But `asakthaha` (without focus on the outcome). Why should I do it when I don’t need to? Why do I care what happens to the other person? If he gets spoiled because he imitated you, you will accrue a big share of sin that he gets because you are the cause. You will also ‘fall’. You fall whilst believing that you are knowledgeable. Let that not happen. Sri Krishna details how a wise one must conduct himself for the purpose of rest of the society. Teaching this in verse 25, Sri Krishna takes Arjuna ahead.\nBelieve in Bhagavad Gita as a life-enhancer; let us all learn it with proper focus and understanding.\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nBhagavad Gita is a Vedanta grantha (scripture on the essence from Vedas). Generally, most people think Vedanta establishes the world, and life, as illusionary. However, Vedanta is not stating that the world and life are illusionary. It teaches us about the responsibilities we have in this world. People who don’t know about it say that Vedanta makes a person powerless and inactive. However, in fact, Vedanta Shastra (scripture of Vedanta) has what makes a person rightly active, and it does so. Bhagavad Ramanujacharya Swami clarifies this topic properly as he puts forth Sri Krishna’s opinion for us. Chapter 3 is a good example. Arjuna does not want to wage war and sits back. Sri Krishna encourages him to fight in the war… He teaches him that if he desires the well-being of the world, he must perform his duty. He gave Himself as an example. He also provides examples of great beings while telling him the way to carry out responsibilities.\nThere is only one difference. What is it? One who is knowledgeable gives up the attachment with results. He performs his duties. However, one who is not knowledgeable gives up performing duties but hopes for results. This is dangerous. You want the result but you do not work. How can that be possible? Nowhere in shastra (scripture) it is mentioned to relinquish karma (actions/duties).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkurvanne:va iha karma:ni jiji:vise:th sathagum sama:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne should desire to live for a hundred years, only by performing actions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nUpanishad clearly orders.\nkurvan e:va (continue to keep fulfilling your duties)\nHowever, what is the way you must do it?\nthyakthe:na bunji:tha (you must have the spirit of tyaga, renunciation)\nGenerally, when people hear the word ‘tyaga’ (renunciation), they assume it’s about renouncing karma (work). However, it is never mentioned anywhere in shastra (scripture) to renounce karma (actions/duties). It recommends renouncing some kinds of karma (actions/duties) - nishiddha karmas (forbidden activities). These are those which harm the world. Karmas (actions/duties) are categorized into two: ordained duties and prohibited activities. Whatever is prohibited, one should not do. Ordained duties, one must not relinquish. It does not matter if the person is jnani (knowledgeable), or... pandit (scholar), upasaka (worshiper), bhakta (devotee), or a self-realized one! No one is allowed to relinquish karma (actions/duties).\nHowever, what else can he relinquish? He can relinquish the results of the karma (actions/duties). Renunciation should happen in the heart, not at physical level. You must keep working on the physical level but not have a desire for it in the heart. This is the only difference.\nWhen we were young, we learned a skill called shorthand… There was a teacher who taught shorthand. He could write 140 words per minute. There are certain speed levels. Such as 80 words / min, 100 words / min, 120 words / min. 140 words / minute is considered a high speed. The master is an expert in it. When writing shorthand, one uses strokes. Every word has a certain stroke combination. For the word ‘brighter’, there is a stroke that will read as brighter. Or strokes that read out “bright-er.” Despite being highly skillful, he could write the strokes in longer format. While teaching too, he explained at that level on how to write it. Students would ask for shortcuts saying there is a single stroke instead of many. That is not useful at this point of learning. Once your hand gets used to the turns and twists of the strokes, then it’s okay to think about trying advanced strokes. You cannot think of shortcuts in the earlier stages. He mandated everyone to write full length strokes. Only then, one would receive a passing grade. If we show one shortcut in one place, he would learn ten other shortcuts. If that happens, the functioning system gets corrupted.\nIn farming, there are two types. One is the laborer's type and the other owner’s type. In the laborer’s type, the laborer has set timings. He has a set time to reach and start work.. “I need to step into the field at 9:00am. These days, it’s 9:00am.” Earlier it’s early hours. They have official hours that start after breakfast. He needs a coffee break at 11:00am for 15-20 mins. Next comes lunch at 1:00pm for 40-45 mins. Later at 5:00pm, they leave the plow wherever they are. Nowadays, it’s all tractors, not manual. If it’s the owner, would he do it the same way? Because it’s his farm, he arrives in the early hours. He watches everything properly and works carefully. He tries to ensure he gets the best results. If needed, he skips lunch or snacks. He doesn’t even think of them. He wants the work to be done properly. Because it’s his work. His focus is only on that. This is the owner's way of working. The level of focus when an owner works on the task, ensuring nothing is put at risk… Ensuring every minute detail is paid attention to… Everyone must work in the same way in life as well. Despite being intelligent and having everything… You must do things properly, as it is necessary to teach others to reach the same state. Otherwise, if you don’t, and others take you as an example to avoid their work, yield suffers. When yield is low, the land is under-utilized. In that case, overall productivity declines. That results in an overall difficult state for everyone. The cause was that you did not do your own work. Hence, you will surely end up paying your part of the resulting effects despite thinking of your great success in many things. Because the impact of it is on you, the benefits of good deeds you did also gradually come down. Because you quit doing your work, thinking you have acquired jnana (knowledge)… And become the reason for their knowledge-loss, you will experience bhrasthata (a fall/degradation).\nThere is a difference between falling down and coming down. We must remember the two words. If you want to rescue someone who has fallen into a pit, you can come down. You should not fall down. One who comes down will get down after making necessary arrangements to come back up. Hence, he will be able to pull up and save someone who has fallen. However, if he falls down, he not only fails to help the other come up, but he can’t come up either.. Leave alone that he can’t help one who has fallen, he won’t even be able to come up himself. He thought himself to be one who is above! One should not get into such a state.\nchiki:rshuhu lo:kasangraham (wishing for the well-being of the world)\n[Lord] says in verse 3.25 that it is very important to wish for everyone’s well-being. You can’t expect a case where everyone’s well-being is neglected with only you taken care of. It’s never that way. It’s always together with everyone. If a portion of the machine thinks “it doesn’t matter to me what happens to this small part of the machine…” The disturbance in the small part disturbs the neighboring part… That in turn disturbs the surrounding parts and the entire machine breaks down. We know this. Thus, no one is allowed to relinquish karma (actions/duties). Neither the wise nor the ignorant.\nPilots, despite being very intelligent, go through a check-list before takeoff. He knows. He could just state that everything is ready simply by visually inspecting everything. No pilot does that. He does not relax thinking that he has already done these checks earlier. When the aircraft is about to take off, he goes through a list of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5… 30… 40… 50. He meticulously checks and ticks each one. He ensures everything is proper. Only then, he takes off. If he presumes he can handle anything and takes off - and then a problem arises? God knows what happens to him. The passengers who trusted him end up losing lives. Thus, everyone must follow whatever rules are prescribed. We must wish for lokasangraha (well-being of the world), and practice karma (ordained duties). There is only one difference. We alluded to this earlier. One who is ignorant of all this desires for results. One who is knowledgeable does not desire for results. This is the only difference. In terms of practicing karma (actions/duties), everyone is equal.\nSri Krishna did not stop there. He is taking Arjuna forward in the 26th verse.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna buddhibhe:dam janaye:th\najna:na:m karma sangina:m |\njo:shaye:th sarvakarma:ni\nvidva:n yukthaha sama:charan ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nA wise person should not create confusion in the minds of the ignorant who are attached to actions. He should encourage them to perform all actions, by himself acting with devotion.\n-----------------------------------------------\nna buddhi bhe:dam janaye:th (do not create confusion in the mind)\n“These are for the wise. These are for the ignorant.” What happens if this is done? “Are you wise? Am I not? You are a human and so am I. I have the same blood running like you.” “You eat with a mouth and I eat too in the same way. What’s great about you?” “Why do you get that and I get this? What’s lacking in me?” He [the wise] should not be in any special position allowing a common man to get disturbed and deviated by that. If he thinks he can relinquish karma (actions/duties) because he has jnana (knowledge), the other one who does not have jnana (knowledge) also might do the same. “Physical expression is not so important. It’s important to have it in mind.” “I have complete belief in mind. I don’t need to express / act on a physical level.” He stops working. You are causing buddhi bhedam (confusion/division in his mind). You are making him feel that the things necessary to be done are unnecessary.\nna buddhi bhe:da janaye:th (do not create confusion in the mind)\nhe is not fully knowledgeable\najna:na:m karma sangina: (ignorant, attached to actions)\nHe has a need to do karma (actions/duties). He needs the results of karma (actions/duties). He is in the initial stage. It’s our responsibility to make sure he is not confused. He completed work to a certain extent. In that process, like a kid who is learning to walk, falls at times… If the mother leaves the child because he falls no matter how much she helps, would we be walking now? If the mother stops feeding the child who spits out his food, would we be eating now? That’s why…\njo:shaye:th sarva karma:ni (encourage all actions)\nHowever much he does, encourage him for that and try to enable his progress. This is what is expected from a wise person. Saying so, Sri Krishna is teaching Arjuna about his responsibility and takes him forward.. Let us also move along.\nVande guruparamparam (I bow to the lineage of gurus)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nThese days, we hear an ideology. People say… “All that matters is that one is devoted. It doesn’t matter what devotion. It should be within.” “He is worshiping - It doesn't matter what. Isn’t it better than not having any kind of practice?” We hear this from many people. It sounds very good and seems logical. Isn’t it? [People say…] “Isn’t doing something better than not doing anything?” There is a saying in English. “Something is better than nothing.” But, nothing is better than nonsense. Can we say it is better that someone is doing something? However, if that something he does is corrupting, then what? Doesn’t that ruin the entire thing? It is better to do nothing than create nonsense. In the name of doing something, you may create disturbance or problem for the whole. Isn’t this [not doing anything] better?\nThe reason we are discussing this topic is that… These days, we see many ‘methodologies’ in the name of bhakthi (devotion), devotion to God and dhya:na (meditation). When it comes to whom and how to worship… Scriptures have properly clarified what the right thing is to do and what is not necessary. They clearly described what a growth-seeker should do? They clearly described what a mumukshu (a seeker of freedom from karma) should do? It is only one thing. What is it?\nAny mantra establishes the same. There is an example used to explain this. Every river flows, and flows ultimately reaching the ocean. Similarly, it doesn't matter who we worship, reaches… ke:savam prathi gacchathi sarvade:va namaska:raha ke:savam prathi gacchathi (Whomever we worship, the prayers reach Ke:sava, right?) In that case, “Why can’t you happily worship Ke:sava?” “Why go somewhere else and then come here?” “Is anyone stopping you from worshiping Ke:sava directly? Is there any problem with that?” “No.” In that case, why don’t you happily do it? Just because you know a language, you construct some verses. “Everything is the same.” “Everything is good.” “Whatever you do, everything reaches the same destination.” People made up many such statements in the world today. We see that many people are in such a direction these days.\nIn earlier days, people constructed a temple specifically for a de:vatha (a divine power in the administration of God). Services are offered to the de:vatha accordingly. All worshippable entities have a respective procedure of worship - including Vishnu, Siva, Sakthi, Ganapathi, and other local de:vathas (divine powers). That’s the way it’s been forever. There are set procedures for worship. There are methods set for practicing those procedures. Despite all these in existence, people these days began certain trends. New methods emerged approx 60 or 70 years ago. What are they? All the de:vathas (divine powers) are ‘assembled’ and made accessible at one place. A shopping mall has everything in one place. Similarly, God ‘malls’ are where you find whoever you are looking for.\nNeither you nor I know what God looks like. Neither you nor I have seen what God looks like. We learnt about God from scriptures. We add something extra to what we heard from them and talk. If we really have faith, we must believe only what the scriptures have stated and practice it. Scriptures also have been given the authenticity level based on their stage. A:gamas (scriptures) are scriptures that describe God. That a:gama (scripture) is authentic when it does not conflict with Pura:nas (ancient texts). Pura:nas (ancient texts) discuss many topics. That pura:na (ancient text) is authentic when it does not conflict with Ithiha:sas (epics). Ithiha:sas (epics) are authentic when they teach a practice that doesn’t conflict with dharma sa:sthra (scriptures on righteous conduct). When do dharma sa:sthra (scriptures on righteous conduct) become authentic? Dharma sa:sthra (scriptures on righteous conduct) is authentic only when they don’t conflict with what their source, Ve:das (Vedas), say. Top-most priority is given to Ve:das (Vedas). When one practices in alignment with Ve:das (Vedas) and down to the scriptures, then it’s authentic. Anything conflicting keeps it out of the authentic set. This is what our rushis (sages) established.\nWhat do the Ve:das (Vedas) say? Amongst the Ve:das (Vedas), Yajurve:da (Yajurveda) is important. thasya yajure:va siraha (Yajurveda is the head) Don’t we say the head is the main part of the body? Only if it’s there, does the rest of the body work. Similarly, Yajurve:da (Yajurveda) is the head of all Ve:das (Vedas). Why? If the part of the system that rectifies any deficiency is in proper condition, then we can say that the system is fine. Isn’t it? If there is any deficiency in knowledge, then the process of filling the gap is yajna (sacrificial ritual). The part that declares the process of Yajna (sacrificial ritual) is Yajurve:da (Yajurveda). It clearly elaborates on Yajnas (sacrificial rituals). It allows for ways to regain anything that’s lost. Hence, it is the main one.\nIt is said that in Yajurve:da (Yajurveda), Purushasu:ktham (Purushasuktam) is the sira-stha:na (the head of the whole). Purushasu:ktham (Purushasuktam) is the primary part. What does it say? He is the sahasra-si:rsha-purusha (the ‘1000-headed being’). He is the one executing srusti-sthithi-laya (creation-sustenance-dissolution). That is how it starts. It is because of the one who does srusti-sthithi-laya (creation-sustenance-dissolution) that all of existence has taken form. Moving and non-moving - every entity that exists. That’s good. Now, how do we know who that is, what that thaththva (ultimate reality) is? How do we recognise it? When it details further, it’s said that whoever has Lakshmi sambandha (the divine bond with Lakshmi), He is the sahasra-si:rsha-purusha (the ‘1000-headed being’). hri:schathe: lakshmi:scha pathnyow (Hri and Lakshmi are your wives) If we realize that Purushasu:ktham (Purushasuktam) is paramount, and believe in it… If we believe in Ve:das (Vedas)…it says… The one with Lakshmi sambandha (divine bond with Lakshmi) is who executes universal srusti-sthithi-laya (creation-sustenance-dissolution). It is thus properly spelled in there. Various other parts of Ve:das (Vedas) clarify in many ways, in many instances, that He is Na:ra:yana (Narayana). The one with Lakshmi sambandha (divine bond with Lakshmi) is Na:ra:yana (Narayana). Hence, that thattthva (ultimate reality) is Lakshmi Na:ra:yana Thaththva (the ultimate reality of Lakshmi Narayana). Any other name also relates to Him through its meaning. Ve:dam (Veda) explains all of this.\nYet, because one has a few ‘followers’, can he establish himself as God and make a deity of himself next to Lord? What does that mean? If purushasu:ktham (Purushasuktam) is chanted ‘addressing’ him, his deity also receives abhishe:ka (ritual bathing) with milk and all full honors… There are many who sit there and have a deity of themselves receive abhishe:ka (ritual bathing). Should we praise them or question them? We must know this. We should never encourage anything that deviates us from the correct path, ultimately making us ignorant. We should encourage those who are facing difficulties practicing the right path. We should properly make note of the two. Encouragement does not mean you encourage anything one practices.\nAssume someone is thirsty. What does he need to do? Drink water. Coconuts have water. Rivers, wells and taps supply potable water. Drainages also carry water. Would anyone recommend them though? Can we say that it’s okay as long as he is drinking something? To quench thirst, someone drinks alcoholic drinks. Do we say “what’s important is he is drinking, not what he is drinking?” Do we encourage him by saying that he is drinking very well and that should go for 1, 2, 3, 4 more?! Think about it. Or if he is drinking from a drain somewhere to quench his thirst… Do we encourage him by saying “at least he is drinking something?” Encouraging means to give him healthy potable water as not to risk contamination. COVID times require us to be even more careful with all these rules. We should avoid touch and be extra vigilant. If he can’t drink without touching the glass to his mouth, that’s good. Because he is drinking potable water, you can tell him it’s okay. However, we cannot condone someone who is drinking drain water. You must stop him. It’s not important to drink just anything. It’s important to drink something healthy. Even when drinking healthy, there is a recommended process. He may not drink the entire glass at once, perhaps sip by sip. That can be encouraged.\nWhen having a meal, you must sit with folded legs - with a leaf, and glass of water next to you. You must do parise:chanam (purify and fortify the meal with sprinkled water), and only then eat. A child may not know yet. He doesn’t know how to eat without dropping the food. He may end up rubbing it on and around his mouth and stomach. Because he is trying to eat, encourage him. Teach him in gradual steps. If he is eating from the drain or dust, do we encourage him by saying at least he is eating something? No. Likewise, a beginner being taught to write, he will simply scribble the alphabet. It’s okay. Elders teach writing curves so they can be fit into the alphabets. For some time, they are taught curves on one side. Afterwards, they are taught curves that turn the other side. That is how we are taught. They did not let one keep on scribbling on the slate saying that he is at least writing something. In that case, he would not have learnt writing the alphabet throughout his entire life. If one lacks perfection or completeness in the prescribed process, no need to be critical or angry. Give encouragement for what’s been achieved so far. When one is doing weightlifting, if he succeeds in lifting them only half-way through, encourage him. However, if he is jumping up and down on the weights, do you claim he is jumping well? If one does even a fraction of what’s to be done, encourage him. That will enable him to reach perfection and completeness. The same goes for a:ra:dhana (worship), and jna:na (knowledge).\nThe authentic process must be stressed, as they are not topics that are easy to understand. We need not stress authenticity with things that can be readily seen. Our surroundings support our understanding of all that is visible. However, one must follow authentic standards in things that can’t be easily understood such as… a:thma (soul), manasu (mind), daivam (God), bhakthi (devotion) One may not do them as perfectly as the authentic standard prescribes. Jo:saye:th (encouragement), encouragement to beginners for any process must be done by one who has attained perfection in their practice... One must be encouraged to step up gradually.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\njo:shaye:th sarvakarma:ni\nvidva:n yukthaha sama:charan ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nA wise one, despite no necessity, must practice his duties perfectly and attentively like any beginner should. That way, he must encourage others towards that stage.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt’s the same with you. It is for that same reason I am practicing karma (action) despite not having any necessity. Arjuna! You must also attain perfection in that. You should not relinquish karma (action). You must only continue to practice them. Enlightening Arjuna this way, Sri Krishna takes him forward in chapter 3, verse 26.\nVande: guruparampara:m (I bow to the lineage of gurus) Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBhagavad Gita is God’s upadesa (teaching), a teaching prescribed to show us the right path. It is God’s upadesa (teaching) that guides us towards a disciplined lifestyle from an unrestrained one. Unregulated lifestyle is one way. Leading life in an orderly manner is another way. Unregulated lifestyle is called visrunkhalatha (unregulated lifestyle). It means behaving as per one’s own wishes. One who behaves as per his own wishes will decline. One who lives in an orderly manner may not have perfection to begin with. However, with gradual practice… It is said, abhyasam kusu vidya (everything becomes simple to achieve with practice), everything becomes simple to achieve with practice. With gradual regular practice guided by qualified mentors, he will attain the related success.\nBefore we proceed, let us offer our prayers:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna clarifies this in chapter 3, verse 26.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna buddhibhe:dam janaye:th\najna:na:m karma sangina:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne should not disturb the minds of ignorant people who are attached to their actions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKarma sangi (one who is attached to actions) is one who is not habituated to doing karma (action/duty) in the right manner. One who has the need for it. Not just doing karma (action/duty), but one who has the desire for results. One who needs them. He wants results and is doing the activity with the desire. He has to do karma (action/duty) and he has the desire for results. However, he lacks perfection. Vidvan (wise one) is one who has perfection in karma (action/duty), has no desire for results, and knows the right way. What is the responsibility of the wise one, i.e., vidvan (wise one)? He needs to encourage others who do not know it, even if they know a little bit. Joshayeth (encourage) means to encourage and help them move forward.\n“What are you doing? Doesn’t matter how many times you are told.”\n“You will never get it, even in the entire lifetime!”\nYou must not discourage them by speaking this way. It is important not to make them feel disappointed. You should not disappoint the people. Encourage them. You must not let them take the wrong route. Enable them to take the proper path.\nGenerally, especially in the topic of spirituality, there are so many paths that have emerged. How many new schools of thought! Many ways of reflection. If we question what is the basis for these ways of reflection, they would say that their experience is the only basis, nothing else… “My own experience!” How old are you and what level is your experience at? What is our lifespan? There are great beings with hundreds and thousands of years of lifespan. They didn’t bother about any of their physical desires. They desired only for the benefit of the rest of the beings. With only that goal in mind, they performed thapas (meditation/austerity). They discovered great eternal truths. They didn’t do this depending on their intellect. Ithi susruma purvesham ena sthad vyasa chakshure (They walked the path of their Elders. They gained experience in that path.) That is how they delivered the words of the essence. Putting aside and ignoring those… Not even practicing any proper lifestyle… Eating whatever and wherever and living however…. How can we recognize such people who state they have discovered better truths?\nThere are some officers in the military. They go through very strict and tough training. They go through various levels of training to stand, walk, hold or use a weapon the way they do. There is someone who did not go through the training, or doesn't know how to do anything. If they desire to become supreme commander, we pity such a person. There is no point in objecting to them. These days, there are many who ‘show’ the paths to eternal realities, ‘leading’ philosophies. There are many who are ‘taking forward’ many schools of thought into society. The interesting thing is that society is very tricky. There will be a few followers and believers for anyone who has to say something. It doesn’t matter what he does or how he behaves. There are people who propagate such things too.\nWe have come across some people recently. They said, “We worship only Ravana. He is our presiding deity of worship. Indrajith too.” “Hiranyakasipu is our presiding deity of worship. So, we pray to him.” We are seeing a few people this way. Not a few, actually many. There are followers for this approach too! Like how there are followers for those who teach good, there are followers for the wrongdoers too. However, what is the consequence of this? Society will be destroyed. The consequence is destruction.\n“What is the problem with compromising on one thing?”\n“Why should I sit only this way?”\n“Why does it matter what way one sits? Why does it matter what way one eats?”\n“Why does it matter how one roams around?”\n“Whatever there must be, it should be within. The focus and dedication.”\nHow can one know you are qualified within if that doesn’t reflect in the way you are on the outside? If one doesn’t qualify for grade 1, how can we accept their readiness for grade 10? There is a saying that one who cannot jump up at home is trying to reach the heights of heaven. If one does not know the basics of ABCD and says he is a doctorate, what do we say of him? It’s called the lack of wisdom. Just because he is a “good” talker, if he tries to show a path to society… Scriptures say that he will be destroyed in hundreds of ways! Viveka bhrastananthu (those who lack wisdom), they will be destroyed in many ways. Vinipathaha sathamukhaha (they will be destroyed in many ways). A fruit is attached to the tree through its stalk. If you say what happens if the stalk is cut off… If the stalk cuts off, the first step of destruction takes place. It’s called adya pathanam (first step in destruction), first step in destruction. Adya pathanam (first step in destruction) does not stop there. The fruit does not go back and connect to the branch. If the peel is disconnected from the tree, the fruit is on the ground. Hence, destruction does not stop at one point.\nObserve what people say these days. Many of them say, “Bhakti (devotion) is not about showing it through what you wear, it should be in the heart.” “Does it grow because of what you wear?” There are some rules that our sages put together. How should you put thilak (forehead mark)? How do you dress your hair? What should your dressing be like? How do you speak with others? What should be your attitude? What type of food can you ingest? How should you behave with others? “All these were necessary back then, are they necessary now?” Why do you ask if they are necessary? Are they blocking your work? Is your thilak (forehead mark) obstructing your work? Is the hairstyle obstructing you? Is the dressing style obstructing you? Is the food obstructing you? If it’s blocking your work, then you can think about it. If not, then what’s the problem with them?\nPeople stopped putting thilak (forehead mark). They stopped putting on sikha (traditional hair-knot). They started to get a haircut. It didn’t stop there. They went forward with a mustache. Earlier, a mustache was something that was curled up. Now, fashion is to dress it down. It’s a trending style. Later, not knowing upwards or downwards, it started to take a different shape and spread forth. There is now no limit to the number of styles. Same with dressing. “Why should one be dressed up this way? Why not shirts?!” Started with wearing shirts. Later, it's about pancha (traditional clothes). “Why not wear pants?” Now, it’s the norm. “Why only sit and eat? What happens if we stand and eat?” Now, that’s in place. This is destruction on the go in every way. Yet, he wants to be accepted as someone who is practicing dharmic (righteous), righteous and sastric (scriptural), scriptural methods. What do we say of him?\nWhen we see a rule that is being practiced in a dharmic (righteous) place today… We cannot guess how many hundreds of years of hard work and research is behind it. It’s not in one domain. It’s about how one talks, dresses, or about applying thilak (forehead mark) or food that’s eaten. It is recommended to start with dal and finish with buttermilk. There was so much research done about it. “Why does it matter what to eat, from where, how to eat…?” What do we tell such a person who does not know anything about it? If he brings up science and all, what do we tell him? How much of science has he seen? What is he seeing science as? Each of these surprises us. We see presumptuousness in one who is objecting to these. We also see arrogance that’s way beyond in him. We see a sense of faith and obedience in one who is practicing them. We see them being humble. We also see a helping nature in them. These recommended practices have a benefit. We don’t know what it is. So, we object to them and not practice them saying that they are not useful to us. We expect that whatever practice yields a temporary benefit is also given the same high regard. Such efforts become the cause of destruction of society. They pave the path for the end of a society.\nWhere have we reached today? Earlier, we would take a bath, do anushtana (daily rituals), do manasa yaga (mental sacrifice), and then japa (chanting). “What happens if we perform japa (chanting) whenever and wherever we can?” That is also explained by our rushis (great beings/sages), the great beings. When is that accepted? When you attained a certain state. Then, it’s okay if you sit in whatever way and however. You can also sit in sukhasana (comfortable position), a comfortable position. When you attain a certain state, it will be fine no matter how you sit. However, how about until then? You must practice whatever is the process and follow the rules. Otherwise, one who is preaching and the followers will all be at loss.\nTherefore, in verse 3.26, Sri Krishna says… He is not asking you to encourage an unregulated lifestyle. He is not condemning the act of telling people who follow an unregulated lifestyle as being wrong.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna buddhi bhe:dam janaye:th ajna:na:m karma sangina:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne should not disturb the minds of ignorant people who are attached to their actions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDon’t tell those in their initial stages of practicing right things that they are useless or that they will never succeed. You cannot discard them like that.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\njo:shaye:th sarva karma:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne should encourage all actions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nEncourage… If there are any mistakes in their initial stages of practice… Don’t point out the mistakes and make him repulsive. Encourage whatever little he does, he will want to do more and better. If he does one, pat him. He wants to do two. Praise him. He wants to do three. You should encourage good practices this way. You should not discourage him. Doing so, you are letting him know that it is right to practice good activities. Arjuna did this with Uttharakumara. He encouraged him at the time of utthara gograhana enabling him to take part in war. However, Arjuna today was engrossed in the same arrogance. That is why, it became a necessity to instruct him about duties. In chapter 3, Sri Krishna is taking him towards practicing right activities. Let us try to learn about it more clearly.\nVande guruparamparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n`a:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m lo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham` (I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, grants all prosperity, and delights the world.)\nBhagavad Gita chapter 3 provided `upade:sas` (teachings) to humans about the proper way of doing work. Work gets done with the support of two things. One is `sari:ra` (the body). Second is `jna:na` (knowledge). If knowledge does not support, then the body cannot do anything. In a case where knowledge is no longer supporting it, the body is called dead. If you want knowledge alone to complete the work, it doesn’t work that way. It needs a tool to work. That is body. Body is the tool. Knowledge is the underlying essential.\nKnowledge is like the electricity that runs a fan. A fan runs and gives air. However, fan blades don’t rotate by themselves. It runs only when there is electricity passing through. Electricity by itself doesn’t give air either. It gives air only when there is a necessary apparatus set up. If we observe this carefully, we can apply this in the case of the body. The body is a tool that works. Knowledge is like the electric current that is supplied from `a:thma` (the soul). Hence, there are two things: one that works and the other which makes it work. How should these both work? This is what Sri Krishna is explaining in chapter 3.\nThe body must work but the knowledge provided should be free of ego. It should not feel that it is the doer. This feeling is called `bha:vana` (internal feeling). `Bha:vana` (internal feeling) is one thing. `Ba:hyam` (external act) is the other thing. `Bha:vana` (internal feeling) is internal. `Ba:hyam` (external act) is the body that’s working. There are differences in the way work is done. The reason for these differences is the passages that the work is done through. Let’s look at the electric current example. To pass, it needs wires to go through. The wires have certain powers; 720 / 360 etc. They have various capacities. Accordingly, there is a difference in the amount of current that can flow through them. Also, the electric current makes the tool work differently based on the type of tool it is. Should it make the fan rotate to circulate air? Should it make it give out heat? Should it give a cooling effect? Should it display images? Or should it give out only sounds? Each device has some purpose that it’s made for. There is a passage that carries the current needed to flow through for getting that work done.\nSimilarly, the soul which releases the current of knowledge also has ‘wires’ such as `manasu` (mind), sense organs etc. The tool that does the work is the body. Each body is assigned a specific purpose. Analogous to how there is a separate device for purposes like displaying images, producing sounds, circulating air, releasing heat or for cool air. Each one has a different work. Similarly, each body has a different work. That body must do that work. You cannot say I will do some other work. If the device that is made to be only producing heat is expected to work as an air cooler, it can’t. If it tries to do it, it will take the lives of people around there. If the device that is made for only cooling air is expected to produce heat, it can’t. That is not its work. Whatever work is ordained for a body, that is what it must do. That is how our mechanism works too.\nThere are several types of bodies. Bodies of humans, animals, birds, trees etc. In the bodies of humans, there are types such as different colors, heights, weights etc. These are all like the external devices. These devices are made of `pancha bhu:thas` (five elements of Nature). All the devices are made of `pancha bhu:thas` (five elements). It doesn’t matter if it is AC, heater or anything else, it is made of the same elements. However, there is a different purpose to each. Similarly, the underlying cause for their formation is different `karma` (actions/deeds). This `karma` (actions/deeds) doesn’t change. We know what `pancha bhu:thas` (five elements) are: Earth, fire, water, air, and space. Each and every body is made of them. To make those bodies work, there is a mechanism like a transmitter that enables them to work. What is it? `satthvamu, rajassu and thamassu` (goodness, passion, and ignorance).\n`Satthva` (goodness) is that which provides knowledge of things as they are and makes it work. `Rajas` (passion) is that which gives rise to arrogance not giving knowledge of things as they are. `Thamas` (ignorance) is that which tries to cover the knowledge making one understand things differently than they are. All these three are the qualities of Nature. `Satthva` (goodness), `rajas` (passion), and `thamas` (ignorance) are the qualities of Nature. Bodies are made of `pancha bhu:thas` (five elements). `Pancha bhu:thas` (five elements) are nothing but Nature. `Sattva` (goodness), `rajas` (passion) and `thamas` (ignorance) are their qualities. Dwelling within, they see that the work is done through the body transmitting knowledge from the soul.\nWhat should one do now? He should be unaffected by them. So, he must get rid of the feeling that he is the doer. Because he also does not own the mechanism of knowledge flow. Electric current does not pass through the circuits of the fan, AC etc by itself. There is someone who is running it from behind the scenes. Like the way he owns which channel it must flow through, there is someone behind the scenes running all the souls. He is named `Bhagava:n` (Lord) or `De:va` (God) or `Parama:thma` (Supreme Soul) or something else. What it is and who it is a separate topic to be put aside for now. There is something underlying though. For as long as He puts him there, he will exist. He (the soul) will transmit knowledge (in the body) the way He (God) directs. He (the soul) keeps using the tool (the body) for that period of time. If he can leave the burden to Him, then He becomes useful to him, cutting down the existing burden and not adding to it. The Divine Supreme helps that way. He (the soul) will be released from `karma bandha` (the bondage of actions). `Karma` (actions/deeds) is that which caused the differences in the devices (bodies). This `karma bandha` (bondage of actions) must go. Then, the soul will be released from here. There is the bondage of `karma bandha` (bondage of actions) that’s blocking him from being released. Therefore, he must be helped to recognise it and understand it. He must be enabled to take care so that there are no adverse effects such as not seeing things as they are, or seeing them as something else due to `rajas` (passion) and `thamas` (ignorance). He must know to try to keep a check on them and enhance `satthva` (goodness). Then, it becomes relatively easy to unbind `karma bandha` (the bondage of actions). This is what he must be enlightened with. If he can achieve this, it is then that the human body becomes a properly utilisable tool. Otherwise, it will become a tool for pulling him further down and down.\nWhatever is giving rise to `satthva` (goodness), `rajas` (passion) and `thamas` (ignorance) made of `pancha bhu:thas` (five elements) is all together called `prakruthi` (Nature). He must know that this is the cause for different things in him. He has knowledge, isn’t it? The knowledge must help him understand that what is working is the `prakruthi` (Nature), not he. It should tell him that he is in the `prakruthi` (Nature) but he is not `prakruthi` (Nature). “`Prakruthi` (Nature) is a tool that’s given.” “I am also not independent.” “There is someone underlying who is running it.” “Let me leave the burden to Him.” “Then it will not bind me.” This is the knowledge he must perform work with.\nHe (Krishna) beautifully describes this in verse 27 of chapter 3.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprakruthe:h kriyama:na:ni gunaih karma:ni sarvasaha |\nahanka:ra-vimu:da:thma: kartha:ham iti manyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll actions are performed by the qualities of Nature (prakruthi). The soul, bewildered by ego (ahankara), thinks, \"I am the doer.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nLet's break down the first line:\n`sarvasaha` (everywhere)\n`karma:ni` (devices, i.e., the bodies which are the tools)\n`kriyama:na:ni` (are working on activities)\nHow are they working?\n`prakruthe:h gunaih` (by the qualities of Nature)\nWe say that bodies are made of `pancha bhu:thas` (five elements). They have `sattva` (goodness), `rajas` (passion) and `thamas` (ignorance) qualities. These qualities are natural for them. Saltiness for salt, sweetness for sugar, bitterness for neem, spiciness for a chilly, sourness for tamarind are natural. Similarly, Nature has `sattva` (goodness), `rajas` (passion) and `thamas` (ignorance) by nature. They are not brought into it from somewhere. A soul however does not have these. The soul only has knowledge. Like electricity is not cool or hot. It does not have images or rotation or sound. Electricity is different from these. However, when the fan is rotating, we say it’s the electric current that’s giving the pleasant air. Is current giving the air? We also say fan is giving the pleasant air. Is fan giving the air? It is their combination that’s giving it. Current has the power to rotate something. Because it's rotating, there is flow of air. There is a mechanism in the blades of the fan for rotation and so they do so. There is a purpose for them being made that way. Similarly, there is a purpose for this body. It is named `karma` (action/duty). Practicing `karma` (action/duty) is what one must be doing. However, when he is practicing `karma` (action/duty), he should not feel that he is the doer. “It is the body that’s doing. It’s not me.” If he has this `bha:vana` (feeling), then the result of the work done will not latch on to him as a burden.\n`prakruthe:h gunaih kriyama:na:ni karma:ni` (All this work is done because of the `sattva` (goodness), `rajas` (passion) and `thamas` (ignorance) qualities of Nature, not because of me.) However, do we think this way? We become arrogant thinking that we are doing what limbs of the body are actually doing. Whatever the results of the work done are for the body but we think they are for us. To be clear, the soul is not gaining anything. It’s the body that gets the results. If someone puts his hand on ice, it gets cold. That is for the body. He puts hand on fire. It gets burnt. That is for the body. However, he assumed a relation with the body. In fact, he is different but he assumed that it (the body) is him. Hence, he feels he is being burnt (when the hand gets burnt). He feels he is getting cold. He feels he is the one doing the work. He feels he is the one experiencing it. He feels he wants this. He feels he is the reason for something getting done. He assumes all of this upon him. Is there a relation between the electric current and what happens with the devices? Because it’s not assuming it, current is ‘safe’. If the soul also does not assume that, the soul is also safe. However, we are not like that. What is our knowledge doing? It is making us tied to the bonds of the body.\nIdentifying oneself with the body, which he is not, is termed as `ahanka:ram` (ego/false ego). `Aham` (I) is `a:thma` (the soul). `Sari:ram` (the body) is different. That knowledge which made him feel what is not `aham` (I) as `aham` (I) is called `ahamka:ram` (ego/false ego). `anaham aham kri:yathe:` (what is not \"I\" is made into \"I\"). What happens when there is `ahanka:ram` (ego/false ego)? It becomes a layer (blocker). `vimu:da a:thma:` (His soul becomes deluded). His `manas` (mind) becomes like a layer of soot covering the light. `ahanka:ra vimu:da:thma:` (the soul bewildered by ego). The doer is actually the underlying One (God). Or it is the body. It’s not him. He is just a mediator. However, `kartha:ha mithimanyathe:` (\"I am doing all this. I am the cause for all of this to happen. All of this is for me.\" he thinks). That’s it. His destruction begins.\nWhat should he be doing instead? He can do it two ways. He can either put the responsibility on the body because it is the tool. Or he can put it on his underlying support who is God. You can put it on `prakruthi` (Nature) or `parama:thma` (the Supreme Soul). Don’t put it on yourself. However, we don’t put it on either of them. “If I am the one doing it, why would we put it on Him?” “I am the one who is working hard, why would I put it on the body?” “I will keep it with me.” Doing so, he is becoming prey for `ahanka:ra` (ego/false ego). His `manas` (mind) gets closed. He is becoming `vimu:da:thma` (a deluded soul). He is thus getting further tied into `bandha` (bondage). This is not right. This is what Sri Krishna is teaching Arjuna in verse 3.27. He is taking him forward; let’s also learn.\nVande: guruparampara:m\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBhagavad Gita is a small scripture that properly clarifies what is human life, the feelings, goal, and recommended lifestyle. Vedas (sacred texts) preach knowledge to human beings. However, it is difficult to learn the entire Vedas, understand, and then practice it. So, when God descended as Sri Krishna, He thought of delivering the essence of Vedas. As a result of His efforts for it, He found Arjuna in the warfield. He began to give the wonderful upadesa (teaching) called Bhagavad Gita to humankind using him as the reason. It has 700 verses. It enlightens humankind with many rahasyas (secrets), valuable knowledge not revealed unless sought.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow down to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, grants all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSome of these rahasyas (secrets) are related to daily life. Some are related to the process that a soul takes while traveling after the current life. Some are related to the goals that must be reached. There are so many such aspects that God embedded in it. Amongst them, He clarifies that \"Human beings are not allowed to abandon daily life duties.\" From beginning to the end in Bhagavad Gita, it clarifies that a person must not give up his duties. It in fact starts off with it. Arjuna’s duty is to ensure the well-being of people and punish the wrong-doers. When wrong-doers are your relatives, what should one do? Yet, there is no excuse. He wanted to properly clarify it to humankind.\nGenerally, you have a soft corner for someone you think of as yours. We try to somehow get them to escape from it. If we think that someone is not ours, we somehow fix him with a crime and punish him. There should not be discrimination based on sva (mine), para (not mine), and one must be punished if guilty. If they are good, then they should be awarded with appropriate upliftment. Whatever it is, no one is allowed to turn his back on duties. He wants to clarify this to Arjuna. Teaching this to him, He talked about what human beings in general must do and how.\nIn this step, there is the first shatkam (set of six chapters), i.e., Chapter 1 through Chapter 6. What are the topics that we all must learn in general, excluding the topic of God? What must a human being know about himself? What should he know when he is behaving with other surrounding people? How should he feel/think about whatever he does? He felt that it’s important to teach these and began to do so. In Chapter 3, He is more clearly explaining it. Human beings are given great knowledge by God. That is where the difference is between human beings and animals. Animals behave and so do human beings. Human beings are one kind of animal. Other animals are four-legged and some have more than that. A human being is a two-legged animal. He is also an animal. His greatness lies in that he is qualified to think well. He needs to learn how to think about his work so it doesn’t take him away from his goal. This is what He is teaching: “Think and work.”\nWhat should he think about and how should he do it? We all know something. Let’s say there is someone who works at printing money. The office is called a mint. This is where coins are produced or notes are printed. Such a place is called a mint. They print coins in thousands, i.e., in bulk. There are 1 rupee, 5 rupees, quarters or 50 paisa, etc. Earlier, there were those denominations. Nowadays, such denominations probably don’t exist. Today, it could be 5, 10, 20, 50 rupees, etc. They produce these coins. These are produced in thousands. There are people who work there. In some facilities, they print rupee notes in denominations like 50, 100, or 2000. These are also printed in bulk, like in lakhs. People working there use their own hands in the process of collection, packing into bundles, and dispersing them. They are all employees. They work for money. They also have needs.\nHowever, despite using his own hands to process, pack, disperse to all locations, can he think any of those notes are his? As he is printing the coins, can he put some in his pocket because they are looking good? He is using his own hands. He gets scanned when he is sent to the office. Also, he is sent out after a scan. He should go in as one and return as the same. He is not allowed to bring back with him a single coin or pack any rupee note in a book of his. However, he is working with them. When he is working with them, he must be working with a certain knowledge. What is that knowledge? “All these objects belong to the government. I am serving the government.” “My responsibility is to print, pack, and disperse.” “It’s prohibited to put them into my account.” “These are not related to me.” “I do not own these.” Shouldn’t he have this clarity? In general, this is how clear they should be. Let’s assume that’s the case. That’s how they should be working there. If things are missing, there will be detailed enquiries by higher officials. If anyone is found guilty, there will be serious punishments. For as long as one is working there, he is not allowed to take any aspects out from there. It does not matter if it's just for fun or serious, he cannot discuss any internal information with others. He cannot disclose things like, “we printed these many. We did it this way. We used this technology.” If it’s already open to the public through rulers, then it’s okay to discuss. Otherwise, they cannot. It is a policy. If the rulers talk about it, they can talk. Despite being employees there who are always working with and being around them, they are not allowed to talk about them. They should be 100% committed to the work though.\nHe can do what he wants with the money that’s paid to him as salary at the end of the month. He may be getting the coins or notes as part of the salary. He can use only those. He can use them as per his wish. He can spend it on personal purposes. He can use it for family, relatives, and friends. He has the freedom to do what he wants with only whatever is allocated to him. He does not have any ownership, desire, or connection with anything that’s beyond it. We all know this.\nSimilarly, when a human being is living his life in this world, he is also an ‘employee’. Who is he here? He is the conscious jiva (individual soul) dwelling in the body, giving the necessary power for it to move. That is what ‘I’ means. If one is saying ‘I’, that means the indwelling jiva (individual soul) is being referred to. Whatever form you are seeing externally is called sharira (body). When there is jiva (individual soul) in it, the body works. When the jiva (individual soul) leaves it, there is no value to the body. We dispose of the body in some way. We all know this. He entered the body as an ‘employee’. Whatever time is allocated, he will be in it for that long. He should work while in it. When working, he will be working with the ones related to the body. He will need to work with the ones supporting the body. He will need to work with friends, enemies, rulers, assistants. He will also need to absorb what he needs from Nature. He will need to experience what he needs to. He will need to encourage what he needs to. He cannot escape doing all of these. We know this.\nWhen working, what is the underlying thought process? What kind of [thought process] will enable him to be comfortably relieved from the current employment? Those who are working in the mint will retire with proper benefits only if they do not have any ‘black mark’. Or else, they will all be appropriately withheld. We know this. Similarly, when a jiva (individual soul) takes this employment, irrespective of male or female, unless the person works properly, he will not get the greater benefits post completion. Otherwise, he will end up falling from his current state. Nobody wishes for it. Everyone wishes for upliftment. If you want that upliftment, this is what you must learn about the way to do things. The essence of Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3 is to explain this topic clearly. In Chapter 2, Sri Krishna explained deha (body) and jiva (individual soul) to be different from each other. In Chapter 3, He is teaching and clarifying to Arjuna what process a jiva (individual soul) should follow. In the process, He is re-instructing humankind. That is what we are learning now. Let’s gradually move forward.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m lo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham (I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nBhagavad Gita is a sathgranttha (great scripture) that teaches higher knowledge in a simple way. There are no complicated theories. Bhagavad Gita is a scripture with comfortable and beautiful terms that are easy to understand. That is why, Bhagavad Gita is the single scripture that is wide-spread and has won everyone’s praise. Also, Bhagavad Gita is the scripture that has been translated into many languages of the world. Not limited to religion, caste etc, it bestows a clear process that uplifts any human beautifully. It is a great teaching that was available to us before the advent of any differences between religions etc. Bhagavad Gita is the great scripture that can address any differences that may come up. We are listening to the teachings bestowed in chapter 3 of it.\nWhy is a human being struggling, tied up in this prakruthi (Nature) and not getting liberated? What is the reason? This is the question. He gives the answer to this in verse 27, chapter 3.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprakruthe:h kriyama:na:ni gunaih karma:ni sarvasaha |\nahanka:ra vimu:dda:thma: kartha::ham ithi manyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll actions are performed by the qualities of Nature. The deluded soul, identifying with the ego, thinks 'I am the doer'.\n-----------------------------------------------\naham kartha: ithi manyathe: (I am the doer, he thinks). One thinks he is the one doing something. In fact, he is not the one doing it. There is an underlying power that runs him. Who is that? Three verses ahead, He states that it is He who is running things from behind. “We can’t see who that is.” No problem. You are at least seeing the body that is on you. Yes. Where is this body coming from? What is it made of?\nprakruthe:h gunaih kriyama:na:m idam sari:ram (this body is made by the qualities of Nature). Body is the micro form of Nature. Like a seed that contains everything that a huge tree has… The body is a small image of the largely widespread Nature. That is why, if we properly recognise and understand it, we would understand the entire Nature. We are doing work whilst in this body. We are doing various kinds of work. What is the basis for all that work? There are some tastes that are being developed in it. There are some behaviors that are being manifested in it. On what basis are these being formed? Some like sweets. They would look for sweets in Nature and have them. Some like sour. They would look for items tasting sour and get them. According to his nature, he will select things from Nature and take them. He will get them from Nature only because this [body] is made out of Nature. To adjust whatever is lacking or in excess, it takes from Nature because it is necessary for the body.\nWhat is it made of? prakruthe:h gunaih kriyama:na:m (made by the qualities of Nature). Whatever we are seeing as prakruthi (Nature) is a mixture of some bhu:thas (elements). We often hear the very popular word, pancha bhu:thas (five elements). The gross part of the body is made of matti (Earth). The softness in it is a result of Water. The heat or the nature of various colors is a result of Thejas (light/energy). The:jas (light/energy) is what we refer to as fire but fire is only a form of the:jas (light/energy). Let’s call it The:jas (light/energy) which is a substance. We see brightness in the Sun. We ‘see’ heat in fire. The underlying raw material for these is called the:jas (light/energy). Let’s say that it is agni (fire) because we can see it easily and we understand it. So, this is a substance. It causes various changes in colors, also changes in shape. A body is dark in color like coal. The reason is the:jas (light/energy). Another body looks like it’s been just now lifted from a snow mountain. The reason for this too is the:jas (light/energy). Another one is wheatish. The:jas (light/energy) is the reason for this too. The:jas (light/energy) is the cause for all the colors. There is a system that gives arise to awareness. That is named va:yu (Air). We hear a sound when something happens here. This is due to a:ka:sa (Space). There are five substances. This [body] is made of these five substances. Not just this, every form we see around in this Universe is made of the same. That is why, sages say that Nature is made of the five elements. We [our bodies] are also made the same way.\nMatti (Earth) has the quality of giving the knowledge of smell. Water has the quality of giving the knowledge of taste. The:jas (light/energy) has the quality of giving knowledge of a form or changing color. Va:yu (Air) has the quality of giving the knowledge of touch. A:ka:sa (Space) has the power of giving the knowledge of hearing. Whatever happens with these five are due to the movement of the respective bhu:tha (element). We must recognise they are happening because of the association with the respective bhu:tha (element). Body is Nature that is made of the five elements.\nFirstly, why is there movement of these five? We are calling ourselves ji:va (living being) because there is a movement. Only then do we say there is life or one is a living being. We say he is growing up or wearing down. Something is happening. What is the cause for these? Why are there movements in this? Why isn’t everyone being static? There are three swabhava:s (natures/tendencies) for the five together. They are named gunas (qualities). Sattva (goodness) is one guna (quality). Rajas (passion/activity) is another guna (quality). Thamas (ignorance/inertia) is the other guna (quality). We see/recognise pancha bhu:thas (five elements) in this. We can see earth, water, the:jas (light/energy). Air is invisible but can be felt on the skin. Air can be recognised to that extent. A:ka:sa (Space) is invisible. Skin can’t feel it. It proves its existence by making sounds audible to us. It’s naive if we say that we believe only that which is visible to our eyes. That is an immature position to take. Many people think that it’s considered existent only when visible to the eyes. That is wrong. It is something that an LKG student says. Because not everything is visible to the eyes. Is taste visible? Do we say it’s not existing? There is a different tool that recognises it. There is a different sense-organ [that recognises it]. Same thing with element a:ka:sa (Space). Many philosophers don’t agree to its existence. Why? They say because it’s not visible. They accept air because it’s at least felt by our skin. Or it lets us know of its existence through the movement of leaves of trees. Even then, like we recognise air despite not being visible to the eye because of some other reason. Similarly, we must recognise a:ka:sa (Space). Cha:rva:kas accept only four of the substances - pruthvi (Earth), ap (Water), the:ja (Fire/Light), va:yu (Air). There is no a:ka:sa (Space) for them. They don’t accept pancha bhu:thas (five elements). They say they are just four. Why don’t they accept? They ask about how to recognise. You recognise air despite not being visible to the eye because it’s felt or the movement it causes. Similarly, if you are hearing any sound, you must understand it comes through a:ka:sa (Space). Thus you must accept a bhu:tha (element) named a:ka:sa (Space). So, the common qualities of all these pancha bhu:thas (five elements) together are sattva (goodness), rajas (passion/activity) and thamas (ignorance/inertia).\nWe can experience the effect of these qualities in another way. If a person is sleeping deeply, lazing, not knowing what is going on, then it means thamas (ignorance/inertia) is affecting him. Thamas (ignorance/inertia) is the reason for that person’s nature. If a person is hyper active, aggressive, motivated (for action), then it means rajas (passion/activity) quality is working on him. If a person is behaving very well, listening to guidance, helpful to everyone, and with all good qualities we know… It means there is an underlying inspiration that causes such a state in the person. That inspiration is a quality of prakruthi (Nature) and is called satthva (goodness). This sattva (goodness) causes clear purity and goodness in a person. Rajas (passion/activity) causes aggressiveness in a person. Thamas (ignorance/inertia) causes weakness, laziness, tiredness. This is in the substances. When there is movement in the pancha bhu:thas (five elements), there is movement of these qualities. It is because of these qualities that there is a change in the attitude of a person. Therefore prakruthi (Nature) is made of five elements and has three qualities. We must remember this. It is a mixture of five elements. It has three qualities. It is not formed of three qualities. It has three qualities. If we recognise this, we can answer everything that’s happening in us. God explains this in verse 3.27. Let’s gradually move ahead learning about it.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nGod wonderfully described the way Nature has taken its shape. In chapter 3, He starts off with explaining what takes life ahead, where we are, how we should live. It can be considered as the basic principle for whatever governments and scientists speak today. That is how clearly He explained. What did He say? How is srusti (creation) taking place? How should you live with it? We are all living with what’s given by Nature. We are living with them and in them. He started off with…\nanna:th bhavanthi bhu:tha:ni (All the substances in Nature are the cause for our existence.)\nWe should become the cause for their survival. Give and take from each other and live together. He said so. Human beings should never think this is a solo action or make it a one way traffic. You are living depending on Nature. You are living with the elements of Nature. You should always cooperate with Nature. You should ensure it’s in the proper state and you should also be in the proper state. These days, people are saying “protect each drop of water, protect every grain of sand”. “Take care of each leaf carefully.” People are saying as if these are all new but they are not new. God clearly stated these in Bhagavad Gita. De:vatha (divine being) is defined as that which is invisible, spread everywhere, and provides us with the base of our survival. Air is invisible. We can’t live without it for a second. Try to close your nose, mouth and ears. Can we live like that? What that means is that it is cooperating with us every second. We never see that it is broadcasting proudly about it? Despite our contaminating it, it somehow tries to provide us with what supports our living. We all know we can’t live without water. We waste water. We contaminate water. We spoil water in many ways. Human beings in general. Perhaps some of us individually are not doing this. In general, water is being abused in many ways. Is water demanding anything from us saying that it is doing us all a huge favor? No. Despite how much contamination we cause, it adapts a process and is making itself available as clean water. It is giving us life. We do not know how and where it is working. It is supporting our life. It’s a supernatural power. It is a power that is ever helpful to us. So, it is called de:vatha (divine being). It is jala de:vatha (water deity), called Varuna. Air is called Va:yu (wind deity). All things in Nature are supporting our life. You are living because of them. You are carrying on with your life because of them. You are growing because of them. You are growing things around you because of them. So, don’t harm them. Support them. Do whatever you can for their survival. Take what you need from them. Give what they need. Live in unison supporting each other. This is what He started off with. He started off explaining this. He went on to say that He also practices the same. Not just you. He showed His greatness as He took birth. He took birth with four hands. We celebrate Krishna:stami (Krishna's birthday celebration), time of appearance of Krishna. We are ‘witnessing’ it [during celebration]. He was born in jail. He was born at midnight. He was born with four hands. He was born as sarva:bharana bhu:shitha (fully ornamented). This is very unexpected. Something that no one ever knew of. He was born that way. He was born whilst showing His greatness. I am God but descended to be with you all. I came to support you and to provide you with what you want. Through practice, teachings and inspiration. This is My purpose. He said that about Himself. You must also live for the world in the same way.\nlo:ka sangraham e:va:pi sampasyan karthum arhasi (You must also live for the world in the same way, seeing that I don’t have any need, yet I am living in the same way.)\nHe is giving Himself as an example. He started off with this. Learning about this way of life is mandatory for anyone. Once you step on the Earth, it doesn't matter who or how great you are… If you are living on a part of this land and using its resources, this way of life is mandatory to practice. If you say you are not using its resources because you are in a meditative state… You are still occupying some space and taking breath. That means you are using it [Nature]. Thus, it is impossible for any living being to not use it when they are born here. When using, they must live in the way that’s appropriate here.\nvartha e:va cha karmani (I am also living fulfilling My responsibilities.)\n“Why can’t you do it?” “What’s the problem for anyone to be this way?” No one is allowed to say that they descended from somewhere and that they need not practice all this. Even if you descended, you descended here [into this Nature]. Whoever says they descended, they descended to the Earth. What it means is that they descended occupying some space here. Meaning you are using it. Thus, you also must live in accordance with it. “I will not carry out my responsibilities.” Not allowed to do this. If you think you have attained the highest knowledge, even then it is mandatory. Because others should not be spoiled looking at you. This is what He said, giving Himself as an example.\nsaktha:ha (those interested)\nLike those interested in the work, you must also do it despite being vidva:n (knowledgeable). There is only one difference. You don’t desire the result whereas he desires for it. That’s all. There is no compromise of any kind while doing the work. Generally, there is a rule in service organizations. What is the rule? Some take a monthly salary and work as employees. Some serve as volunteers with enthusiasm not taking any salary. The difference between the salaried and volunteers is only at the screening at the entrance area. Once they cross the screening area and enter work… It does not matter if they are salaried or volunteers, they should not compromise in the work they do. They cannot pose saying that they are serving ‘for free’. Accountability and answerability will be there for volunteers too. This is clear for all those who are in the service organizations. There are some hospitals. Generally, people pay and join when they need treatment for some disease or sickness. Because they pay, they demand some process or things. They also allow some sections of people as part of service without taking any payment from them. The hospital staff don’t think they can do what they want with them because they are not paying. The hospital staff also don’t think that they must give the rich people any special treatment. Whether the patient is paying or not paying matters only until the entrance area. After crossing it, there is no question about whether he is rich or poor, or admitted with payment or not. Once in the hands of a proper doctor, he will be provided with necessary treatment of the same quality. This is what happens in proper hospitals. There are doctors who work as employed surgeons and some are visiting professionals serving for free. They all will do the same work. Only until they enter, it matters if he is a paid surgeon or one who is volunteering for service. Once they wear the uniform and enter their duty, he will do whatever is essential. Example it could take 10 hours, 18 hours or 24 hours to perform an operation. Any volunteering doctor cannot say that he is doing it for free and so he won’t work that long. The rules and regulations of a profession are applicable to everyone. Once you are born on the Earth, that is how you must perform your responsibilities. It does not matter if one is Wise or not, or a common being or an incarnation of God. Once he is in the world, no one can compromise in the responsibilities that are ordained upon him. It is mandatory for everyone.\nkarmani varthathe: e:va (one must do their work)\nIn chapter 3, God gives clear rules on the topic of responsibilities. We are learning that now and shall gradually move forward.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\n(I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nHuman life is very valuable. We do not know how long it lasts. In times such as COVID, we have no idea what will happen the next second. Primarily, recognize how one is during the lifetime rather than the length of the lifetime. This is the message from Bhagavad Gita for humans. It is about qualitative life, not quantitative life.\nWhat is the quality that a human being must recognize?\nWho am I?\nWhere am I?\nHow should I be?\nI am not the body. I am different from the body. Where am I? I am in this body. Why am I here? Someone brought me here for a responsibility. What is the responsibility here? There is a setup or enclosure for its [body’s] formation. It has come into existence as part of a network. It has come into a network. The network is made of mother, father, uncles, aunts, grandparents. It’s a big network. This body entered this network. You are in it. That is, the soul is dwelling within [the body]. Hence, you must work in accordance with it.\nOne has a certain level of knowledge necessary for livelihood. That’s essential. With that knowledge, you should know what work you can do to earn a livelihood. One may study Carpentry, another may study Masonry. One may study Law. One may choose Medicine. One may study Business. One may do Commerce, another may do Economics. One may choose Politics. Something else… Whatever it is, it is the education you acquired for livelihood. As long as life lasts, use it properly. It is knowledge that you have got to fulfill your responsibility with the world. The appropriate workplace is your priority. Remember that it is ordained for the purpose of nurturing the body that you are in. Do it to that extent.\nHow about for your nourishment? You are not permanent here [in this body]. There is an appointed chef in a hotel. He cooks and keeps dishes ready for those coming in. He also has to eat something, right? He cooks all the varieties of food for those coming in. Similarly, he should also be eating something for himself too. While being required to satisfy all the people coming in by cooking all the varieties required for them… He also must be eating something in order to work. Keep aside whether he is eating what he is making or if he is eating something else. Generally, people don’t like to eat what they make. It’s the “luck” of those eating. They survive or attain God’s grace. His [chef’s] people at home cook for him. When he goes home, he needs to eat his food. Doesn’t he? There is food that he takes in. There is food that he prepares for the other people.\nSimilar to how that’s essential… When you are living in the world, you must behave appropriately to the network formed due to bodily relations. Like you would need to work for nurturing the body… You must do something for yourself; the you who is different from the body. You must have nutrition for yourself. If there’s a pregnant lady, she eats for her nutrition and takes something for the baby too. Whatever is essential for the baby, she eats it. She makes a careful choice of suitable food for herself and for the indwelling baby. Similarly, living in this human body, every person works, earns, experiences, spends etc. for the body. He is responsible to do a little for himself too.\nWhat does ‘himself’ mean? It is one who gives chaitanya (consciousness) to the body. It is one who transmits knowledge enabling movements in the parts of the body. It is one who gives appropriate power to them. It is one who ensures that they are able to do different kinds of work. It is the underlying ji:va (soul) who is knowledgeable. He should also be given ‘nutrition’. His nutrition is not met with the elements that make up the body. His food is different. His activities are different. The body has different activities. Body is made of five elements of nature. It is that which does different activities based on the movements of three types of gunas (qualities). Hence, you must act with your body in accordance with that. Additionally, he must also be doing some work for himself. He is dwelling in the body to do a job. Human beings, if wise, will have a sense of responsibility to uplift themselves. We are all wise. So, we should reflect on that too.\nBhagavad Gita clarifies properly what we must do for our ujji:vana (upliftment), i.e. for a better state. God clearly explains it in brief in chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. From chapter 6 and 7 onwards, He elaborates it further purely focusing on it. Until chapter 6, He brings up that core aspect and takes it ahead. The path that we take for [uplifting] ourselves is called ujji:vana ma:rga (path of upliftment). What is required for this [body] is karthavya nishtta (devotion to duty) and karma a:charana (performance of actions). One must perform their duties. However, while doing one’s duties, how should he be doing them? He should clearly know what he is doing for this [body]. He should also know what it is that he is doing for himself. He should not mix up what he is doing for this body and for himself.\nWe alluded to this earlier. Despite holding both personal and other money in your hands, you cannot mix them up. If he is mixing up the office money with the rest, we know where he will be taken. He will be behind bars. He should know the difference between the two. This is his. It is his earning. This is for his expenses. This belongs to the office. It is the earnings of the office. It is for the expenses of the office. He should deal with them separately. He cannot combine them. If he combines them, then he has fallen into trouble. He clarifies this in chapter 3, verse 27.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprakruthe:h kriyama:na:ni gunaih karma:ni sarvasaha |\nahanka:ra vimu:dda:thma: kartha::ham ithi manyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll actions are performed by the qualities (gunas) of nature. The soul deluded by ego (ahanka:ra) thinks, 'I am the doer.'\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhoever becomes ahanka:ra grastha (afflicted by ego), forgets who he is due to ahanka:ra (ego)… Only he thinks that he is aham kartha (the doer), the one doing work done by the body. Others do not think that way. ahamkartha: ithi ahanka:ra vimu:da:thma manyathe: (The soul deluded by ego thinks, 'I am the doer'). What does a wise person think? prakruthe:h gunaihi kriyama:na:ni sarvasa (All kinds of work is done because of the qualities (gunas) of Nature). A wise person recognizes it. As long as he is recognizing it, he will be fine. He doesn’t need to be afraid of anyone. Otherwise, he will be living in fear every second.\nWe talked about three gunas (qualities) that Nature has: satthva, rajas and thamas. Like the spice that a chili has or the sour taste that a lemon has or sweetness that a mango fruit has. Nature has gunas (qualities). We call them dharmas (attributes): satthvamu, rajassu and thamassu. Because of the changes in these, we do activities. Sometimes we don’t like to do something. Sometimes we adore something highly. It is the effect of these that causes likes and dislikes [in a person]. What [guna] must be enhanced and what must be controlled can be worked out through practice. If one observes their signs carefully and practices accordingly, one can definitely control them to an extent. In chapter 3, God explains this too. He explains what to do. How and what to do? Firstly, know who you are. That’s the reason He taught the previous chapters.\nSome people in the world do not know this. Out of that ignorance, they mislead others. A wise one must learn, practice and ensure others are not misled. jo:shaye:th sarva karma:ni (inspire all to perform actions). “I know very well. So, I can behave the way I want”. This is not right. People follow you. Hence, work in a way that when they walk in your path, they are uplifted. An educated person can write alphabets with ease in any manner and it gets through. If a beginner must learn, he can’t learn it that way. Can he? When one wants to teach a beginner… The trainer must also sit properly, hold the pen properly, and write in the appropriate manner. The beginner will then follow. This is what He said earlier. When asked to inspire others, you cannot say, “Let them at least do something, be it right or wrong.” That is not called ‘inspiring others’.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\njo:shaye:th sarva karma:ni\nvidva:n yukthas sama:charan || 3.26\nSLOKA MEANING -\nA wise person, acting with devotion, should inspire others to perform all actions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nInspire the other person. Don’t deceive anyone. It does not mean that you pat and praise all his wrong acts. What is it that you must do? You must go down to his level and do all that he must do to reach your state. Try to uplift him properly. Don’t fall but go down voluntarily. It is necessary to go down to his stage to inspire him. So, go down and gradually uplift him. Only through that will you come out of their [satthva, rajas, thamas] effects. You can then come out of ahanka:ra (ego).\nWhat is ahanka:ra (ego) in fact? What does ahanka:ra (ego) do? What is ahanka:ra (ego) like? Why does one develop ahanka:ra (ego)? Only if you know about it…\nahanka:ra vimu:dda:thma:\nkartha::ham ithi manyathe: ||\n(The soul deluded by ego thinks, 'I am the doer.')\nOnly one who is filled with ahanka:ra (ego) thinks that he is the doer. What is ahanka:ra (ego)? What does it do? It is necessary to know what it is. Let us learn a little bit about it and then try to move forward.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

This becomes a pathway for their downfall.\nWhat is ahamkara? Sastra (scripture) uses ahamkara in various meanings. Prakriti (Nature) we see, is made of five elements. There is a state prior to this formation. The state is also called ahamkara. A seed is the state of a tree prior to its formation. The seed gets soaked, then becomes enlarged. Later, a white colored offshoot forms. Then, come roots. Later, branches emerge. It is then a sapling, and next matures into a big tree. We know of this process of change.\nSimilarly, there are some dravyas (elements) in the pre-stages of this vast universe. There are some tattvas (realities/principles). The tattvas grow gradually and spread. The process of their formation is explained. Let’s think of a stage similar to that of a seed. Such stages are given many names like avyakta (unmanifest), akshara (imperishable). Akshara is the initial stage. When it grows a little, it is called avyakta. Avyakta grows to a little further stage, i.e., like a seed that enlarges and begins to sprout. We are talking about the very early stages of the currently seen shape of Nature, not the current stage. It is then a tattva named Mahat tattva (great principle) that’s formed. Mahat tattva grows a little bit more. Like a sprout that gradually gives a growing white offshoot, pushing the seed downwards. Such tattva is called aham tattva (ego principle). It is also called ahamkara.\nFrom there, there is a split from which the trunk begins to form with a couple of leaves on either side. Later there is further growth and parts. Similarly, sattvika aham tattva (principle of goodness-ego), rajasa aham tattva (principle of passion-ego), and tamasa aham tattva (principle of ignorance-ego) emerge from aham tattva. The five elements of nature emerge from tamasa aham tattva. From sattvika aham tattva emerges the manas (mind) and indriyas (senses) which make the elements work. There is nothing that rajasika aham tattva gives but it brings the other two together. Like a pendulum whose movement from one side to another produces various sounds, rajasa aham tattva brings sattvika and rajasika ahamkara together. The union causes bodies to be formed by bringing together the five elements with mind and senses as necessary. Each body you see has the five elements, senses, and the mind. Mind is not enabled to function in some bodies. In some, it functions. Human beings have a working mind. Animals do not have functioning manas (mind) but they have very actively working senses. Senses work very well in all the animals. In human beings, both senses and the mind work.\nmana eva manushyanam (the mind alone is for human beings)\nManas (mind) is the most critical tool for every human being. Anyway, that is one aspect. We talked about the stage prior to all of this. It is Mula Prakriti (primordial Nature). Aham tattva is the stage prior to it. Before aham tattva split into three, it is the stage of Mahat tattva. The tattva that exists right before aham tattva splits into three is also called aham tattva or ahamkara. That is one of the meanings of ahamkara. Sastra (scripture) used it in the context of naming the tattvas (realities/principles).\nThere is another meaning to ahamkara. Because of education qualifications, or caste, or race, or skin color, or wealth or power, people tend to be very arrogant in their conduct. That is called ahamkara. It is also called mada (arrogance). Vidya mada (arrogance due to education), abhijana mada (arrogance due to many supporters), padavi mada (arrogance due to power) etc. There are many types of this but these are enough for now. When someone is arrogant, he does not care for anything. It does not matter if the other person is a guru, mother, or wife, or husband, or kids, or friends or supporters etc. He wants what he wants. That’s it. He does not mind doing anything to one who comes in between. This is called garvam (pride). We say that someone has developed a lot of pride. It is called mada (arrogance). This is also called ahamkara. This is a different state of a person’s character. It is the change in his character.\nWhen a soul’s knowledge gradually passes through certain types of dravyas (elements), like water that flows down from a mountain when it comes through red soil, it turns red. It hides the natural color and shows that of the other material. Similarly, a person develops an unexplainable extreme state when his knowledge carries some elements, while passing through certain paths. That is called ahamkara. He doesn't care for anyone. He thinks no one can match his state. He ‘walks’ on ‘raised’ platforms! Ahamkara. It is the extreme state of one of the qualities in a person. This is also called ahamkara.\nBesides these two meanings, it is also used to mean something else. It is the lack of an understanding. Behaving in a way not knowing the difference between what is aham (I) and what is mama (mine). That behavior is also called ahamkara. He is making that which is not aham (I) as aham (I).\nanaham aham kriyate (that which is not 'I' is made 'I')\nThat is called ahamkaram. Thinking that which is not aham (I) as aham (I) and behaving accordingly. If a common man behaves like a ruler, we call them a mad person. If a normal person, not even an extraordinary one, thinks of himself as God, he talks that way. He poses that way. He carries out his work also that way. Whatever he is not, he thinks of that as himself and behaves. He is also one type of a mad person. Behaving in a way thinking that he is that which he is not. In fact, this body is not us. We are not the body. It is ours. You should say ‘mama (mine)’.\nmama patram (my leaf)\nmama pustakam (my book)\nmama vastram (my clothes)\nIt means that it is mine. Whatever we say as mine is not us. It is associated with us. Is this body ours or us? We can all question this and reflect. We say that our body is not doing well, meaning our body is different from you. We say that our body is burning hot, meaning our body has increased temperature but not us. When someone says that, he is turning too hot. That’s different. Someone might say they feel very light today. That’s different. Someone might say that they feel very heavy. Someone might say they are feeling weak today. What are all these applicable to? They are not for ‘I’. They are for the body that belongs to ‘I’. If he uses medicine, he might say that his body feels much better that day. We say that the medicine worked very well. Body is not ‘I’, it is ‘mine’. That is different from you. Jiva (soul) is different from deha (body). Sharira (body) and shariri (one with the body). Deha (body) and dehi (one with the body). God explained this very clearly and elaborately in Chapter 2.\nWhen a person behaves without realizing the difference between the two, his knowledge is called ahamkara. This is not arrogance. This is not something resulting from high education or money, or power, or attitude etc. This is a lack of proper knowledge in a person. It is ignorance. It made him feel that he is the body. He thinks he is fat, thin, tall, short, colored, of a caste etc. None of these are applicable for a soul. All these are applicable for the body. When he ties himself up with what applies to the body, then he behaves according to the qualities of that. This behavioral tendency is wrong. It is that, which stepped out of its proper path. What that means is that his natural knowledge was covered by it. It masked the original knowledge of the soul. Because it is masked, all the activities he does will go in wrong paths. He would be hurting everyone like an animal with strong horns. Such a person…\nkarta aham iti manyate (thinks 'I am the doer')\nahamkara vimudhdatma (the deluded soul due to ego)\nNot realizing that he is not the one working, thinks himself as the doer of everything that’s happening. He thinks that it is because of him that everything is happening. What that means is that such a person gets closer to getting ‘destroyed’. Explaining this in 3.27, God is taking Arjuna forward. Let us also move ahead.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

We are traveling in the boat of Sri Krishna’s upadesha (teachings) that helps recognize our Self. In verse 27, Sri Krishna tells Arjuna - Prakriti (Nature) goes through many changes. You do not change. However, since you are with Nature, you are imposing its changes on yourself, thinking that you are it. This is what He says…..\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprakruthe:h kriyama:na:ni\ngunaih karma:ni sarvasaha |\nahanka:ra vimu:dda:thma:\nkartha::ham ithi manyathe: || 3.27\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll actions are performed by the qualities (gunas) of nature (prakriti). The soul, deluded by ego (ahankara), thinks, 'I am the doer.'\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe thinks he is the doer. How? Let’s place a mirror in front of ourselves. There is a color for the mirror. If there is a colored mirror, we look as if we are in that color. In fact, we are not in that color. The color belongs to the mirror. However, we project as if we are of that color. Similarly, we impose all the qualities of the body on ourselves and say that… We are of a specific type, specific race, specific caste, specific gender, specific age… In fact, the soul does not have gender, age, race or caste. He has only one [attribute], i.e. knowledge. Everything else is the changeable body formed by Nature. All the activities done in the body are also inspired by Nature.\nThe influx of sattva, rajas, and tamas (qualities of nature) are like the waves in the water. That causes various tendencies. These tendencies in turn cause something to grow and another to shrink. Like the fuel level that decreases as a car travels, when the body begins to move, the natural elements decrease. It could be the portion of earth, or water, or tejas (fire/light), or air, or akasha (space). The indwelling soul, i.e. we, recognize the increased and decreased levels of these because we are knowledgeable. We have the responsibility to maintain their quantities because the vehicle must move.\nFuel levels drop in the cars in which we travel. There are various types of fuel - petrol, diesel and their variants, etc. There is also something like grease for the machine to run. There is also water used as coolant for the radiator. There are all these different inputs. It’s dangerous for any of these to be under the required levels. So, it’s essential they get refilled. There are indicators when there is a need to refill. The indwelling Lord observes them as He is the captain of this flight. Because he is observing, the earth substance in the body demands refilling when low. This is called hunger. One will then get the right substance for refilling. What should he get? If the earth substance in the body needs a refill, that is exactly what he should be refilling it with. We can’t refill it with raw earth material as is. Some reptiles may survive on raw earth material. Humans don’t. We can’t eat raw soil itself. Some people say that pregnant women eat it at times. Put some things in it, sprout some things. Or make some bodies grow and eat them. Or some trees. Something like this. Both grow from the earth material. They grow by ‘eating’ what’s part of the earth material. He will therefore refill the body with that mrit dravya (earth material). Hunger gets satiated and he resumes work.\nSometimes, the level of water decreases through excretions. It could be through sweat, urination, or vapor. The indwelling soul observes. His knowledge recognizes change in movement when the level declines. There is an indicator that says the water level has come down. That is called thirst. He needs to refill water. What are the ways he uses to refill it is a different topic. He can refill water directly using water. Or convert it in the form of coffee, tea, any bottled drinks, etc. Something! He drinks and refills. It then resumes movement.\nAir, or tejas (fire/light), or akasha (space) substance levels may decrease. He continues to refill them. When akasha (space) substance level is low, it means that his ability to hear has weakened. He uses a hearing aid and then he begins to listen. He will now resume running the vehicle. This change is due to the substances of Nature.\nprakritehe gunaihi kriyamanani karmani (actions are performed by the qualities of nature)\nIf the one who should be using them thinks that he is them, what happens?! There is a driver in a car holding the steering and using the accelerator. He has quite a few things around him. He is not they. He is the one using them in driving the vehicle. If he recognizes this, then that’s ideal. If he doesn’t recognize this and thinks that he is the steering wheel and starts to rotate, we know what happens to the vehicle! A pilot of the flight understands the huge operating system in front of him and works with it. He should work the buttons and switches as per the need and carry on. He eats what he is supposed to and does his work while monitoring the system. The soul also must behave in the same way. He is different from the mechanism he runs. If the pilot thinks that he is the dashboard, it’s dangerous. He is not the dashboard. If he is the dashboard, he wouldn’t need to eat food. Isn’t the pilot eating and drinking? The crew supplies meals and water, on time, to the pilot as well. He too uses the washroom, etc. He is different from the system. The system should run as it should. He is different from it. He must get the work done through the system properly. In that case, he, along with the travelers, reaches the destination properly. Otherwise, it’s dangerous for him and the rest. In this body vehicle, we are the pilot. If we don’t ‘stay separate’ from it while running it, we will land ourselves in trouble. We will also cause trouble for those around us. This should not happen. This is what Sri Krishna’s upadesha (teachings) states!\nWhy is it happening that way? Because the soul thinks that the interfacing [body] is he. If a mirror is colored blue and if it thinks itself to be the color blue…? If it is colored red and if it thinks itself to be the color red…? This is happening because of one’s alochana (thought process). What are the natural qualities of water? Being cool and calm. These are the qualities. However, if you put some water in a vessel on the stove, what happens? The water gradually heats up - its coldness changes to hotness. It creates bubbles, releasing sound. It starts to release hot vapor. What happened? Why is water with all these qualities? Put the same water aside for sometime. The steam subsides. The boiling sounds stop. Movement decreases and the temperature returns back to cold. Why all of this? It is because of the touch of fire to the water. Water does not have those aforementioned qualities. Water took the heat from the fire through the vessel and became hot. Fire traveled through the vessel and touched the water. It started to separate the existing air molecules from it. That separation caused the air to leave the water as bubbles. There is an element called akasha (space). When it started to get released, we heard sounds. Despite not having these as natural qualities, the touch of fire makes water seem that it has those qualities.\nSimilarly, due to the touch of Nature through the body, the soul imposes qualities of Nature on itself. He thinks, “I am fair-looking.” Fair and dark are the color qualities of Nature. Smells are qualities of Nature. sound (shabda), touch (sparsha), form (rupa), taste (rasa), and smell (gandha). All of these are the dharmas (characteristics) of Nature - not of the soul itself. Similarly… Excitement, tranquility, ignorance, fatigue, and sleep are all not of the soul. These are formed due to the qualities of Nature. Just as water imposed some other qualities due to the touch with the vessel on fire… We are also imposing qualities of Nature. Water is not knowledgeable. Hence, it does not think whether the qualities are its own or not. Therefore, when the vessel is taken off from the stove, water returns to its original temperature. What about us? We are knowledgeable. Hence, we think. “This is me. This is mine.” We think we are Nature. We think the qualities of nature are ours. What happens then? What is not his is thought to be his.\nanaham aham kriyate ahankarah (that which is not the self is taken to be the self, that is ego)\nThis becomes so intensified that his svarupa (true nature) becomes covered. Once hidden, those other thoughts start to dominate. karta (doer) “I am the doer.” “When I do the work, I deserve the result.” Consequently, there is an expectation of the result. Why did the expectation of the result crop in? “I am the doer. Everything that’s happening with this is because of me.” He is thinking of himself to be something that he is not. Thus, he is thinking that what’s happening is because of him when that is not the case. It is happening because of someone else. The sun is rising. Is he doing so because of us? He is setting. Is that happening because of us? Air is flowing. Is it because of us? However, we think we are doing all of this by imposing everything on ourselves. He is imposing doership. He is expecting results. He is building a bond thinking that everything is happening because of him. Because of all these three…\nvimudhatma (deluded soul)\nlost the natural state. He gets into bhranti (illusion), and is facing gradual downfall. Explaining this, Sri Krishna clarifies to Arjuna the reason [for the trap of ahankara (ego)] in verse 3.27. He later speaks about how to come out of it. What should he do to emerge from ahankara (ego)? Lord gives a solution. What’s the use of only showing the disease? It’s essential to explain how to come out of it. God explains that as well in chapter 3. Let’s learn it.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nSome human beings are wise. Some are feeble-minded. What category shall we be part of? Shall we become wise or be part of the feeble-minded category? No one wants to be feeble-minded. Everyone desires to be wise. What should one do to become wise?\nIn chapter 3, Sri Krishna says subtly, “Carefully observe who is doing what.” As long as in this body, the body is the one working and you are driving it. You be yourself and let the one working be as itself. You notice how a supervisor gets work done with labor staff. Labor must work as labor. Supervisor must play his role as supervisor. If a worker acts like a supervisor, then the supervisor will have to quit. Supervisor can work like labor but must not forget his duty of supervision. He can work. It’s not wrong to work but he should not forget his existence.\nThe main reason for the struggle that human beings experience is ignorance. Forgetting their existence and identifying with the body. Today, we see the differences in race, caste, sect, color, etc. Human beings are confused with all types of differences they see amongst one another. These ‘innocent’ government officials are ‘taking care’ of all of these. Perhaps to feed themselves! In fact, for humans to live in health and joy, all these must be kept aside and… The proper functionality of the body should be recognized and a certain responsibility should be given. If this is done, no issues would arise. However… The nature of the person is kept aside and the form of the body is given importance. We see how many issues this is causing and how this is hampering growth and development.\nEarlier, as per scriptural count, there were 4 or 5 sects among human beings: Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. Today, there are thousands of such categories. In fact, what should be given importance? To them or to the functional aspect of the body? Should the importance be given to capability or such categorization? We are operating in an ignorant state, not knowing this! This is what feeble-mindedness does. Such a person will not only be feeble-minded himself, but also run his society and country similarly. We are witnessing this state today. However, our Elders have never encouraged this. They looked at the body as a body. They looked at the soul as the soul. They viewed the power of the soul as real power. Today, there is a need for society to recognize this.\nIn chapter 3, Sri Krishna mentions this. The body is that which is doing all the work, not you. The *kartha* (doer) is the body. It’s not you. You are *akartha* (not the doer). *Akartha* (not the doer) is one who is not the doer. It’s the underlying one making the ‘doer' work. He entered this body because of the effect of a *karma* (action) carrying certain responsibility. He must fulfill the responsibility through the body. Work must be done for the body and by the body. That responsibility must be kept on the body. However, what are we doing now? We are thinking we are doing the work. We are imposing all the results meant for the body on ourselves. Gradually, we fall victim to the bodies’ whims but we are not able to utilize the body as a tool for us. Should we work for the tool or should the tool work for us? This is the question. We should not go behind the tool running after it. The tool should work for us.\nExample: a cycle is a means/tool. Should we be carrying the cycle or should the cycle carry us? If we have to carry the cycle, it means the cycle is not of use. If we get rid of it, we can actually move with less burden. We can walk. There is no reason to carry it. Today, we are feeble-minded, carrying the tool on the top of our head. Sri Krishna says not to be like that. What does this feeble-mind do to someone? It makes one think that he is the ‘cycle’. That is termed *ahanka:ra* (ego).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nahanka:ra vimu:da:thma kartha:hamithi manyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe deluded soul, bewildered by ego, thinks \"I am the doer.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere is a wonderful episode in *Maha:bha:ratha* (Mahabharata) named *Yaksha Prasna* (Yaksha's Questions). *Pa:ndavas* (Pandavas) were in exile. Draupadi was thirsty. They climbed up a tree and looked around to see if there was water anywhere. It seemed like there was a water body in the distance. *Dharmara:ja* (Dharmaraja) was about to go fetch the water. The brothers asked him to wait. They set out to fetch water one after another. Firstly, Sahadeva being the youngest began. He did not return even after a long time. The second brother, third and the fourth, including *Bhi:mase:na* (Bhimasena), left. None returned. *Dharmara:ja* (Dharmaraja) wondered what happened. He had been told that it wasn’t too far. He left. When he reached, he saw a crane. The four brothers were lying on the ground. He didn’t know the reason. But he was also thirsty and was about to get some water. The crane stopped him and warned him. “If you answer my questions, you can drink the water or else, you will end up like your brothers.” He was shocked. A crane speaking, giving a warning! How amazing! He asked, “Who are you?” “Why do you need that detail?” it responded. “I will ask questions and if you answer, you will be able to get in. None of your brothers listened to me. Arrogantly, they tried to step in despite my warning. That is why they are in this state. You will also be in the same state if you don’t answer my questions. Watch out!” “If this is your area, it is not right for me to go against you. You ask. If I know, I will answer,” he said. The crane asked certain questions. Later, it was discovered to be a *Yaksha* (celestial being/spirit), *Yamadharmara:ja* (Yama, the god of death and justice) himself! He posed the questions. He was in the form of a *Yaksha* (celestial being/spirit). *Yamadharmara:ja* (Yama, the god of death and justice) asked the questions and *Dharmara:ja* (Dharmaraja) answered them. “You cannot ask me back any question after I ask a question. If you know, it’s a Yes. Otherwise No. Mostly, objective type questions. You cannot ask for any clarifications.” He asked many questions. One of the questions is… “What is the news?”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka: va:rtha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhat is the news?\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat news will someone in the forest know about? If someone is living in a town with a TV or a radio or a phone, they would know the happenings. What news will people living in the forest know about? He is not supposed to say that he does not have a way to know the news. If he knows, he should say what news there is. Or he should say that there isn’t any. *Yaksha* (celestial being/spirit) asked, “*ka: va:rtha:* (What is the news?)?” *Dharmara:ju* (Dharmaraja) is *buddhima:n* (a wise one). He answered it. It should be the news that never gets old. We all know of the time-boundedness of the news which we hear. They are not even worthwhile during the duration of a human’s life-span. The news shared now becomes stale very soon. It becomes old and useless. Or it stays current for a day or two. If *Yamara:ja* (Yama, the god of death) is asking, that means it should be something afresh all the time. What could that news be? He (*Dharmara:ja* (Dharmaraja)) is a great being. He answered it in the form of a *slo:ka* (verse).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nasmin maha: mo:hamaye: kata:he: su:rya:gni na:\nra:thri diva indhane:na\nma:sa ruthu dharvi: parighattane:na\nbhu:tha:ni ka:laha pachathi:thi va:rtha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn this great vessel of delusion, heated by the fire of the sun,\nwith day and night as fuel,\nand stirred by the ladle of months and seasons,\ntime cooks all beings – this is the news.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere is a large vessel. There are items being fried in it. There is fire heating it up from underneath and some things getting fried. *asmin maha: mo:hamaye: kata:he: su:rya:gni na:* (In this great vessel of delusion, heated by the fire of the sun). There are some fuels burning. *ra:thri diva indhane:na* (with day and night as fuel). There is someone heating it. Also, there are blazing flames. In the flames of day and night. *ma:sa ruthu dharvi: parighattane:na* (and stirred by the ladle of months and seasons). They are also holding a large ladle and they are turning them over. What are they? *ma:sa ruthu dharvi: parighattane:na* (stirred by the ladle of months and seasons). Who is cooking? And what are the substances that are used in the cooking? *bhu:tha:ni ka:laha pachathi:thi va:rtha:* (time cooks all beings – this is the news). One named *ka:la* (time) is properly cooking a dish named *bhu:thas* (beings). This is the news! Does this news ever age? Will *ka:la* (time) ever stop cooking the *bhu:tha:s* (beings)? *Ka:la* (time) will always cook the *bhu:tha:s* (beings). This will continue to be. New ones come, and old ones go. This repeats. This is like the flow of water. Like water is always visible while it is continuing to flow… Similarly with the *pra:ni ko:ti* (order of beings) - some leave and others take their place. It is an eternal flow. How is this happening? *bhu:tha:ni ka:laha pachathi:thi va:rtha:* (time cooks all beings – this is the news). *Ka:la* (time) is cooking these. With what? How does the *ka:la* (time) change? In the form of day, week, fortnight, month, season, 6 months, year… This is how it is passing. He is using this to move them. What is the fuel that’s burning? *ra:thri diva indhane:na* (day and night as fuel). What’s the fire that it’s yielding? *su:rya:gni na:* (by the fire of the sun). The *The:jas* (radiance/energy), by the name of *Surya* (Sun), is burning. What is this? *asmin maha:mo:hamaye: kata:he:* (in this great vessel of delusion). It is a *ba:na* (vessel/pot), a large frying vessel called *ahamka:ra* (ego). It is a large vessel. He placed all of these in that *ba:na* (vessel/pot) and is cooking them. He is *ka:la* (time), *Yama* (god of death). How amazing! This cooking never ends. This news is ever-fresh. What needs to happen? One needs to step out of the vessel known as *ahamka:ra* (ego). In chapter 3, Sri Krishna explained how one can become free of it. What happened to *Dharmara:ju* (Dharmaraja) is discussed in *Bha:ratha* (Mahabharata). From *Bhagavad Gi:tha* (Bhagavad Gita), if we know about the vessel that we are being cooked in… We can think about how to use it properly and successfully emerge from it. Let’s listen and make effort.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nChapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita qualifies and explains the bha:vana (process of reflection) that one should have. In the three verses 3.27, 3.28 and 3.29, God says…\nBecause the body is the primary doer of the activities, we must leave the doership on it. Or, because God is the underlying cause of all that’s happening, the doership must be left with Him. It should be left on this or that side. If you leave it with God, He will own the responsibility. Or if you leave it with prakruthi (Nature), you will be free from that responsibility. Do one of the two. This is the summary of chapter 3.\nIn chapter 3 it is explained… We see prakruthi (Nature) right in front of us. We see the body. We see the products of natural elements forming the body like food, water, air, etc. We can clearly see all of this. This [body] is growing and shaping because of them. Recognize that they are the direct cause. Because of changes in them, different activities and works happen. Thinking this way, you can leave the responsibility on that side. He conveys ‘leaving of responsibility on prakruthi (Nature)’ in verses 3.27, 3.28 and 3.29.\nAfter recognizing this fact, we develop further understanding about prakruthi (Nature) - that it is ache:thana (non-sentient). It is not knowledgeable. We are knowledgeable. How can one that is not knowledgeable govern the knowledgeable? If you can think of this and recognise it to this extent, then He says that the underlying thatthva (reality/underlying principle) is He. “Leave the responsibility with Me,” He says in verse 3.30. Let’s look at how this is said in those verses.\nIn verse 3.27…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprakruthe:h kriyama:na:ni\ngunaih karma:ni sarvasaha |\nahanka:ra vimu:dda:thma:\nkartha::ham ithi manyathe: || 3.27\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll actions are performed by the qualities (gunas) of Nature (Prakruti). One whose mind is deluded by ego thinks, \"I am the doer.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nPrakruthi (Nature) has certain qualities. We talked about these earlier. Sattva, rajas and thamas. Because the body is made of prakruthi (Nature), it also has the same three qualities. They don’t stay in a constant form all the time. If constant, it implies the final moment. It is called pralaya (dissolution). If the three qualities in Nature attain a constant state, it is called pralaya (dissolution). What that means is that this entire setting comes to a state of completion. These qualities don’t have a constant state. They have a changing composition going up and down like ocean waves. One is high, the others go low. If sattva rises, rajas and thamas decline. If rajas increases, sattva and thamas subside. If thamas grows, sattva and rajas shrink. This occurs constantly. This is the cause for the world’s continuing existence. Because of this, there is constant activity occurring in this world.\nSimilarly with the body. There are the same sattva, rajas and thamas components within it. There is activity in the body because of the ongoing change of highs and lows across these three. They happen due to the effect of the indwelling soul’s knowledge. They also undergo those changes due to their natural movements. Where’s the issue here?! The indwelling soul assumes responsibility thinking that he is the doer and that he is the cause. It adds to his karmic load. In verse 3.28 He says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthatthvavitthu maha:ba:ho:\nguna karma vibha:gayo:ho |\nguna:gune:shu varthanthe:\nithi mathva: na sajjathe: || 3.28\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBut he who knows the truth, O mighty-armed one, about the divisions of qualities (gunas) and actions (karma), understanding that the qualities (gunas) act upon the qualities (gunas), does not become attached.\n-----------------------------------------------\nna sajjathe: (he won’t be tied to it). What is ‘it’? guna karma (qualities and actions). When? guna:gune:shu varthanthe: ithi mathva: (understanding that the qualities act upon the qualities). There is satthva in [the body] here, there is satthva outside [in Nature]. There is rajas here as well as externally. There is thamas here and in Nature. The thamas here desires more of the thamas from outside. The rajas here desires more of the rajas from outside. The satthva here desires more of the satthva from outside. These interact with those..\nWhen we are traveling, people of similar nature tend to come into groups. Those who have the habit of drinking seem to form a group. Those with the habit of gambling tend to form a separate group. Doctors come together as a group. Same for advocates. Whatever profession or nature one holds, they tend to come together and share. Similarly with nature! Satthva here desires external satthva. Rajas desires for rajas. Thamas desires for thamas. When this activity is happening, if he thinks it is him, the result of the activity is recorded on him. If he doesn’t think that way, it gets recorded in Nature.\nGenerally dwelling in here, when there is a feeling that you are the doer… You end up questioning why the result should go to someone else… You will desire the result of that activity. Consequently, there is an imprint of karma va:sana (tendencies from past actions) on the ji:va (soul), i.e. himself. The effect of karma va:sana (tendencies from past actions) gives rise to various ruchis (tastes). Accordingly, that sets forth the body with a certain pravrutthi (instinct). One tends to desire objects that align with that instinct. This is a never ending routine that happens with this body.\nBecause of the effect of gunas (satthva, rajas and thamas), karma (activity) begins. Because of the karma (activity), there are va:sanas (records) that accumulate. Because of the effect of va:sanas (records), he is re-entering here in another body. If he has higher satthva, he gets a sa:tthvic (pure/good) birth. If he has higher rajas, he gets a ra:jasic (passionate/active) birth. If he has higher thamas, he gets a tha:masic (ignorant/dark) birth. The reason for these births is his connection with karma (actions), the tendencies with karma (actions). The underlying reason for karma (actions) is his attachment with the gunas (satthva, rajas and thamas).\nWhy is this happening? When he is working with the body, he lacks clarity about why and how things are happening. We use a pen to write something. What is it that which is writing? Is it the pen, the hand or ink? What is it that is writing? If there is no ink, nothing can be written. Ink is the reason. However, if we pour ink directly [onto paper], nothing gets written. Unless there is a carrier like a refill, ink doesn’t flow properly in order to write something. We don’t use refills alone. We set them in pens and then write. If we set the pen, refill it, and arrange all of these properly, still nothing gets written. We must hold it and move it in the right direction. Only then something gets written.\nAmong these, who should we establish the doership with? The pen, ink, refill, hand, or ourselves? We can put it on any of them. If we say that we are the ones thinking about writing something properly, doership can be put on us. There is no burden on the hand, pen, etc. If one wants to write but his hand is shivering, he doesn’t leave the responsibility on the hand. He takes it on himself. Or if the pen isn’t working well, he tries to get a new pen. Or if there is an issue with the refill, he tries to rectify it. Or if there is no ink, he tries to replenish it. He does so because he knows the swabha:va (nature), and swaru:pa (form), of the pen. He doesn’t get upset with the pen, refill, ink, or hand. A wise one doesn’t get angry at any of them. Because everything works in accordance to the extent and the way its swaru:pa (form) permits. He [the wise one] understands this. He uses another means. He attempts to write with it. Or he takes help from some other writer.\nWhen? When he understands thatthva (reality). What thatthva (reality)? That of the pen! If he understands the thatthva (reality), he will neither praise, nor get upset with anything. He will think of the process to get the work done. If he does not understand the thatthva (reality), he will either keep blaming the pen or get himself messy with ink. Or if his hand is at fault, he will blame it. There’s no use of blaming the hand, pen or the ink. It is important to focus on the activity that needs to happen. What does he do? The pen is not functioning well. So, he will replace it with a new one. If the refill is not, he will look at replacing the refill with a new one. If the ink is not the right type, he will try to get the proper ink. Or he might take the help of another person. We know this.\nWhen does that happen? thatthva vith (one who knows the truth). In the case of a pen, he will take action because he understands the thatthva (reality) of the pen. It’s the same with any object. Likewise, he needs to know the thatthva (reality) of the body. Body is panchabhu:thmakam (made of the five elements in nature). It is thriguna:thmakam (having three qualities) [satthva, rajas, thamas]. Hence… The reason for the tendencies of the activity happening in it are the gunas and the natural elements. guna:gune:shu varthanthe: ithi mathva: (understanding that the qualities act upon the qualities). They are behaving in accordance with them, and hence, he will be able to leave the responsibility on them. He will be able to stay away from its results.\nOr if he can see God beyond prakruthi (Nature)… Meaning if he knows that he is there within the visible body, and that God is one operating him… He can leave the responsibility on Him. He will be able to stay away from the gunas. Because, He is able to run everything. If he tries to handle everything, it may not be possible. guna:gune:shu varthanthe: ithi mathva: (understanding that the qualities act upon the qualities). Only who recognises this will be able to stay away from this attachment. One who is always focusing on them and leading life with them cannot do it. He explains this in verses 3.27 and 3.28. He, Sri Krishna, is trying to clearly explain topics related to the tendencies that the body acts on. Let us also try to learn.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nMake proper use of the human body. Utilize knowledge appropriately. Attain good goals. This is the purpose of the human body. It is not given solely for experiencing. The soul is not given a human body to limit its purpose for wealth accumulation and experiences, only to leave after some time. All the variety of bodies formed in Nature are for the purpose of indwelling souls. Every soul has got a body with a purpose. It got it because God has embodied it. It is the responsibility of the indwelling soul to fulfill the purpose of the body for which it was given. He (the soul) has to guide the work. He should know this and act accordingly with the body.\nHowever, only human beings have the opportunity to get this knowledge. It’s not for others. If you gather cows, dogs, foxes, etc., and tell them that this is what one should do with this body, they wouldn’t be able to understand and behave accordingly. However, God gave a developed state [of mind] to humans for behaving accordingly. That is why ‘teachings’ are also aimed at human beings only. The body is not for simple experiences, but rather for qualified experiences to reach the ultimate goal.\nWhat is the goal? Release from karma bandha (bondage due to actions). The soul here is in a bondage. It is called karma bandha (bondage due to actions). The goal is to become released from it. This body is to support one in reaching that goal. This is a priceless body. It is more valuable and precious when compared to all other bodies. Because only this body has the mechanics to utilize the wonderful manas (mind) and buddhi (intellect). Other bodies do not have this. There are senses for all other beings. They work well. They work in different ways. However, the ability to think of the goal and act accordingly is only given to human bodies. Meaning it’s valuable. The most valuable of all vehicles.\nFor example, assume that reaching Delhi is our goal. We might currently be somewhere in Chennai or Hyderabad, and the goal is to reach Delhi. What is the means that we can use to reach properly? We think about it. We can go on foot or cycle or by auto rickshaw or train. Each is a means to travel. There are some that go fast, some slow, others at medium pace. We don’t know how long it will take to walk. There may be a number of issues while walking. All others are similar. There is not much hassle with trains but it still takes considerable time. An airplane is the fastest vehicle. Yet, it’s also expensive. There are also many good facilities provided. You will be asked to fasten your seat belt. Someone will offer you chocolate, coffee, tea, etc. They will provide you with pricey amenities. However, does anyone board the plane because there are fancy facilities on it? If we are asked to deboard after the amenity service and before reaching the destination, do we consider it a good vehicle? We are not boarding for the facilities, but rather for reaching the destination. There will be certain facilities in the path of reaching one’s destination. Yet, we must not focus on the facilities at the cost of risking the goal. Yet, it is not necessary to reject the facilities provided. If necessary, we use them. Or else, we don’t. In either case, the primary goal is to reach the destination. The goal shouldn’t be about spending a huge amount to buy the ticket.\nThe human body is also the same. It is the most able of all bodies. When this body is given, we must do certain work. There are a variety of facilities that come with it. Nature provides us with facilities for food, vacation, or general affairs. What are we doing these days? We only live for these! We are satiated with those facilities. We focus on enhancing the experience of those facilities. However, we have forgotten the goal. One who wants to board a vehicle has a goal of reaching a specific destination. Similarly, what is the goal of a jiva (soul) that ‘boarded’ the human body? It is to get released from karma bandha (bondage due to actions) that has formed. This is the goal of life. We entered Nature and have been traveling in the cycle of birth and death. Taking birth and dying happen all the time. We must break and emerge from this trend. We must attain a state where we don’t need to take birth, die, or go through these tough times. This is the reason for providing us with this tool [human body]. We have put that aside. We have got engrossed in providing comfort and facilities for this [human body]. Is there a home for this? Is there a vehicle for this? Is there enough wealth for this? Are there people providing facilities for this? We are limiting our thoughts to this level. Akin to satiating oneself with facilities provided on the plane, forgetting our destination.\nMaharshi says, “This [body] is also a great wealth. Do you know why it’s given?” This is a very strange, surprising and joyous question. This is called deha sampatthi (bodily wealth). This is a very strange one, he says.\nSLOKA WORD -\nvichithra: de:ha sampatthihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis bodily wealth is very strange.\nWhen was this formed?\nSLOKA WORD -\npu:rvame:va krutha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt was formed long ago.\nNot today, it’s been in formation for some time. Because he (the soul) is not able to use it properly, he is not reaching his goal and is roaming around here. He reaches the human body, then again into an insect or fly. Again, he moves forward to the human body and falls. He forgot that he must come out of this. How did this get formed?\nSLOKA WORD -\nhastha pada:di samyutha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt’s been formed with proper equipment to get work done, with hands, legs, etc.\nIt’s been formed with proper equipment to get work done. With hands, legs, etc. - a beautiful process to use them properly. Why? What is the goal?\nSLOKA WORD -\ni:svara:ya nive:dithum\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFor submission to God.\nThis is formed for submission to God, i.e., every work is to be done as service through this. But we have forgotten that. We are working, we are acquiring wealth, and experiencing. However, we forgot that the experiences are to be submitted to God. We understood a way to use the body, but not its full capacity. Therefore, we are not called tattva vit (knower of realities). We are half-learned. We don’t know the rest. We learnt that this is a wonderful tool. We learnt we can use it very well. We learnt there are many facilities in it. We limited our knowledge to that extent. This is not right. The experiences are for the goal of attaining God. So, the experiences are for submitting to Him.\nSLOKA WORD -\ni:shvara:ya nive:dithum\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFor submission to God.\nIf we know this, we will be able to bear the difficulties and losses caused due to the body. Otherwise, we cannot bear them. In fact, all of these are not for the body. While we are working, there will be the touch of heat, cold, etc. during the process. That’s inevitable. We will be able to handle the pleasures and pains, i.e. the cold and heat waves, etc. when we know the goal. Otherwise, we will end up running behind them, forgetting the actual goal. Currently, that is what’s happening. We forgot the goal. We understood very well the facilities that we can have. How can we increase these further? How can we protect them properly? How can we use our knowledge to experience them even better? Instead of using knowledge on the other side, we are using it on this side of things. So, what’s happening to us?\nSLOKA WORD -\nsajjanthe: guna karmasu\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWe are being tied with the gunas (qualities of nature) and the resulting activities.\nWe are getting entangled with them. Instead, what should we be doing? He [God] clarified it. Take things to the extent they are necessary. Yes. If you are hungry, eat because you have to eat something. If you are thirsty, drink as you need to. But, why focus on the drink? When traveling on the airplane, because you shouldn’t dehydrate, they give you some water or another beverage. If you feel the need, have them to the extent you need. Sometimes we noticed back in those days on airplanes, they would bring some peppermint sweets on a plate and offer them before the plane takes off. Some would take more than a handful and stuff them in the pockets. Why? You can buy them on the street later. They were provided to ease your travel while taking off. Use one or two to that extent. There is more focus on these than on the actual goal. Sometimes, people fight for these. This is something that an atattva vetta (one who does not know the purpose of things) does. Meaning this is something done by those who do not know the purpose of things. That is why, God says…\nSLOKA WORD -\nthatthvavitthu maha:ba:ho:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who knows the truths and the goal as they are, O mighty-armed one.\nOne who knows the difference between gunas (qualities of nature) [sattva, rajas, and tamas] and karma (actions). That person will clearly recognize the need, the extent of the need and limits properly.\nSLOKA WORD -\nna sajjathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThen, he will not be attached to it.\nThen, he will not be attached to it. He will be able to gradually move towards the goal. Sri Krishna is teaching us our svabhava (nature) in verse 3.29. He is leading us forward. Let’s move ahead learning it.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "episode": 72,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nTalking about us, Bhagavad Gita chapter 3 categorizes the wise humans into two groups. One is kruthsna-vith (one who has properly and fully learned what needs to be learned) and the other is akruthsna-vith (one who has learned only half of it).\nIn verse 3.29, Sri Krishna says:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprakruthe:he guna sammu:dda:ha\nsajjanthe: guna karmasu |\ntha:n akruthsna vido: manda:n\nkruthsnavith na vicha:laye:th ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose deluded by the qualities of nature become attached to actions. A wise person (kruthsnavith) should not disturb these ignorant ones (akruthsnavith).\n-----------------------------------------------\nNature and its qualities are those which must be properly used as fuel for progress. Depending on the quality of fuel, the vehicle moves to that extent. The journey will be that smooth. If the fuel is contaminated, the vehicle will have to undergo a lot of repairs and get damaged. The journey will not succeed in reaching the destination. We all know this. However, some fill it with contaminated fuel. They do not consume natural elements in the manner they should be taken. Because of that, this human body vehicle also needs repairs.\nSome people want to get better for a smoother journey and put in effort. But, they aren’t able to make the necessary effort because of the effect of past va:sana (imprints of tendencies). Because of the effect of karma (actions/deeds) from the past. Sri Krishna named them as akruthsnavith (one who has learned only half of it).\nkruthsna vith (one who has properly and fully learned what needs to be learned)\nakruthsnavith (one who has learned only half of it)\nOne who has learned half the knowledge cannot reap the full benefit. One who has learned it fully will be able to use it properly. Even if there is some fault with the fuel or tool, he will be able to steer it towards the goal. If one doesn’t know properly that it [body] is meant for the goal, he will end up ruining it.\nSay, for example: A person installed a high-power engine in a vehicle. He took it on the highway. What should he do? He should operate it at the speed legally allowed. He takes it on some other roads in a village. There will be speed-limit boards - such as 20 mph or 40 mph or 70 mph or 100 mph. He should follow the instructions of that specific path. If he goes 5 mph in a 100 mph zone, he will be in trouble and also disturb others. There might be a fast moving vehicle that hits him and his car will be damaged. Conversely, just because a vehicle is able, if one travels at 100 mph or 200 mph in a 5 or 10 mph zone… He will end up running into many things, causing danger to himself and others.\nNot only does one need to know how to drive the vehicle but he also needs to know the rules of the vehicle and the path. When he knows all these comprehensively, he is called kruthsnavith (one who knows very well). It is a Sanskrit word, meaning one who knows very well. To give a simple example, it means one who knows the rules of driving. When he knows the rules, he will drive as per the vehicle, speed, road, and the rules of the road. He will have to drive that way.\nThe human body is enabled with a high-power engine. [In our analogy] This vehicle is enabled to be driven on a ring-road with a 150 mph speed limit! How does it make sense to take it on narrow roads like you would on that other path? It is dangerous for him and the rest. A human being must behave as a human being. Let’s say other animals symbolize roads with lower limits. Such as goats, dogs, rats, cats, mosquitoes, flies, etc. These bodies are the roads which have their respective limits. The human body is a vehicle with a chance to be driven on a wonderful highway. Because it has come on such a path, it should be driven accordingly. Because we don’t know how to drive it, Sri Krishna has come to teach us.\nWhat is He saying here?\nguna:gune:shu varthanthe:\nithi mathva: na sajjathe:\n“The gunas (qualities) in nature and in the body are traveling together.”\n“I have no responsibility for this.”\nYou must recognize this. Then, you won’t be tied down to it. However, what we are doing is thinking that this is all us, for us, and because of us. We feel that every work that’s done wouldn’t have been possible without us. Everyone feels that if they don’t wake up and begin their activities, the Sun won’t rise. They feel the Sun won’t set. Everyone feels it. Great beings ruled the nation. They left. Nothing stopped. Common people also ruled. They also left. Yet, the country didn’t come to a halt. If we ask one to shift to a different task, people feel that nothing will progress if they leave. They feel as if the entire global show will shut down. Everyone feels the same way, young and old. I have it [this feeling] at the level that I am at. Others at their respective levels. People say an elephant has gas in its stomach in relation to its body size. A mosquito, a fly, a human being also has stomach gas in relation to their body size.\nAhanka:ra (ego/false identification), thinking that we are that which we are not. Due to this, we are imposing doership on ourselves. Because we are imposing on ourselves, we are experiencing the effects. He said this in verse 3.27 earlier:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nahanka:ra vimu:dda:thma:\nkartha::ham ithi manyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe soul deluded by ego thinks, \"I am the doer.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nComing to verse 3.28, He says… If you can live without imposing doership on yourself… Don’t impose it on yourself. Then, where should the doership be positioned? Let it be where it is supposed to be. Let it be put on the cause of the work happening. Look around and understand that things are happening because of Nature and the play of its elements. You will then be able to stay from it. Prakruthi (nature) has gunas (qualities). Gunas (qualities) are making one do karma (actions). Because of karma (actions), bodies are in activity. Bodies, gunas (qualities) and Nature are all interrelating with one another.\nguna: gune:shu varthanthe: (Qualities act among qualities.)\nThen, you will be free from their effect on you. You can do that. If you can do that, you will not be tied to it.\nna sajjathe: (one does not become attached)\nIn verse 3.29… Not everyone will be in such a matured state. What do we do then? Let one take small steps. Don’t blame or scold one because he doesn’t know. If we know something well, it is our responsibility to teach the one who really doesn’t know it. Why should God teach Arjuna all this? Why should He teach this for the human race? He could just choose to not do it. He could think that people will reap the effect of their karma (actions) and not bother. He could sit idle. Because He is one with a manas (mind), He can’t leave it that way. He feels that everyone should benefit. Everyone is eligible for attaining the same level of joy that He is. He feels pity on us for that reason. He wants to teach and help us grow.\nWe see kids. We are able to walk properly and even run. We can run forward, backward and sideways. Because we are used to walking and have gained full practice. We are able to move in all directions. However, consider a 1 or 1.5 year old kid who tries to stand up and falls. He tries and tries but he falls. Because he is falling, do we scold or hit or discourage the kid and leave him? He is akruthsnavith (one who doesn't know it all well). He doesn’t know it all well. We must encourage and teach him. If he walks a couple of steps, we must clap and encourage. Hold his hand and give him support. Then, make him walk another two steps. He may fall again. Help him get up and make him try again.\nWhen one is learning to write alphabets, he holds the chalk on the slate and tries. He could be moving it in all directions. Do we scold the kid that he is spoiling it all and wasting time, hitting him left and right? We sit with him patiently. We write along with him a hundred times to make him write once properly. He is akruthsnavith (one who doesn't know it all well). He is trying to write it well and properly. Don’t accept whatever he does. Don’t praise him for whatever he does, just because he is doing something. That is wrong. Many say, ‘Let them do it...at least it’s something.’ No. It is the responsibility of a kruthsnavith (a fully learned one), to teach the process that must be followed. It is the responsibility of a thatthva ve:ttha (one knowledgeable of realities). Try to teach the thatthva (reality/truth) to one who does not know it. Encourage him to that extent. That is what He is saying in verse 3.29.\nWhoever is getting tied to karma (actions) because they do not know how to work… With such a person…\ntha:n akruthsna vidaha kruthsnavith na vicha:laye:th || (A wise person should not disturb these ignorant ones.)\nDon’t scold him, making him feel that he does not ever want to try writing again. However, if he is scribbling, don’t let him do that either. What should you do? Teach him what to write and how to write. Teach him 10 times or 100 times if needed. It’s okay.\njo:shaye:th (motivate)\nMany say this when it comes to the topic of God. “We pray to everyone.” This is not right. God clarified this in Bhagavad Gita. “I am the only One.”\nma:m e:kam saranam vraja (Surrender to Me alone)\nYou should not say that it’s okay to do something rather than nothing. Teach him the right way. If he doesn’t get it, teach and repeat gradually. Don’t let him do whatever he does. Don’t scold. Teach the right process. In verse 3.29, He moves forward explaining how a learned one must teach those who are not.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nThere are two types of human beings. One is wise. Others are feeble-minded, i.e. slow learners. The wise comprehend things faster. If we tell them something, they grasp quickly and move forward accordingly. However, some cannot grasp quickly but they may desire to be quick. Due to the deficiency in intellectual ability, they can’t grasp it in one go. They may need to be told 2, 3, 10, 50 or 100 times as needed. The responsibility of the wise is to take the feeble-minded also along with them. “Because I can walk fine, I will go all by myself.” This is not the quality of a human being. The goal of a growth seeker should be to move forward with everyone together. Such people are referred to by God as kruthsnavith (one who has learnt everything properly).\nWhat did he learn? The thatthvas (realities). Meaning he knows the essential nature of everything. Meaning one who knows about the things as they are. thatthva (reality). One who has learnt the swaru:pa (essential form) and swabha:va (vital nature) of things as they are. Such a person is called thatthva vith (one who knows the realities). If one knows comprehensively, he is called kruthsna vith (one who has learnt everything properly). vith (one who knows), ve:tthi (one who knows). One who knows the thatthvas (realities) comprehensively can be called thatthva vith (one who knows the realities) or kruthsna vith (one who has learnt everything properly). The rest are athatthva-vith (not learned in the realities as they are). They have also not learnt fully, akruthsna vith (not learnt fully). That’s how He referred to them in verses 3.28 and 3.29.\nHow does it help one if he knows? He will be able to move ahead in life properly. What happens if one does not know this? He will be at a loss. We all know that some work very hard at exam time. If, for some reason, one does not get expected marks, or he fails, he would be so devastated as if there were nothing else worthwhile in life. He wants to commit suicide or succumbs to depression. We have heard many such cases where one goes through such problems. Let’s say someone tries to secure a job somewhere and he fails. He is so disappointed that he ends up committing suicide unable to tolerate pain. Someone had to catch a train, car or some kind of vehicle to go somewhere and he missed it. Some issue with ticketing or by the time he reached, the gates might have closed. Something like that happened. He gets extremely upset and depressed. We see these happening. What is the reason? He does not have a comprehensive understanding of what needs to be known. When he writes the exam, it’s not for the exam. He does not know that he is not born only for the exam. He is not studying just for the exam. He wants to resume his normal activities after completing the exams. If it is not this attempt, there is a next time. What’s the big deal? Try harder next time or get trained from someone who is more knowledgeable. He should think this way and move forward. What’s the use of getting disappointed because of what has already been done?\nA farmer worked very hard tilling the soil, planting saplings, with fertilizers, and it’s now time for yield. Right about that time, a big storm occurred. Sadly, the entire farm land was submerged and the crop was destroyed. What does he do? Should he take his life feeling disappointed? He will think about the ways to overcome the loss. He restarts cultivating the farm. That is why we are getting proper food to eat. If the farmer gets disappointed, it would be difficult to feed the world. Similarly, the one who fails in exams once, must work hard and try again. He must attain the result. He wrote the exam for working on something post the result. He must focus on that work and move forward. When failing to achieve what one sets out for, he generally falls into depression. This is a result for someone who is not a thatthva ve:ttha (knowledgeable of realities as they are).\nHow should one who knows well behave? He should tell the other person. He must make sure the other person realizes the truth. He must ensure that the other person acts properly. He should teach him what the easier and effective methods are. He shouldn’t discourage him instead, by saying… “You are made for this! You said you would pass..see what happened!” “You did a ‘great’ thing!” He should not use harsh words, or discourage him and make him feel disappointed. A wise one must realize this. That is how he should be. How do we refer to him? He is someone who has realized realities. kruthsnavith (one who has learnt everything properly). “You worked very hard without getting the expected result. That’s okay.” “Study harder next time and you can pass.”\nOne is traveling somewhere. Mid way, the car gets a flat tire. Can that person sit there saying his life is over? He shouldn’t. There is a flat tire. That’s okay. We must reach the destination. Let’s use another means. Let’s try. Let’s repair the current one or use another vehicle to continue the journey. He should try this but he can’t. One who can’t do this is called akruthsnavith (not learnt fully). Such a person is called feeble-minded. A wise one should show the right path to such a person.\nSwami says in verse 3.29…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprakruthe:r guna sammu:dda:ha\nsajjanthe: guna karmasu |\ntha:n akruthsna vidaha manda:n\nkruthsnavith na vicha:laye:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose who are deluded by the qualities (gunas) of nature (prakruthi) become attached to actions and their results. The wise (kruthsnavith) should not disturb or discourage these less knowledgeable (akruthsnavith) and slow-learning (manda) individuals, but rather guide them forward.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhoever feels that his life is over just because there is a flat tire, or he has failed an exam… Or one who feels his life is over because he started an activity that did not progress for a reason… Such a person is… sajjanthe: guna karmasu (He had tied himself only to that extent with that work). Such a person… prakruthe:r guna sammu:dda:ha (He tied himself with prakruthi (nature) and the gunas (qualities) of the prakruthi (nature)). In fact, he needs to see the three separately. He needs to see prakruthi (nature), the indwelling self and underlying God. Instead, he sees prakruthi (nature) and the qualities (gunas) of prakruthi (nature). He sees himself with them. He thinks they are him and he is them. He got tied to it there. sajjanthe: guna karmasu (He does not have comprehensive knowledge). He is called akruthsnavith (not learnt fully). tha:n akruthsna vidaha manda:n (those who are not fully knowledgeable and are slow learners). manda:n (slow learner). He will learn slowly if you teach him. kruthsnavith na vicha:laye:th (Don’t stop him from trying. Don’t make him feel discouraged. You should encourage and take him forward).\nWhen we were young and learning under tutelage at Nadigaddepalem Asramam… There were many students. One student could not grasp the content no matter how many times he tried. Despite reciting 100 times, he wouldn’t get it. He thought he was not able to do it during day time due to everyone being around. There was a big well in the asramam. There was a raised spot at the edge. There was also a rod above it that had a bucket. Earlier, people would draw water using it. There was also a lamp there. To learn under the light of the lamp, he would go and sit there with folded legs to study. Everyone would get scared. We would say, “You might trip and fall. If you fall, we will all get scolded.” He wouldn’t listen. He would sit there only. Why? If he fell asleep even for a second, he would fall into the well. That is why he would sit there. He wanted to stay awake all night and study! He would recite two to three hundred times. He would have it memorized by the morning. However, he would forget by the next afternoon. He was a slow-learner. He was not at fault with the goal he had. His determination level was not at fault. His efforts were not at fault. What can we do? It’s a slow engine. It is an old engine with 5 horsepower. Others have an engine of 50 horsepower. Those work faster. His engine works slow. You should encourage him too. na vicha:laye:th (do not discourage). We should not scold or discourage or make him upset. We should take them along with us. This should be a goal.\nSwami is teaching this in Bhagavad Gita. Why is He saying this? Two! We are in the middle of the two. One side is prakruthi (nature), i.e. prakruthi (nature) in the form of the body. Second is God. He is not talking about Him. He is talking about prakruthi (nature). Because it is harder for us to see Him than to see the prakruthi (nature). We don’t even know ourselves. What we are seeing is prakruthi (nature). He probably thought of teaching how to realize and focus on what’s visible first. He probably desired to shift our focus on Him after that. That is why, He has made us understand prakruthi (nature), its swabhava (vital nature) and its swaru:pa (essential form). Prakruthi (nature) is of this nature. Because of it, several kinds of moods arise. Because of this, we do certain work. If we tie ourselves to the work saying kartha: aham (I am the doer)… Then… ahanka:ra vimu:da:thma (one whose self is deluded by ego). We get tied to it. So, don’t put these on yourself. Gunas (qualities) are working with gunas (qualities). Hence, leave the doership with them. Encourage in the same way. Encouragement is important. This is what He is teaching in verse 3.29. He is taking Arjuna forward, teaching him how to progress in life. Let us also learn and try to move forward.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is the supreme scriptural teaching that guides human beings on the right way to live. Bhagavad Gita touches upon all subjects of life. It explains how life moves - and advises on what’s the best way to lead it. It elaborates on both.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSome things we do in life are good while some are bad. It teaches us how to stop doing bad deeds. It teaches us how to do good deeds. In fact, we don’t agree to take on the doership of the bad deeds we do. We also don’t accept to renounce the doership of the good things we do. We assume the doership of whatever good that’s happening, despite it being done by someone else. If someone asks, “Who did this?” People say, “I.” Everyone responds saying it’s they. If we committed some wrongdoing, and someone asks who did it… Everyone takes a step backward indicating it was someone else.\nAnjaneya (Hanuman) saw Mother Sita and returned. He crossed the ocean and entered Lanka. He fought with many. He relayed the message. He warned Ravana and then willingly let Ravana light his tail on fire. With his tail on fire, Hanuman proceeded to burn down all of Lanka. After putting out the fire [on his own tail], he traveled back the entire distance. He was the one who worked hard through all that. When the vanaras (monkey warriors) returned to Rama, everyone was taking credit for finding Sita. Everyone desires doership of a good activity. If someone does something wrong - like trying to find out who broke a glass vase… Everyone points fingers at others. No one agrees to take the responsibility.\nIn fact, you should not take the doership of a good deed or a bad deed. They are both a result of prakruthi (nature). Hence, leave the doership with it. In the beginning of chapter 3, God states this. At times, ahanka:ra (ego) blocks us from leaving the doership with prakruthi (nature). We think it is we who have done it. In such a case, why should we be leaving it with prakruthi (nature)? We feel we have done it. We want the result. That’s when danger arises. Whenever we assume doership of an activity, we end up reaping its results. We are fine to experience good results but we feel sad to experience bad ones.\nArjuna is involved in a war. He has the responsibility to suppress people who he is favorable with. He wanted to quit so as not to be at fault for attacking others. A normal person might think this way but Arjuna should not, as this is his job. Akin to a doctor performing surgeries, or a military officer in war… Arjuna came with the responsibility of either correcting or taking down the wrongful rulers. However, when faced with the situation, he backed away from the [responsibility] of war. He sat down and discarded his weapons. That’s when Sri Krishna took the responsibility of teaching him how and what he must do as his duty. To teach that duty, He discussed about two ways.\n[Arjuna] “I am the one waging war. I will be the one killing them. So, they will be suffering.” Who are you to think this way? Who should decide this? It’s the rulers or government that must decide whether there should be a war. If they ask you to do it, you must do it. “I [Sri Krishna] am the one governing this. I should decide if this should continue or if this should stop.” “Or all the elders here are the ones who came together and made the decision.” Post that, army formation took place. They have gathered 11 akshauhini army. Your side has gathered 7 akshauhini army. It was decided that the war must take place at a specific location. A specific time was decided. Everyone came and took their places. They blew the conches. They got their arrows ready to shoot. Now, you say you want to quit? Is this an appropriate thing to do? It’s not.\nCarrying out our responsibility may feel tough or undesirable at times, yet we must fulfill it. When performing your duty, leave the responsibility on the doer. Who has the responsibility? Dharmaraj or the other elders. Leave it on them. Don’t take that responsibility. You have come as a warrior. Play your role. This is what Arjuna must be told. Arjuna has the skill and capability to wage war but he lacks the right bhava (thought process). In one way, he fell victim to akruthsna-vith (half-knowledged) and athatthva-vith (ignorant of realities). He must be taught to become thatthva-vith (knower of truth) and kruthsna-vith (fully-knowledged). There is capability that’s required. Sri Krishna took up the high task of correcting the deficiencies in him. Through him, He is teaching the rest of the world as well on how to perform our responsibilities. What do we call this? He explained this earlier in chapter 3.\nloka sangraha (maintaining world order)\nlo:ka sangraham e:va:pi sampasyan karthum arhasi || lo:ka sangraham (You should perform your duty, also considering the maintenance of world order.)\nProperly shape the world that we are living in for our purpose. If there are already properly shaped people, take them. If there are those who are not, then shape them. Those who are in the process of being shaped, correct their faults. This is what a wise one must do. Sri Krishna is taking that responsibility and teaching Arjuna.\nBali Chakravarthi (Emperor Bali) is a wise one. He is a great philanthropist. Whatever anyone asks, he does not deny. However, he also has physical power along with that quality. Hence, he has the nature of suppressing the weak and dominating them. He snatched away Indra’s possessions in battle. He does good deeds. However, he shouldn’t be doing so by taking from someone else. There’s a saying - a man started donating his mother-in-law’s wealth. Why should you take away Indra’s portion? He shouldn’t, but he did. What should be done now? He has a quality of giving charity. However, he is following a wrong path. He must be brought into the right path. God molded Himself in accordance with his nature [of Bali Chakravarthi]. He is God Himself, the spouse of Mother Lakshmi [the source of all types of wealth]. He doesn’t need to seek anything from anyone. If necessary, He could punish someone and put them in the right path. However, there is a quality in him [Bali Chakravarthi] that makes him give anything anyone asks. So, He said He will become a yachaka (seeker). He approached and sought three feet of land. He measured all the three worlds with His feet. We hear this in the story of Bali Chakravarthi.\nThere is also someone named Janasruthi who is very rich. He would distribute food without denying anyone. However, he inculcated ahanka:ra (ego) while donating so much. Donating is a good deed but the feeling that he is the one doing it, known as aham bhavam (feeling of \"I am the doer\"), is wrong. Because the activity is a good one, we should let him do it. However, the manner in which it was done was at fault. So, it should be corrected. This is what God felt, which is why He made a wonderful attempt. He wanted to teach him a good lesson through Indra and Agni. He suggested they approach him disguising themselves as birds. The ‘birds’ flew above them. A good being has an aura, a circle of tejas (effulgence), around him. Janasruthi has the circle of tejas (effulgence) as well. And It created ripples. He slept on the terrace one night. The two ‘birds’ were flying and talking with each other. He knows the language of birds. The bird flying behind warns the lead bird, “Hey, Ballaksha! Don’t go there.” “There is an aura that will burn us. Let’s fly on the other side.” The bird flying in the front says, “Oh stop, is he a kind of Ryka or something??” And they both proceeded to fly directly above him.\nJanasruthi knew their language. He thought, “I am such a great donor. Who is this Ryka with more fame than I?” “How did he do that? What did he do to earn such fame?” “I made huge food donations and earned the top position!” He wanted to find out what Ryka did to earn such fame. He made an inquiry. It was later found that Ryka is someone with a skin disease, who lived outside of the village, trying to cure it himself. He went directly and asked him. Before that, he tried to invite him to his place. He (Ryka) denied. Janasruthi offered money. Ryka refused. He even offered half his kingdom. He was still denied. He inferred that whatever he has is more valuable than the kingdom. So, he set out to meet him. The more he refused things, the higher his curiosity grew. He even offered everything he had! Yet, Ryka refused. He [Janasruthi] was startled and began to cry out! As he cried out, his ahanka:ra (ego) melted. He learnt his lesson. That is when he was taught thatthva (truth). This is how the story goes.\nFood donation is a good cause. However, ahanka:ra (ego) is bad. The arrogant nature that “I am doing all of this” is wrong. We should not discourage the work that’s being done. However, we should not let them continue to do it in the same way. We should show the right path. We should steer them to the good way. Since he has half-knowledge on things, he should be taught full knowledge. This is what must be done. Devathas (demigods) like Indra and Agni came in disguise as birds to teach Janasruthi. God Himself incarnated as Vamana to teach Bali Chakravarthi. Arjuna reached a state of quitting the war due to many difficulties in keeping his responsibilities. At times, it might be difficult to do your responsibility. Sometimes, it can be a happy task. Waging war is a difficult task. War results in ‘loss’ of life on both sides. However, if a war is inevitable to establish the right processes, how can one quit while speaking of ethics? So, He is making an enormous effort to steer him towards the war. He didn’t ask him to quit the war. He didn’t ask him to stop being compassionate. However, when, where and how should each one be put into use? It is essential to teach this. That is why, He says in chapter 3…\n“Dear, you are an akruthnsavith (half-knowledged).”\nkruthsnavith na vichalayeth (a wise one does not let such a person quit work)\nSo, I will not agree for you to leave here without fighting in the war. At the same time, I will not agree for you to fight the war unregulated, killing anyone. You should know the proper way, but don’t take the doership on yourself. Even if you are victorious, don’t feel that you did it. If you lose, accept it. Don’t take the doership on yourself for this either. You are not the doer for either. You are only a person who must respond to a situation properly. That is it. As Krishna was teaching Arjuna how to fulfill his responsibility… He is also teaching us all how to lead our lives. He talked about leaving the doership in one of two ways. One is on the prakruthi (nature). He will also reveal the second way starting with sloka 3.30. Let us try to learn about that as well.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

He instructed five of his disciples to teach five subjects, one each, to Ramanujacharya. Ramanujacharya learned those five subjects from them. He shows acharya pratipatti (devotion to the teacher) towards Yamunacharya Swami. Yamunacharya Swami summarized each chapter of Bhagavad Gita in one verse. That composition is called Gitartha Sangraha (summary of Gita's meaning). In it, he established and presented the essence of each chapter. Later, Ramanujacharya wrote Gita Bhashya (commentary on the Gita) on the basis of it. He explained each of those verses in it. Then, he presented how all aspects of the chapter are reflected in their respective verses. He explained the summary of chapter 3 as…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nasakthya: lo:karaksha:yai gune:shwa:ro:pya karthrutha:\nsarve:sware:va nyasyo:ktha: thruthi:ye: karmaka:ratha: uktha:\nthruthi:ye: karmaka:ratha: uktha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn the third chapter, it is said that one should perform actions without attachment, for the protection of the world, attributing doership to the gunas (qualities of nature) or to the Supreme Lord.\n-----------------------------------------------\nChapter 3 explains about how to perform one’s karma (activities). God clearly explained this topic in chapter 3. How should one do his karma (actions)? Asaktya (without attachment). Leave the bhavana (feeling) that you are the doer of the karma (action). Leave the sanga (attachment) that it is because of you that the work is getting done. Leave the phalasaha (desire to experience the resulting benefit yourself). This is called sakti (attachment). When you give this away, it is called asaktya (without attachment).\nLokarakshayai (for the protection of the world). Because you are fully mature, you may not need to do some kinds of work. However, others might stop doing them because you are not. That shouldn’t happen. Hence, for the sake of others, you will have to do the work. This was explained earlier in chapter 3.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nlo:ka sangraham e:va:pi sampasyan karthum arhasi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou should perform actions for the welfare of the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nLokarakshayai (for the protection of the world). Asaktya lokarakshayai (without attachment, for the protection of the world). What should one do as they work in such a way? Kartrutha guneshvarepya sarvesvareva (attributing doership to the gunas or to the Supreme Lord). Guneshu (to the gunas). Leave the doership on gunas (qualities of nature), the sattva rajas and tamas (qualities of nature) formed in the body made of prakriti (material nature). Or… Sarvesvareva (to the Supreme Lord). Leave the doership on God, the indwelling supreme tattva (principle). The essence is to not keep doership on oneself. This is how one must perform karma (work). That is why, chapter 3 is called karma yoga (path of action).\nKarma yoga (path of action) is the way to perform karma (action) such that it becomes a means for a person’s upliftment. This chapter is thus called Karma Yoga (path of action). Yoga (means/path) is a means for achieving something. We have talked about this many times. The means must set the person free from current bondage and he should be uplifted. There are many types of means. Karma (action) is a means. Knowledge is a means. Devotion is a means. Also, many types of knowledge such as jnana vijnana (knowledge and wisdom). Another in the later chapters is daivasura sampat vibhaga (division of divine and demoniac qualities). Or shraddhatraya vibhaga (division of three kinds of faith)… Each of these are explained as a means. How does a person lead his life taking these as a means? This is what Bhagavad Gita teaches us. Chapter 3 explains how one can perform karma (action) as a means to be uplifted. He should not have any feeling of doership with the activities he does. He should do everything properly and responsibly. Because he does not need results, he should not do work incompletely or improperly.\nSanga (attachment). Because someone else is the doer, you should not work irresponsibly. While believing that you are not the doer, you should still do the work without any faults. Why? Lokarakshayai (for the protection of the world). This is what was explained through verse 3.29 of Bhagavad Gita.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nguna:gune:shu varthanthe: ithi mathva: na sajjathe:\nahanka:ra vimu:dda:thma:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who knows that the gunas (qualities of nature) act among the gunas (qualities of nature) does not become attached. One whose mind is deluded by ego (ahankara) thinks, \"I am the doer.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen one has ahankara (ego), he thinks that he is the doer. Arjuna listened to all this and had a question. “I am knowledgeable. I have intellect. Prakriti (material nature) does not have intellect.” Prakriti (material nature) is non-sentient. It is made of 24 tattvas (principles). None of them have knowledge by themselves. “Karmendriyas (organs of action), Jnanendriyas (organs of knowledge), Panchabhutas (five elements) and their vishayas (sense objects)…” None of these have knowledge. Prakriti (material nature) is made of all of these. “This body is a formation from prakriti (material nature).” “How can this regulate me?” “I am knowledgeable. My nature is knowledge.” “How can an inert being regulate conscious beings?” This is what Arjuna was wondering about. “Why should I bow down to it?” “I will suppress it myself.” “I will put it under control.” “I will ensure that I am not affected by prakriti (material nature).” This is Arjuna’s feeling.\nHowever, God says… This is another type of ahankara (ego). “I will suppress everything, I will put everything in control…” Prakriti (material nature) is jnana rahita (one without knowledge) but it is not karya shunya (devoid of action) like you think. How did this body get formed? It is formed as a result of past karma (actions). Karma (action) doesn’t work in your way. You will need to work as per its wish. You are not driving it. Karma (action) is driving you. You are sitting in a car. The car is made of a certain parameter set. When you are in the car, it will run based on its qualifications. All of a sudden, you may want to fly in the air while sitting in the car. That’s okay, but it won’t fly. You may say that an airplane goes very fast and thus it’s flying. Similarly, you may want to drive the car that fast to lift off. That will only cause an accident and damage. It is impossible to make it fly even if you drive it slow or fast. It will only move in its manner. It won’t move according to your wish. Karma (action) is the same way. Karma (action) is stocked inside and distributed throughout all areas of the body. It is on the body’s surface. It is in the senses. It is in the manas (mind). It is with the buddhi (intellect).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nindriya:ni mano:buddhihi asya adhistha:nam ucchathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe senses, mind, and intellect are said to be its abode.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe says this a little later. Jiva (individual soul) is dwelling inside all of these like a person sitting in the car. When someone is sitting in the car, he moves in the direction that the car is moving. If the car reverses, he is also moving backward. If it’s moving forward, he is too. Whilst the car is on the move, he cannot say he will move in the way that he wants. If he wants to do something different and tries to open the door to step out, he will fall and there’ll be consequences. So, he should stay in the car for as long as it's being driven. Similarly, whilst in this body, a person must behave in accordance with the mechanism of the body. It is the body that’s working. It’s not you. Put batteries in a torch and turn it on. Batteries are the cause but there is light because there is a torch. Similarly, it is the body that is the cause for our behavior. We should not forget this. Because the body is working, leave the responsibility on it. This is one method. This is what He explained. Guneshvaropya kartrutha (attributing doership to the gunas). Yamunacharya Swami says this in his verse. This is what Lord says in verses 3.27, 3.28, and 3.29.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nguna:gune:shu varthanthe: ithi mathva: na sajjathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who knows that the gunas (qualities of nature) act among the gunas (qualities of nature) does not become attached.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna didn’t seem to like this much. He thought… “I am very wise and knowledgeable. Prakriti (material nature) is an inert substance with no knowledge.” “How can I leave the doership on it, submit to it, and lead my life?” God… Firstly, respect what you see. Then, travel towards that which you cannot see. What you can see is prakriti (material nature). You can see the body, made of prakriti (material nature). You can see everything around and their nature. So, firstly leave it with what is visible. I am the one underlying both prakriti (material nature) and you. I am the one driving both. If you feel it’s insulting for you to leave the doership with prakriti (material nature), then leave it with Me. You know what I am and who I am, right? “Who is Krishna? What does He do? How does He do it?” They all experienced and understood that during their time of exile and disguise. Many great people also told them that you think that Krishna, who is with you, is your brother-in-law. However, He is not just that. He is the Sarvesvara (Lord of all), One who is the ruler of the entire universe. He is the Purushottama (Supreme Being) as explained by the Vedas (ancient scriptures). They all revealed that. So, Arjuna knows it. Because I am the indweller, don’t leave it with prakriti (material nature). Leave it with Me. Guneshvaropya sarvesvareva (attributing doership to the gunas or to the Supreme Lord). This is the summary of chapter 3. Until now, He explained how it [the doership] can be left with prakriti (material nature). From verse 3.30, Sri Krishna explains to Arjuna how to perform karma yoga (path of action) leaving the doership with God. Let’s also move ahead learning this.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

He is using Arjuna as a means to explain to all of us.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is it that binds a human being in prakruti (nature)? Generally, we say that it is karma (action), but why does karma (action) bind the human? When does karma (action) bind the human [to prakruti (nature)]? Why does it bind the human being? It binds because of the desire in humans to experience results. If he is doing some work, he expects to experience the result of it for himself. This desire for that result is what binds the person.\nIf a bank employee desires money from the bank for himself, that is criminal. As long as a sweet shop employee continues to sell sweets and fairly collect money, it’s fine. However, if he starts to eat those sweets himself… That is, if he develops the desire to experience the taste of the product… If that desire builds in him, he becomes guilty. We know this. It’s not wrong for one to be there, to sell, or work in a bank. But it is wrong to develop a desire for the results of that work. If he is an employee, he should perform the responsibility of an employee.\nWe have come to this prakruti (nature) to reduce a certain portion of karma (action). So, we should continue to work. Because we must work, we should - however, we should not expect the results for ourselves alone. We have alluded to this many times earlier. Yet, it’s not wrong to remind ourselves again. We are not working alone in this. It's teamwork. Body is working. Prakruti (nature) is working. Senses are working. Knowledge is working. God is working. Because all of these are in this together, work is happening here. All of these are coming together, and hence, work gets accomplished. However, out of ahankara (ego), human beings put everything aside. We generally think that only we should be benefited. Thus, incriminating ourselves. We have talked about this earlier. There are five causes. If only one takes credit, keeping aside the remaining four, it’s wrong.\nIf someone asks who did this work, we will have to say ‘I’. One of them has to respond and say it. The body, senses, knowledge, mind and all exist. However, only one is able to give the answer. That is jiva (individual soul). Karta (doer), the doer, is in fact him. There is no problem with being the doer. The problem comes with owning the doership. We must do our work properly! We should never quit working. We should never work erroneously. Because work is done by him [the jiva (individual soul)] and not by somewhere else. So, the doer is jiva (individual soul) - but he must renounce the doership. It’s a small difference - a very thin line! What is it? He must work. He is the one who must be doing it. Where should the ‘feeling of doing work’ be placed at? It should be placed at the work being done.\nIf the pen is the one writing, is the doership on the pen or on us? In one way, it can be with the pen. In another way, it can be with us. However, when you leave it with the pen, then you must leave results as well with the pen. Then, there is no problem - but we don’t feel like doing that. Once a check is signed, we use the money for us and not for it. Prakruti (nature) is doing the work. He [jiva (individual soul)] should be the doer but must leave the doership with it [Nature]. This is a slightly confusing topic for us. Why should he become the doer? All recommendations and restrictions come to the surface only for those with knowledge. “Do this. Don’t do this. Do it this way. Don’t do it this way.” Who is told all of these? Whoever can know it. Who is the one with knowledge? Only jiva (individual soul). Not prakruti (nature). So, whatever needs to be told must be told to jiva (individual soul). Therefore, he [jiva (individual soul)] should be the doer. Because he has the responsibility to practice the orders given. This is what the great Veda Vyasa says…\nkarta shastrarthavatvat (because the scriptures must be meaningful)\nBecause Shastra (scripture/divine instruction) must become meaningful… Shastra (scripture/divine instruction) is that which is God’s instruction. It is instructions such as “do this, don’t do this”. These are given for jiva (individual soul) only. Because they must become purposeful, the jiva (individual soul) must be the doer. He only should be the one working. He is the one who should know what’s being instructed. He should work too but the energy to do the work comes from a different source. So, he should leave the doership to that and he should do it without expecting a result. That is his responsibility.\nIn another way… We divide the doership into two parts. One who is the inspirer. The other who is the inspired doer. One is preraka karta (inspirer). The other is the prerya karta (inspired doer). Someone sitting here says ‘do this!’. He becomes the inspirer. The other one executes the work. He is called the inspired doer. One is the inspirer. The other is the inspired doer. Who is the inspirer for all of us? The inspiration for everything that is in the prakruti (nature), Nature, is the underlying ruler. We refer to that One with different names. Brahma, Ishwara, Parameshwara (names of God)! We refer to Him with different names. He is always the inspirer. What does he base the inspiration on? He bases it on his [jiva’s (individual soul’s)] karma (action) records. It is the jiva (individual soul) who listens and does. He does things based on what he hears. To do something, he needs a means. That tool is his body. The doer is the prakruti (nature). The one who gets inspired and accordingly runs it is the jiva (individual soul). One who inspires and runs him is Paramatma (Supreme Soul), God.\nManas (mind) must develop belief in this. Believing in this is extremely difficult, the ultimate challenge. To instill this belief in Arjuna, Sri Krishna had to reveal a scripture with seventeen [out of 18 total] chapters. It was then he said…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsthitho:smi gatha sande:haha\nkarishye: vachanam thava\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll my doubts are now cleared.\nI will now follow Your instructions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe could say that only then. However, Prahlad, the young one did not take that long. He had this belief firmly even at a young age. That is why he did not get distracted from his belief even when his father said many other things. He did not stop what he was supposed to be doing. When his father had the boy’s body attacked with knives, Prahlad believed that the indwelling One would take care of it. He did the same when he was thrown into the ocean. Also, the same when he was thrown into fire or crushed by elephants. Even when he was given poison. Whatever was done to him, he believed that the indwelling One is the inspirer. He [Prahlad] left the responsibility on Him [God]. He could stay without any difficulty. Meaning that he had that firm belief in his manas (mind).\nWhen someone has such a strong belief, we may think… He can quit doing all other work, and simply meditate, saying it’s all ‘Sri Hari…Sri Hari’. No. There is another one who runs as per His inspiration. This [jiva (individual soul)] is the prerya karta (inspired doer). Meaning, that we are the prerya karta (inspired doer). Meaning we all should work. You can’t quit saying, “It’s all Him. Why should I attend to anything?” In the way He is instructing you with the power, intellect, senses, and body that He has given, you must work. Prahlad did not compromise on this anywhere. His father instructed him to go to school. He did. “Be with the other children.” He was. “Do as the guru says.” He did. Prahlad didn’t say that he won’t care for any of this because it’s all Sri Hari! That is why he was with them. He learnt what the gurus taught him. When there was a necessity and a demanding situation, he said what he knew. When the guru was teaching, he never stopped listening to the guru. He was never inattentive or careless. In school, he was the top student. He was the wise one. The issue arose when his father asked him to say what he had learned. He said that the only right thought is the thought that is about Sri Hari. Those are eyes that see Him. Those are legs that walk for Him. Those are hands that worship Him. This is what he said. It was only when he came to his father that he said what he wanted to. When he was with the guru, he learned all that the guru taught exactly as he was told. He didn’t quit any activity. He respected his mother as a mother and behaved accordingly. He respected his father as a father and behaved accordingly. He respected his guru as a guru and behaved accordingly. With his friends, he conducted himself in the way one should. He did not show any shortfalls in the activities or behavior. He did not stop doing anything that he should be doing. He did not do any activities that he should not be doing. Meaning he never compromised in responsibilities. He didn’t place doership on himself, but he did all the work as per His instructions.\nDoership is of two types. We are becoming doers for Shastra (scripture/divine instruction) but the inspiration is He. Body is what acts and does work. So, don’t have the desire for the result with you. This is important for us. When you desire the result, that’s when you become bound. That is when karma (action) binds you. When karma (action) binds you, it becomes a ruchi (interest) or vasana (tendency). For experiencing those results, you will need to enter another body. This will go on and on and you enter a cycle. This is what God should stop for us. That is why, He says in verse 3.30…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nadhya:thma che:thasa: mayi sannyasya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEstablish clear knowledge about Me in the mind, and then place doership with Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSaying so, He takes Arjuna ahead. This is a firmness that must develop in the manas (mind). It’s not to be expressed in words or shown in action. Because in action, we have to live with those around and what we are with. We talked about the example of a car earlier. If it is meant to run at a specific speed and manner on roads, it should not try to travel on water or in air. We should keep everything where they should be and do the work that should be done. We should have faith. We should relinquish desire for the results. Saying so, Sri Krishna is trying to explain turning the doership towards Him, the One driving. Let’s try to learn.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nSri Krishna taught the complete Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, who listened as a wise man would. He asked for clarifications. God replied. In the end, [Arjuna] said he understood it very well. The war commenced. Arjuna sent [his son] Abhimanyu to disrupt the padmavyu:ha (strategic war formation). He did what he could as a young 16-year-old. But because of the deceptive strategy of all the evil-doers, he died. Despite having heard all of [Bhagavad Gita]... Unable to bear the news of Abhimanyu’s death, he said he would take his life and jump into the fire. He had heard Bhagavad Gita. In chapter 2…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvasa:msi ji:rna:ni yattha: viha:ya nava:ni gruhna:thi naro::para:ni |\nthattha: sari:ra:ni: viha:ya ji:rna:ni anya:ni samya:thi nava:ni de:hi: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nJust as a person casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so too the embodied soul casts off worn-out bodies and enters into new ones.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe heard all of these. He heard this, yet, he only heard it - that’s it. We hear, but do we retain everything we hear? Why should we spoil our brain with everything we hear? Similarly, that’s how Arjuna heard. We are taking Arjuna as an example to know how difficult it is to believe in what we hear. Despite hearing it directly from Sri Krishna… It only entered his brain to a certain level. He did not understand it fully.\nWhy can’t I control this prakruthi (material nature)? I should control this. Does it put me in its control? Should I leave the doership of activities on it? Arjuna had this question. We are in the process of discussing the answer for this. Despite knowing that prakruthi (material nature) is inert and without knowledge, we end up affected by it without our knowledge. That is why we are talking about this. God says in Alwar’s prabandha (divine composition) somewhere… “Prakruthi (material nature) is a wonderful net that I created.” “You are in this. It’s a mistake to think you can break free by yourself.”\nA pigeon builds a nest. There are some small pigeons, called bangaru pichukas (golden sparrows). They are very small in size but how well they build nests. They have only two legs, no hands and no other means. With only their beaks, we don’t know from where and what they collect, they make a beautiful nest. Can you unravel the nest without breaking any of the threads? We can also try doing it sometime. There’s a season when birds build nests. In nature, we see many trees with nests. Let alone building a nest, can we unravel it without breaking any of the threads? It’s impossible. A human being is so incapable that he cannot straighten out a nest built by a small bird! Prakruthi (material nature) is a wonderful nest built by the all-knowledgeable, omnipotent God. Is it possible to unravel that all by ourselves? It is impossible. It is His great rachana (creation).\nThat is why God acknowledged that he may be feeling it’s a shame to leave it upon prakruthi (material nature). “It’s okay to not leave it on prakruthi (material nature).” “I am the underlying One running you and prakruthi (material nature).” “You know My greatness. No one can conquer Me.” “I am referred to as ‘daivam’ (divine).” “One may win over prakruthi (material nature) if they try but it is impossible to win over Me.” “So, Arjuna! Place the responsibility and results of the work on Me.” “You carry on doing your activities happily as prescribed by sa:sthra (scriptures), as per your responsibility.” This is what He says in verse 3.30.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasy a:dhya:thma che:thasa: |\nnira:si:r nirmamo: bhu:thva: yudhyasva vigatha jvaraha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSurrendering all actions to Me, with your mind fixed on the Self, free from desire for results and possessiveness, fight without any anxiety.\n-----------------------------------------------\nnira:si:hi (put aside the desire for result). Because we desire results, we develop the feeling that we are the doer of work. Because we desire results, we want to be recognized as the cause for work being done. It will create mamatha buddhi (the feeling of ‘mine’). When there is no desire for results, the feeling of ‘mine’ subsides. nira:si:hi (no desire for results). That is why He stated that term first. nirmamo: bhu:thva: (become detached). Don’t quit the work though. You should do the work properly. Do it as prescribed but put aside the feeling that it is because of you that the work is being done. The minute you feel that the work is being done because of you, your mind will start to feel tense. “This is how it should happen. It should not happen this way.” “This is how far it should happen. This should not happen to this level.” “Why should this happen? Why should this not happen?” When do all these thoughts occur? Firstly, on desiring for the results. Secondly, on having the feeling that it is because of me. Consequently, on feeling insecure. That is called jvara (anxiety/fever). You should become one whom jvara (anxiety/fever) has left.\nWhat should you do? Firstly, don’t desire the results. “Then, who should that be with?” “Put it on Me.” “You know about Me. You know that I am all capable.” “You know that there is nothing for Me to gain from your actions.” “You know that I am the one who enables you to work and gives you what you have.” “You also know that there is nothing that can overtake Me.” “Leave it with Me.” “I will take the responsibility of crediting you with what you deserve.” “I will ensure there are no discounts applied, or commission deducted.”\nIf we give it to someone else for delivery, we should pay him for doing the job. We can’t be sure if it will reach the destination. Someone was starving for three days. The same person was asked to deliver some snacks. Very yummy snacks - crunchy and tasty. Two people were kept starving in a room for three days. They were given one box each for delivery with 50 large sized snacks in each box. The delivery destination was about 5 to 6 km away. What should they do? They were really hungry. The snacks in the box are very yummy and are releasing a tasteful fragrance. They didn’t know what to do. They somehow made it half-way through. They reached an old temple on the outskirts of the town. One told the other that he couldn’t walk and that they should do something [to satiate hunger]. They decided to cut down the weight of the snacks being carried. Both of them sat down to eat. They both finished exactly half of the quantity. They were taking 50 large ones. If they have eaten half, how many should be left? There should be 25. However, one delivered 50 of them. Another delivered only 25. “How did you deliver 50!?” asked the other. That is the magic. The snacks are large layered ones. He carefully peeled off each layer and ate until it was halved. The other person ate each one fully breaking it into pieces. Both ate half the quantity but the ‘wise’ one used only the top layers. He is intelligent. He knew how to do what. We should work but we should also know how not to mess up the result. “I am the one who knows how, when, and what format to give the results of your work to you.” “So, trust in Me.”\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasy a:dhya:thma che:thasa: (surrendering all actions to Me, with your mind fixed on the Self). adhya:thma che:thasa: (mind with spiritual knowledge). This is the important one. The mind. Not just the mind but that with knowledge of you, prakruthi (material nature), and Me, who is running prakruthi (material nature). Know it and develop a firm state. No need to leave responsibility on prakruthi (material nature). It’s inert and has no knowledge. Leave it with Me. I will take care of it. mayi sannyasya (surrender to Me). Why should you now worry about it? “How will I reach? How much can I accomplish? How will I do it?” When I am there to look after you, why should you be worried? nira:sihi nirmama (free from desire for results and possessiveness). Be this way and you won’t feel worried about anything. Now, keep working and go on. yudhyasva (do the work appropriately). He explained this to Arjuna. It is also our responsibility to recognise this key aspect, to be applied in the process of doing our activities. We should work properly and responsibly. However, we must recognize who we belong to, because of whom we are able to live. Accordingly, we must submit the results to Him. It’s not right to desire those results. Swami is explaining this very nicely. mayi (Me). He is referring to Himself. Let’s move forward, learning what He is.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

We can’t see it with the naked eye. Hence, we say invisible. We can never recognize daiva (divine power) with the sense organs.\nThere is a beautiful incident in Srimad Ramayanam (the epic Ramayana). Rama was exiled from the kingdom instead of being coronated. Everyone was sad except for the mother, Kaikeyi. Mother Kausalya was sad. Brother Lakshmana was sad. Rama was taking acceptance from each to leave for the forest. He approached his mother. She was in extreme sadness. She kept feeling sad about the situation. She felt bad hearing this instead of the long-awaited coronation of her son. Mother was feeling extremely sad.\nFrom the outset, Lakshmana Swami (Lord Lakshmana) observed the entire sequence of events. He was there when Rama was fasting the previous day in the temple. He was there when Rama came back from there. He was watching when Rama went to Dasaratha. He also watched the way mother Kaikeyi created the entire plot. He was getting very angry and sad. However, since his brother was there and engaging through it, he should not talk in between. So, he was forcibly holding his anger down and sitting there.\nRama concluded his activity there and approached his mother to ask for leave. His mother wanted to sit him down and feed him sweets and all other dishes. He said, “Mother, this is not the time for eating these. I must go to the forests.” She wept aloud and felt so sorry. The minute mother cried, Lakshmana Swami (Lord Lakshmana) found support. He then began to display all his emotions.\n“Brother, this is all a drama led by Bharatha from behind the scenes. I will take care of him. Let’s see who will stop me. Why care about the old man’s word, the aged one, more than 60,000 years old?! Above 60,000 years, his mind is not in his control. What will you achieve, taking his word? Look at all the people. They are keen for you. What will you gain by hurting them all? Take the simhasan (throne). We’ll see who will come to stop it. Why do you think I have these shoulders? It doesn’t matter if it’s Bharatha or anyone else! Why do you think I have this dagger and all these arrows? They are all here with me to serve You. I will see who stops You. Please take the simhasan (throne),” he said.\nRama heard all this. “Dear! This is all planned by God. It is not planned by you or me. It is not by the king or anyone else. You know how the situation was the previous night. We were in the temple, fasting. Something was planned and something else happened. In such a case, who do you think other than daiva (divine power) caused this situation? We can’t do anything against daiva (divine power),” said Rama!\nLakshmana Swami (Lord Lakshmana) was furious hearing this. “Why are you saying daiva (divine power), daiva (divine power), daiva (divine power)?! I will drive that daiva (divine power) away with my power and effect. With my purushartha (human effort), I will drive that daiva (divine power) away. You take the throne.” Rama laughed.\nDid daiva (divine power) become visible to you and ask you to go into the forests? God will never do things directly in front of you. After things are done, you will think of God! We realize God after looking at the result but daivam (divine power) never shows up in front of us. Such a silly person you are!\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkaschith daive:na sowmithre: yo:ddhum uthsahathe: puma:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nO Saumitra (Lakshmana), what wise person would dare to fight with destiny (divine power)?\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere is your shadow that comes with you. You get angry at it. You raise a knife to kill it. What do you call such a person wanting to split his shadow into pieces? Don’t we call him a crazy person? Like the way you can’t do anything to a shadow, it’s the same with God. He’s not something that’s visible to the eye, He’s something that drives you from behind the scenes.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyasya na grahanam kinchith karmano: nyathr drusyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhose (divine power's) grasp is not seen in any action, nor can it be directly perceived.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe’s not something one can get hold of. Just as one cannot get hold of smoke or shadow, getting hold of daiva (divine power) is impossible. It cannot be seen. “So, don’t speak as you wish, out of rage.”\nFollowing God’s wish, you should use pourusham (manly effort) or purushartha (human effort). Your efforts are important. “Many people say that daiva (divine power) is there, but one’s efforts also should be there. Both should be there.” No. Your efforts are 0. It’s the daiva (divine power) that works. The work that daiva (divine power) is making you do happens because it is not stopping you from putting in the effort. You should know this. It is because of daiva (divine power) that the entire work happens. It’s not that you are both, together co-running the engine, splitting work. Nothing! There is nothing we are running. He is the One running everything. He is the One running our intellect, our senses, our body, the world around us - everything. What we need to do is to recognize it. Recognize it and use our knowledge to live in accordance with it. We cannot do anything to It.\nWhatever your effort is, it’s happening because of His grace and with the energy He has given. If you think that it is happening because of you, thereby adding ahankara (ego) to it, it will further degrade you. You must have belief that everything is happening because of Him. You must work thinking that it is because of Him you are able to do any work. That knowledge, the work done with such knowledge is called pourusham (manly effort).\npurusha prayatna (human effort)\nWe should do our work with God’s grace, but we should not think of going against Him. If one does that, one will be called crazy. There is nothing that you did, nor I, nor Mother Kausalya, nor Mother Kaikeyi. Sri Rama recognized this. Mother Kaikeyi also did not know.\n14 years after Ravana’s death, all the devatas (celestial beings) came to praise Sri Rama. Dasaratha also joined them as a devata (celestial being). He expresses that he now understands why Kaikeyi behaved so adamantly and foolishly. She did not care for anyone’s advice or scoldings. “I did not understand why she stood on her word so firmly. I also have admonished her quite a lot. Now I understand the reason. Now I understand it’s because of daiva (divine power). It’s the work of all the devatas (celestial beings).” He said so.\nWho is watching It? Who can get hold of It? Who can control It? God is not something that bows down to the control of anyone. Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha could not do anything to It. Kamsa and Ravanasura could not do anything to It. All of them tried. We hear the story of Ravana. He went around all the lokas (worlds/universes) to get hold of daiva (divine power). He wanted to crush It. However, It did not come into his control. It was behind him. It was running him but he lacked that sense. Daiva (divine power) is very powerful. We refer to it as the lalata rekha (lines on the forehead, representing our fate) that drive us. This is what It does.\nDon’t think of some temporary entity as daiva (divine power) - rather recognize Me as daiva (divine power). Sri Krishna is explaining this to Arjuna in verse 3.30.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasy a:dhya:thma che:thasa: |\nnira:si:r nirmamo: bhu:thva: yudhyasva vigatha jvaraha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSurrendering all actions to Me, with your mind fixed on the Self, free from desire and possessiveness, fight without any mental agitation.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is His name? You know who I am. Who is the One preaching Bhagavad Gita? It is Sri Krishna. However, He is not referred to by that name. Wherever He was mentioned, He was referred to as ‘Sri Bhagavan uvacha (The Blessed Lord said)’. He is Bhagavan (God).\nIn chapter 15…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\natho::smi lo:ke: ve:de: cha pratthithah purusho:ththamaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, I am renowned in the world and in the Vedas as Purushottama (the Supreme Person).\n-----------------------------------------------\n“I am called Purushottama (Supreme Person),” He said. I am the One who is Bhagavan (God), having six divine supreme qualities and with no faults. I am the One who is Purushottama (Supreme Person), the supreme among all. I dwell in every being.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nahama:thma guda:ke:sa sarvabhu:tha a:sayasthithaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nO Gudakesha (Arjuna), I am the Self seated in the hearts of all beings.\n-----------------------------------------------\nI dwell in all beings and govern them. So, leave the responsibility with Me. I will drive you and things around you in the appropriate way. This is what Bhagavan (God) said.\nWho is Bhagavan (God)? One who has 6 qualities fully and One who is without any faults.\nbha ga va an\nBhagavan (God)\nGreat sages like Parasara explained the meaning of the word. It means One who is shadgunya purna (full of six divine qualities). It means One who is heya guna dura (devoid of all undesirable qualities), without a chance of any faults. Meaning He is One who has great qualities such that He cannot be found with any fault. He is sakala kalyana gunakara (abode of all auspicious qualities), and heya guna pratibhata (opponent of all undesirable qualities). These are the ways He is described.\nWe will move ahead knowing who that Bhagavan (God) is.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIn chapter 3, God explains how He runs us from ‘behind the scenes’ as we do any kind of work. If we recognize this and perform the ordained duties faithfully, life will move forward without disturbances.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights all worlds.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBhagavad Gita has instances where many people spoke out. It starts off with the first verse being Dhritarashtra’s words. Then, it continues with Sanjaya’s words. Then, we hear Arjuna’s words. We see Sri Krishna’s upadesas (teachings). Whenever someone speaks, it is indicated by the word uva:cha (speaks). Dhritarashtra uva:cha (Dhritarashtra spoke), Sanjaya uva:cha (Sanjaya spoke), Arjuna uva:cha (Arjuna spoke) - which means that person spoke those words. When Sri Krishna spoke, it should be Sri Krishna uva:cha (Sri Krishna spoke). But that’s not how it’s said. What does it say? They say… They say, Sri Bhagavan uva:cha (Sri Bhagavan spoke). Sages have always referred to Sri Krishna as ‘Bhagavan’ everywhere.\nWhat does Bhagavan (Lord) mean? It means One who has 6 qualities in full. The three - bha, ga, va, - and an at the end. As per grammar, when ‘an’ comes at the end, it becomes reversed called na.\nBha\nGa\nVa\nEach has 2 qualities, totaling 6. Na meaning One who does not have anything else. What does He have? What does He not have?\nBha means jnana (knowledge) and shakti (power).\nGa means bala (strength) and aishwarya (control).\nVa means virya (steadfastness) and tejas (radiance).\njnana shakti bala aishwarya virya tejas (knowledge, power, strength, control, steadfastness, radiance). One who has these 6 qualities in abundance. What are they?\nJnana (knowledge) is the ability of knowing everything simultaneously.\nyo: ve:tthi yugapath sarvam (one who can know everything at the same instant). No other beings have this quality. We learn many things, but that knowledge is in sequence one after another. How fast one knows things one after another is a different topic. It may be that one knows a million topics in one second. It may be that one knows a trillion things in one second. However, we will know them only sequentially. We can’t know everything at the same time. If there are 16 cameras, then a large single screen shows all the 16 in different windows. However, our brain will not be able to spotlight all the topics at once like that. All the topics can be in the spotlight one after another at a very rapid speed. In our computers, many things run in one millisecond. All of them also run in an orderly manner, not at random. However, [Lord] sees everything at the same instant like everything on a single screen. What, how, where, and when of all jivas (living beings) in the world is perceived by Him at the same time. That is called jnana (knowledge). In reality, whatever we have, is not to be called jnana (knowledge). Jnana (knowledge) is that of His [Bhagavan’s]. We must know how to differentiate between the two jnanas (knowledges). So, we call ours, samanya jnana (general knowledge). His is called sarvajnathva (omniscience). That’s the little difference.\nThe second one is shakti (power). His shakti (power) is that which makes Him sustain the entire existence. While sustaining it, He has the ability to do what and how He thinks. We think of many things. We think of landing on the moon or the Sun. We think of landing on Saturn. We can’t achieve these as we think of them. It’s not that way for Him. He has the ability to actualize whatever He thinks. It is named shakti (power). We also have some shaktis (powers). We can pick up a pen. We can hold it. We can put it back. We can stretch the hand back and forth. We should be able to differentiate between our shakti (power) and His. Hence, our shakti (power) is called samanya shakti (general power) and His is called sarva shakti (all-encompassing power). So, jnana (knowledge) and shakti (power).\nBala (strength) is that prowess which makes Him hold everything. He showed this as Krishna. As a five-year-old, He held the big Govardhana Mountain on a single finger for 7 days! He did that to show us [His bala (strength)]. He holds all the lokas (worlds) in the same way. He holds the earth, sky, everything. This is His bala (strength). There is a difference between our bala (strength) and His bala (strength).\nNext… Aishwarya (control) is that ability which makes Him regulate and run everything including the souls. He can run all the non-sentient beings in the way He wants. We don’t have that ability. He has the ability to compress this macro universe into a micro form and place it in His stomach. He has the ability to preserve what’s inside, without getting digested and mixed up with anything else. He also has the ability to retrieve everything properly. It is His unique skill of keeping everything in His control. This skill of keeping in control is called isatha (control). Isatha (control) is also called aishwarya (control). Generally, we think aishwarya (control) is money. No. It is the controlling ability.\nWhat is next? Jnana (knowledge), shakti (power), bala (strength), aishwarya (control), virya (steadfastness), and tejas (radiance). After holding something for some time, we get tired. Even if it is a small object, we may be able to hold it for some time. But after some time, gradually you will end up putting it down. You may try to hold it in another position but you will still end up putting it down. We may feel that it is not heavy but after some time, it will show its effect. Then, it will take us in its control. If we hold it very firmly, our body will begin to sweat and tremble. If at all we are forced to do so, that’s what happens. However, He has the ability to hold all of these without shaking even a bit. He does not change. We also don’t change for some time while holding it. After a while, we end up shaking. He does not change like that. This is called virya (steadfastness).\nTejas (radiance). It is that ability which makes Him overpower anything with His radiance. He can bring everything into His control with His radiance. Hence, He has tejas (radiance). In general terms, we call it parakrama (prowess). A lion has parakrama (prowess). Meaning even when it is somewhere far, we have a mood of fear. What it has is called parakrama (prowess). It has it whether it is awake or sleeping. If the lion is taking a nap, do we feel like we can go and pet it by rubbing its skin? Can anyone go near it? Just looking at it, we feel a sense of wow because of its tejas (radiance). This is the other ability of His.\nJnana (knowledge), shakti (power), bala (strength), aishwarya (control), virya (steadfastness), and tejas (radiance). One who has these qualities without any faults, barriers or limitable magnitude. One with illimitable magnitude. One who has all these six in abundance.\nNa\nOne who does not have anything else, any faults.\nkalyana guna purna (full of auspicious qualities), durguna purna (devoid of bad qualities). One who has all auspicious qualities in full and One who has no bad qualities. He is called Bhagavan (Lord). This holds true only with Narayana. This name holds right only for Vishnu. Narayana, Vishnu, Vasudeva are all His names. It applies only to Him. We may say that we call many others with these names. We can. Whenever there is a tiny bit of His qualities in anyone, people use the name. Valmiki Bhagavan, Parasara Bhagavan, Vyasa Bhagavan. If we are using this name for anyone… Shastra (scriptures) says… tad guna lesa yogat aupacharikaha (as a service, because they have a little of His qualities, they are called with the same name). It is not a name that will fit them fully. It fits only Him without any limitation. This is the declaration of Shastra (scriptures). This is properly explained in Bhagavata and other scriptures.\n“Arjuna! I am the One with all those [qualities].”\n“Even though you are waging war today, don’t think that it is happening because of you.”\n“Realize that I am the underlying One driving it.”\n“Leave it with Me and I will take care of it.”\n“If you take responsibility, you will end up with the burden of all the good and bad of it.”\n“If you leave it with Me. I will take care of it.”\n“I will make them suitable for you and the rest of the beings.”\n“I will ensure the appropriate results are given.”\nmayi sarvani karmani sannyasya (surrendering all actions to Me). To leave [results] with Him doesn’t mean you ask Him to do everything and sit idle. adhyatma chetasa (with a mind fixed on the Self). With firm belief in the minds that have been properly qualified, leave the responsibility on Me and… Perform ordained activities happily. Speaking about His effect in verse 3.30, Sri Krishna explains the way to perform one’s responsibilities. “If not on prakriti (nature), leave it on Me.” Saying so, God shows Himself here. Learning about how He depicts further about Himself, let’s move ahead.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "episode": 80,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nChapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita is called Karma Yoga. It is about knowing the right process of doing your work. There are two aspects to knowledge when performing your work. One is how to go about it at the physical level. The second is how to think of it in your mind. There is no compromise at the physical level. You must do your work properly as per your responsibilities. The important aspect is to know how to approach it mentally. In chapter 3, God explains how to think of it. Firstly, He explains its formation. He explains in how many ways prakruthi (nature) is formed. It is cooperating with you. You should cooperate with it. Both of you live together. He said so. Because it is cooperating with you and nurturing you in many ways, leave the doership with it. Arjuna felt that it was insulting for him [to leave the doership with prakruthi (nature)]. “Leaving responsibility on prakruthi (nature) which is non-sentient and not useful?!” “When I am the one working, I will run the prakruthi (nature) the way I want to.” At face value, his expression might have meant that. “Okay, then don’t leave it on prakruthi (nature). Leave it to Me who is the underlying One.” He said so in verse 3.30. When He asked him to leave the responsibility to Him, He had to explain who He is. He [Sri Krishna] is in front of him [Arjuna] driving the chariot, holding the reins of the horses. He [Arjuna] should not think that ‘Leaving to Him’ equals trying to cross a river holding a dog’s tail. He should not think that ‘Leaving to Him’ may pull him down. So, He should tell Arjuna who He is. Bhagavan (God) is explaining that.\nmayi sarvani karmani sannyasya (While performing all the responsibilities ordained to you, leave the responsibility on Me, recognizing that I am the underlying cause.) With what would you do this? adhyatma chetasa (with a mind fixed on the soul). Having established knowledge of atma (soul) in your mind. With that firm knowledge, leave the responsibility on Me. Firstly, He is asking you to qualify your manas (mind). Manas (Mind) should be qualified with the knowledge of atma (soul). We should first know that atma (soul) is different from prakruthi (nature). Paramatma (God) is the One who runs atma (soul). Paramatma (God) also runs prakruthi (Nature and its formation, the body). Because sentient and non-sentient entities are run by Him… If responsibility is left on Him, it will be comfortable for you. Establish this first mentally and then, carry on with your responsibilities accordingly. If you really know this, the phalasaha (desire for results) for yourself, decreases. When that decreases, the mamatha ahankara (feeling that all this is happening because of you) decreases. When that decreases, the manasa jvara (mental turmoil) decreases.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnira:si:r nirmamo: bhu:thva:\nyudhyasva vigatha jvaraha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBeing free from desire and possessiveness, fight, free from mental distress.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen He shows Himself, He does this in two viewpoints. While you are seeing My accessibility as a charioteer, My real nature is Purushottamathva (the state of being the Supreme Person). We learned earlier that He is ‘Bhagavan’ (God). One who does not have any doshas (faults), and One who is akara (repository) of all divine qualities. Akara (Repository) means repository. He is the repository of all good qualities. sadgunakara (repository of good qualities), durguna dura (far from bad qualities). Such a one is called Bhagavan (God). He is Purushottama (Supreme Person). In chapter 15, He clarified this. He said “I am Purushottama (Supreme Person)”. What does it mean by He is Purushottama (Supreme Person)? utthama purusha (Supreme Person). In chapter 15, He says… uttama purushasthu anyaha (But the Supreme Person is different). What is He anya (different) from? He is different from kshara (destroyable), and akshara (undestroyable).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyasma:th ksharamathi:tho:ham akshara:dapicha utthamaha\natho:smi lo:ke: ve:de:cha prathithaha purusho:tthamaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBecause I am beyond the perishable and even superior to the imperishable, therefore, I am celebrated in the world and in the Vedas as Purushottama (the Supreme Person).\n-----------------------------------------------\nI am different from kshara (perishable) and akshara (imperishable). What is kshara (perishable)? ksharam pradha:nam amrutha:ksharam hara:ha (Kshara is the primary matter, Akshara is the immortal soul, Hara is the one who uses it). Ksharam (Perishable) is all the prakruthi (nature) that is visible to the naked eye. That which has a form that goes through change. Meaning its form continuously changes. Small or big, everything in this prakruthi (nature) continually changes. We can’t notice the change in the mountains but they also change. Their change is over a longer timeline. Some changes are seen in a shorter time frame such as leaf formation post sowing a seed. You pluck a fruit and you will see a change in color, taste, etc. If you pluck a flower, it starts to wither. Its form, color, and fragrance change. There is a change that occurs in a short time. Some changes over a long time. Others change over a still longer time frame, but change is inevitable in everything that is visible. So, these, including our bodies are ‘kshara’ (perishable). Bodies also change. We were this much then. We are this much now. We go back to being this much again. Not just us, everyone all the way to Chathurmukha Bramha (four-faced Brahma) undergoes changes. There is nothing in prakruthi (nature) that is beyond change. So, they are called kshara (perishable). The second one is akshara (imperishable). Akshara (Imperishable) is the jiva (individual soul) who is the base of the indwelling jnana (knowledge). He [akshara (imperishable), soul] is amrutha (immortal), one with no death. He is hara (one who uses), one who uses prakruthi (nature) in accordance with one’s karma (actions). He uses jnana (knowledge) for that purpose, experiencing prakruthi (nature), thereby reducing his karma (actions). That’s why he is called hara (one who uses). amurtaksharam haraha (the immortal imperishable is the user). ksharatmana visathe deva ekaha (The one God enters the perishable soul). One who runs these both is the One who is different from both. kshara (perishable) is named purusha (dweller in the body). There are jivas (individual souls) in these clearly. We realize that in some of them because movements in them are clearly visible. We move and so we are named jiva (individual soul). Birds move. Animals move. Trees grow. Worms move. Insects come. We see some of them move. All their bodies undergo change. So, they are called kshara (perishable). The cause for change is the indwelling jiva (individual soul). They are called purusha (dweller in the body). Jiva (Individual soul) made the body a pura (city/dwelling), and dwells in it. Hence, purusha (dweller in the body). The bodily form being female or male is not a factor here. This body is called pura (city/dwelling). One who is sha (dwelling) in it is called purusha (dweller in the body). A jiva (individual soul), soul, with a deha (body) is called purusha (dweller in the body). All these have bodies that change and hence they are called kshara purushas (perishable dwellers). All of us are called kshara purushas (perishable dwellers). Everything we see in nature is called kshara purusha (perishable dweller). The second one… When a soul has exhausted its karmic stock and crosses over… It gets a different type of body that is not built by karma (actions). That body does not change by karma (actions). It is beyond the reach of karma (actions). So, it is called akshara (imperishable). Here, this is called kshara purusha (perishable dweller). There he gets a body that does not get destroyed - a body known as ‘akshara sarira’ (imperishable body). There is jiva (individual soul) dwelling in it as well. He is called akshara purusha (imperishable dweller). kshara purusha (souls with karma-based bodies) and akshara purusha (souls with divine bodies). Who are You then? I am beyond these two. yasma:th ksharamathi:tho:ham akshara:dapi cha utthamaha (Because I am beyond the perishable and even superior to the imperishable). I am One above akshara (imperishable) as well. That is why My name is Purushottama (Supreme Person). Talking about purusha (dweller in the body)… We are all uttha purushas (ordinary persons). As we are living because we have to live, eating because we have to eat, etc. We are working because we have to, listening because we have to. We are roaming around because we have to, watching because we have to. We are living because we have to live. So, we are uttha purushas (ordinary persons). However, some live to practice jnana (knowledge). They are slightly better and they are named uth purushas (elevated persons). People say, punya purushas (virtuous persons) are those who are among purushas (persons) but different. They are called uth purushas (elevated persons). Some of the uth purushas (elevated persons) exhaust karma (actions) and are released from karmic bondage. They reach the place they need to and they are called utthara purushas (liberated persons). They are those purushas (persons) who have reached destiny. They are called utthara purushas (liberated persons). Uth (elevated) and utthara purushas (liberated persons). He who runs both of them is only One. He is called utthama purusha (Supreme Person) - Purushottama (Supreme Person). Annamaacharya sings… kadagantimayya mimmu purusho:tthama (Please see me, Purushottama). He is the One Purushottama (Supreme Person). He is Bhagavan (God). He is Purushottama (Supreme Person). What does It mean? One who runs everyone as per His will - regardless if they are chetana (sentient), or achetana (non-sentient). He is the One who can control them based on their qualifications. Vedas specify how and from where He controls them. anthahpravishta sastha jananagum sarvatma (He enters within, the ruler of people, the soul of all). He dwells in every object including the sentient. We may question, “If He enters the sentient, won’t they die?” When it says ‘enters the sentient’, it means that He enters in a way that He can control it. It does not mean He makes a hole and enters through it. Being there… sastha jananam sarvatma (the ruler of people, the soul of all). Dwelling in it, He runs it. The reason for entering there is to run it. That is why, He is named antaryami (inner controller). anthaha (enters) + yami (controls). To do this, He runs both. Veda (Vedic scripture) says this not at one instance, but in many instances. ya atmani thistan (who dwells in the soul), atmanamantaraha (within the soul), yamatmana veda (whom the soul does not know), yasyatma sariram (whose body is the soul), ya atmanamantharo yamayathi (who controls the soul from within), satamatma antaryamyamruthaha (He is your inner controller, the immortal soul). Bruhadaranyaka (Upanishad) explains. Starting with matti (earth), to all the dhatus (elements)… To all the bhuthas (beings), all the way to atma (souls)… ya atmani thistan (who dwells in the soul too). ya atmanantharo yamayathi (who dwells within and controls). Because He dwells within, the indwelling One is atma (soul) and the external entity is called sarira (body). He controls, being the antaratma (inner soul). Veda (Vedic scripture) says this not in one instance, but many instances. He, Himself, states as well. sarvasya chaham hrudi sannivishtaha (I am seated in the hearts of all). I dwell inside and am the controller. I am the reason for all the knowledge, wisdom, memory loss, etc. In chapter 15, He says so. “That is Me. So, leave the responsibility on Me.” “I will see that the results of the karma (actions) you do come to you in the way and the measure they should.” “I will see that your life goes on smoothly.” Swami is taking Arjuna forward telling him how he should mentally think while doing one’s work. Let us also move along. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nTruths of life, aspects of eternal realities, and also Vedic secrets. God explains all these in Bhagavad Gita in a comprehensible manner. This prapancham (world) is a combination of three thatthvas (realities): Prakruthi (nature), ji:va (souls), and parama:thma (God). Nature can be seen. Souls and God cannot be seen. Meaning, they cannot be seen with our naked senses. Senses are available as a means, but they are also made of nature. Because they are made of nature, they can only recognize things that are made of nature. They do not have the sakthi (power) to perceive that which is beyond Nature: Souls and God. They are both different thatthvas (realities). Because they are different thatthvas (realities), how can they [senses] identify them? How can eyes, made of nature, have darshan (vision) of that thatthva (reality)? Hence, thatthva (reality) cannot be identified by them.\nThen, how do we recognize It? That is why, we depend on sa:sthra (Vedic scriptures). We believe as per sa:sthra (Vedic scriptures) that there is an indwelling ji:va (soul). A ji:va (soul) exists in every moving object. However, there is an order for all of these. This order is functioning because Someone is running it. So, One that runs the order of everything properly is called… Parama:thma thatthva (the reality of God), Bhagavath thatthva (the reality of the Lord). That which runs is called I:shwara thatthva (the reality of the Controller). The same thatthva (reality) is called Purusho:tthama (the Supreme Person) in chapter 15. Also called I:swara (the Controller). He says so in chapter 15:\n`bibharthi avyayaha i:swaraha lo:kathrayam a:visya` (I pervade all the kshara (karma driven destroyable) and akshara (divine driven undestroyable) thatthvas (realities), and I bibharthi (hold) them. I:swara (the Controller) governs them avyaya (without being affected) while they change).\nHe explains these three qualities. He explains in chapter 15 that He is Purusho:tthama (the Supreme Person), the One with these three qualities. In chapter 15, He also explains I:swara (the Controller). Bhagavan (Lord) is of such nature. We should now understand that He is indwelling within us. If we know that, how can we say that we are the cause for all that we are doing when He in fact is the One [controlling]? If we know that fact – !\nWhen in flight, the pilot, engine, oil, mechanism, and computer are all doing their part. While in flight, if we claim that the flight is taking off into the sky because of me… Everyone will laugh at us. They will think of keeping an eye on us. They would say that you are a crazy person. It is not running because of us. There is One who is running it. Yes, we are traveling in it. We are the ‘doers’ of the travel. However, we are dependent. There is nothing in our hands. Bramhasu:thram (Brahma Sutras) says that it is para:th (in the hands of the Other). This life is the same way. We are traveling in a flight called the human body. We are the ones traveling but its route is not in our hands. There is One who is running it. There is one that is running. There are clouds in between. There are things, known as turbulence, that come on the path. The flight goes through it, down, jumps back up, and moves forward. All of this is taken care of by the pilot. All we should do is leave the responsibility on him. Watch anything we want or eat or sleep or walk on the aisle. That’s the work we can do while we are there. There is One who is running it. There is one that is running. You are the traveler in it. If we remember this in life, that’s enough. The human body flight is running because of a pilot named God.\n`mayi` (on Me)\n“I am the One running it. Leave the responsibility on Me.” Sleep peacefully. Do all your other work. Keep doing the ordained work while you are in this body. Don’t worry about anything such as if there is cloud or heat or snow or cool air. Why do you worry about all those kinds of things? Sometimes, temperatures might reach -70 or -80 degrees. But still you are okay. When you are sitting inside, what’s the problem for you? Sometimes, it will cross over some snowy mountains. Sometimes over desert. Sometimes over thick forests. But still, you are okay. As long as you trust the pilot and do your work, you will reach your intended destination. Similarly, keep doing your activities properly for as long as you are in this human body. Leave the responsibility on Me.\n`mayi sarva:ni karma:ni` (all actions on Me)\nHowever, you should do whatever is prescribed, not as per your wish. If you want ‘fresh’ air from outside and poke a hole in the plane window… You will be in trouble. There are certain prescribed activities. Sit in this manner. While taking off, sit this way. While touching down, be seated this way. When the flight is in cruise, this is how you can be. The attendants show some movements for the legs. They also advise you to move around. Follow those. They advise you to drink plenty of fluids. If you can, do it. If you think you are fine, then don’t. However, if you think of some ‘creative’ ideas, it will be dangerous to you and the fellow passengers. There are some dos and don’ts. Follow the dos and be free. How will I go? How will this flight take off? What if something happens to it? Why do you have to think about all those kinds of things? How is that useful to you? Be free. Don’t think about how you will reach the destination. Don’t think about how it is being driven. Don’t worry.\n`vigatha jvaraha` (become free from anxiety)\n`nirmama` (become free of attachment with it)\n`nira:si:hi bhu:hu` (become free of the results)\nYou will reach. You will reach the destination you are supposed to. You will reach home properly. Fine. In verse 3.30, that’s what Swami says.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasya\nadhya:thma che:thasa: |\nnira:si:r nirmamo: bhu:thva:\nyudhyasva vigatha jvaraha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nRelinquishing all actions to Me, with a mind fixed on the Self, free from desire, free from possessiveness, and free from anxiety, fight!\n-----------------------------------------------\n`sannyasya` (leave the responsibility on Me)\nWe don’t know who the pilot is. We don’t even know what responsibility to leave on Him. He is asking for it?! We are leaving on Him?! We believe in our mind in the case [of the flight]. `adhya:thma che:thas` (with a spiritual mind). We believe that he is the right pilot and the right flight, A380. So, relinquish properly and reach properly. But, who knows? Sometimes, it may not land well. Anything can happen but we have belief in the mind. That will make us sit happily in it. We travel. In fact, we may have some doubts there but not in the journey of human life.\n“I run crores and crores of living beings.” `mayi` (on Me). That is why He is called Purusho:tthama (Supreme Person). That is why He is Bhagavan (Lord). That is why He is Sarve:swara (Lord of all). That is why He is Sarva:tharya:mi (Inner Controller of all).\n`thami:swara:na:m paramam mahe:swaram tham daivatha:nam paramamcha daivatham` (He is the supreme great Lord of all lords, the supreme God of all gods). Swe:tha:swatharam Upanishad establishes thus. He is the One who navigates all the navigators. He is the One who gives radiance to all those who radiate. Whichever de:vatha (deity) one may worship, the prayers reach Him. Whatever a de:vatha (deity) graces someone with, it is being given by Him through him. Whatever one may think they are giving, the sakthi (power) to give it comes from the underlying He. Upanishad says this. He is the One governing everything.\n`pathim viswasya a:thme: svaragum sa:svathagum sivamachyutham` (the Lord of the universe, the self-luminous, eternal, auspicious, and unfailing One). He will always wish for subham (auspiciousness) for everyone. He is achyutha (the unfailing One), One who does not give up on anyone. He governs everything. `pathim viswasya` (Lord of the universe), `viswam pa:thi` (protects the universe).\nYou may doubt if this ‘flight’ runs properly or not. You may doubt if this ‘pilot’ takes off properly or not. However, you need not doubt here. He is running this for many yu:gas (epochs). He is not doing this for the first time. He is not a new trainee pilot appointed. Not just yu:gas (epochs), generations of generations! Our sages say that we do not know what is the number of current Brahma (creator god). We don’t know how many crores of Brahmas (creator gods) have come and gone by. He has been the support for all of these since time immemorial. He is the One speaking now. In chapter 11, He shows Arjuna His supreme power when He was showing vira:tru:pa (the divine universal form). He showed earlier as well. He doesn’t have to show It today again. When He was in Duryodhana’s assembly, He showed the vira:tru:pa (divine universal form) then. He showed it when He was young as well. So, He is not someone who is making up something to accomplish some personal task.\n`mayi sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasya adhya:thma che:thasa: | nira:si:r nirmamo: bhu:thva: yudhyasva vigatha jvaraha ||`\nSo, Arjuna… “Do I have to now wage war, fight, and kill them? What happens to them? What happens to me?” “Is it sin or virtue? Do all the forefathers fall from the higher worlds because of this?” “Put all these thoughts away.” “It’s your vidhi (duty) to wage the war.” “You assembled here for that purpose.” “You are waging this war for dharma (righteousness), an act for prevailing order. Do it.” “Put all other thoughts away.” Saying so, Bhagavan (Lord) is taking Arjuna ahead in chapter 3, tuning him towards his responsibilities. Let us also move along with him.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nWhen does a person experience tension or grief? If the person takes responsibility for a task and it succeeds, he feels excited - thinking there’s no one like him! He feels extremely joyful and active. If not successful, he undergoes intense discouragement and disappointment. He puts himself in such a state when he feels that he is the doer. While it’s true we are doing the task on the surface, there is an underlying invisible power that enables us. That is called bhagavan (Lord). As long as that power indwells within us, we are called human beings. Or else, we will be dead bodies. In that case, people don’t leave us at home. The body will be disposed of outside. It will be made to disintegrate so it’s not visible anymore. Because that power is currently dwelling within, we are able to hear, see, eat, move around and do a variety of things. In fact, It is the One giving the energy, ability to think, enabling us to work. In fact, It is the One experiencing the result of work through this visible means [body]. It is named daivam (divine power). That daivam (divine power) incarnated as Sri Krishna to clearly show and clarify tattva (universal truths) to us. As Sri Krishna, It offered to us the greatest teaching that will forever be remembered as Bhagavad Gita (Song of God). It clarified about It’s tattva (universal truths) throughout [the scripture].

That day, Arjuna had to fight the war as his responsibility. Society positioned him there. He was in the war. The stage was fully set for the war. However, he turned away from responsibilities. He sank down to an unclear and depressed state. Sri Krishna took on the responsibility to restore him to a duty-oriented state. He taught Arjuna. He explained that he [Arjuna] is in the body and that He is with him. The body should work. It should be done through you. The body is the means. It is inevitable to get work done with it. The body is made as a combination of elements from nature. There are certain gunas (qualities) that it is composed of. They will show their effect on you. If you don’t want to be affected by them, you should either leave the responsibility on prakruti (nature) or on Me.\ngune:swa:ro:pya karthrutha: sarve:sware:va (Either leave them on the gunas or on the One underlying, Me.)\nHe instructed Arjuna about kartrutva (doership). What does it mean to leave the responsibility on Bhagavan (Lord)? We don’t see Him in front of us. It’s not like putting a cloth or a pot on His head or like putting fruit in His hand or giving something. What do we know about ‘where’ doership is? How do we ‘give’ it to Him? How can we submit doership to Him? What does it mean to give doership? What does it mean to sacrifice it? Is it an object to hand it over? Not at all. What should we do to give doership? Firstly, you should know that the inspirer is He. “The body belongs to Him. I also belong to Him.” “He is the One making things happen through me with the body.” You should know this first. If He is the one making you do, whose purpose is it serving? It should be for Him. Who should the result belong to? To Him only. This is what sacrificing kartrutva (doership) means. Because He is the doer, the result is for Him. It is phala tyaga (renunciation of results). Because He is the cause of the energy and inspiration, the attachment in this is with Him. It is sanga tyaga (renunciation of attachment). Because the object is His and it is working because of Him, He is the ultimate doer. Kartrutva (doership) is His. Mentally leave the result, attachment, and doership with Him and walk in the path instructed by Him. This is what one should be doing. He had to teach this to Arjuna so that he understood it. He started off saying… At least leave the responsibility on the body since you can see that it is the one working and not you. We are holding a pen and writing with it. It is the pen that is directly seen writing. Hence, we can say that pen is writing. Or… The hand that’s holding the pen… It belongs to Me. So, don’t leave it on the pen or on the hand. Leave everything on Me who made it write. Either leave [kartrutva] with Me or leave it with the pen. You can leave it on either side. However, since we are ‘knowledgeable’ and that pen or hand is writing because we are making it to… We impose doership on ourselves. If there is a good result out of a good writeup, we take the credit. If it does not look neat and is all twisted, we blame it on the pen. We take the credit for what is good. We try to blame the bad on something else. But, that’s okay. In our case, there are two. One is the body. The other is a tool called jiva (individual soul) who has the body. The One behind all of this is the One saying ‘Me’. It is because of the energy He gives that the work is being done. Hence, leave the kartrutva (doership). He said… Because you can literally see the body, at least leave it on the body. [Arjuna asks] “What are You saying? I am knowledgeable. The body is not knowledgeable. It is an achetana (inanimate).” [Arjuna asks] “Why are You asking me to leave it with that? I am wise, I am knowledgeable. Leaving it on…?” Arjuna’s face probably reflected some kind of insult or a blow to his ego. So, Sri Krishna says it’s okay you don’t leave things on the body. “I am the underlying One. I am greater than you.” “I am the One with shakti (power). I am sarvajna (all-knowing). I have sarvashakti (all powers).” “Leave it on Me.”\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni santhyajya (surrendering all actions to Me)\nWe talked about what His name is. He is called Bhagavan (Lord). We also learned about who Bhagavan (Lord) is. It means One who has all 6 qualities in total abundance: Jnana (knowledge), Shakti (power), Bala (strength), Aishwarya (opulence), Virya (valor), and Tejas (splendor). He does not have any others. He is sakala kalyana gunakara (the abode of all auspicious qualities). He is like a ghani (repository). He is durguna dura (free from bad qualities). Both these are called the identifiers. They are called lingas (identifiers).\nubhaya lingam sarvathrahi (two identifiers everywhere)\nVedavyasa stated this as one of the Brahmasutras.\nubhaya lingam sarvathrahi (two identifiers everywhere)\nHe has two identifier symbols. What are they? The first one is sakala kalyana gunakaratva (having all auspicious qualities). The second one is heya guna pratibhatatva (absence of bad qualities). That is durguna dura (free from bad qualities), One without anything bad. One with all that is good. He is all knowledgeable. He is not shy of practicing all the knowledge He has. He is fault-free. He can do this in any incarnation. This can be witnessed beautifully in the Ramavatar (incarnation as Rama). Anjaneya Swami went to Ravanasura. He stood in front of Ravana and talked to him. He conveyed to him all the hitam (benefitting words). Sri Rama came into the forests along with his wife as per the wish of his stepmother and His father. However, his wife was abducted by someone and could not be found. He came looking for her. He made friends with our king, Sugriva. He won back Sugriva’s kingdom for him from his brother Vali who threw him out of power. He used only one arrow and got Vali killed, getting Sugriva’s kingdom back to him. You know who Vali is, right? You were in Vali’s arms and roamed around all the 7 oceans. You may have forgotten. He brought down such a Vali with only one arrow. Sugriva promised to search for Sita. He sent all his teams to different directions. I came in this direction. I saw mother Sita in your place. That ‘object’ was found here. Hence, you are the responsibility. It becomes your responsibility because the missed ‘object’ is found with you. It is good for you to properly return that ‘object’ back to Sri Rama. I am saying this for your benefit. You probably don’t know all of this. You probably don’t know who mother Sita is. He explained who mother Sita is. He asked him not to carry such agni (fire) in his lap. He said he has come to tell him to do the right thing of returning mother Sita. He [Ravana] was angry and upset. He [Ravana] said he would harm him. Hanuman said… “Ravana, you think you got Brahma to grant all the boons you desired through tapas (austerities).” “You think you made Parama Shiva your friend by shaking the mountain.” “You think you made Indra your attendant by defeating all the devatas (demigods).” Remember…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbramha swayambhu:schathura:nano:va\nrudraha thrine:thraha tripura:nthako:va\nindraha mahe:ndraha surana:rako:va\nthra:thum na sakthaha yudhi ra:ma vadhyam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEven if Brahma, the self-born, four-faced one; Rudra, the three-eyed, destroyer of Tripura; Indra, the great lord, the killer of demons, all together cannot protect one who is destined to be killed by Rama in battle.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf Rama says He will put an end to you, each one of them will be fit for nothing. Remember that all three together also cannot protect you from Rama’s arrow. Be careful. Anjaneya Swami courageously expressed this before Ravanasura! Ravana did not pay attention to this. Anjaneya Swami made sure whatever he said was seen in actuality. Rama reached Lanka. He shot down Ravanasura. No one came to stop him and protect Ravanasura. On top of it, they all worshiped Rama saying dasoham (in Your servitude). We know this. This is Bhagavan (Lord). Because I have such great powers, leave it with Me. I will take care of It.\nphala sanga karthruthva pu:rvaka karma a:cha:rana (performing actions with the right attitude towards results, attachment, and doership)\nHow essential it is to practice one’s responsibilities, not just for Arjuna but for anyone! [Sri Krishna] clarifies it in verse 3.30. Let’s learn further.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nHuman beings are an intelligent species. Due to the effect of Nature, a person goes through ups and downs. Sometimes, he gets excited. At other times, he gets worried. He corrupts his work both at the time of excitement and worry. He won’t be able to apply proper active energy to his work in either situation. So, it is the quality of the wise to safeguard themselves from both. How do we do that? Neither excitement nor worry inform us ahead of time. We won’t realize that they have come until after they leave. Therefore, how do we put them under control? For that purpose, our Elders remind us of the underlying daiva (divine power) running us, teaching us about thatthva (reality). Veda declared this. Upanishads declared this.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nya a:thmani thistan ya a:thma:namantharaha\nyama:thma:na ve:da: yasya a:thma:sari:ram\nya a:thma:thmanamantharo: yamayathi\nye:shathi a:thma: antharya:myamruthaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe who dwells in the soul, yet is within the soul, whom the soul does not know, whose body the soul is, and who controls the soul from within, He is your inner controller, the immortal.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe dwells in all of us. We do not know He indwells. He indwells to regulate and run us. He dwells within and runs us. So, He is antharya:mi (the indweller). This is running because of Him. The entire outer layer is His sari:ra (body). What does it mean by the entire outer layer? What is visible here is the body. Underneath is the conscious ji:va (soul). He [individual soul] is also His [God’s] body. For us, this is the body. For Him, we are the body. He dwells inside us within the body. We don’t know this. He can’t be seen, right? So, we cannot realize that He exists. He does not become deficient because we don’t recognize Him. He is the One running everything. If you realize, He gives amruthatthva (eternity).\namruthaha a:thma anthraya:mi (the immortal soul is the inner controller)\nTo everything. It does not matter if it’s you or I. There is no question if it’s sentient or non-sentient. If a being exists in this world, that’s all it needs to have Him dwell within. It won’t know [that He indwells]. He will make it His body. He makes it work because of Him. There are two kinds of beings, che:thana (sentient) and ache:thana (non-sentient). We are sentient. So, we have jna:na (knowledge). Whoever has knowledge and learns, they are given extra a:nanda (joy) in abundance. So, He is amruthaha (unchanging). The outer layers keep changing. The body keeps changing. Our shapes keep changing. We (individual souls) don’t change in form but our qualities change. Our nature doesn’t remain constant. It keeps changing. There is change in shape and qualities of the body. There is no change in our form, but qualities change in different ways. There is no change in both for Him. Neither His form changes nor His nature. They are called swaru:pa swabha:vas (form and nature). Both don’t change.\nsada: e:ka ru:pa:ya (always in the same form)\nHe is always in the same form without change. Doesn’t He take incarnations though? In that case He changes. “Yes.” Then, why do you say He doesn’t. “He doesn’t.” Does He change or not? He changes but also doesn’t change. What kind of answer is this?! What it means is that He doesn’t change in the way we do. When and why are we changing? We are changing due to the effect of karma (actions and their consequences). We are being taken in the direction that karma directs. Our swaru:pa (form) and swabha:va (nature) change because of the effect of karma. How about the changes in Him? Karma is not the reason for that. It’s free will. The change in Him takes place because of His sankalpa (resolve). He named that as His a:thma (soul).\nmama:thma: bhu:tha bha:vanaha (it's My resolve that does everything)\nHis nature is not based on karma but His resolve. If He thinks He should change, He will change. We don’t change like that. We want to change but we don’t. He can change in the manner He wants and the way He wants. He can also make others change. He resolves that those who reach those worlds get a certain power. What is that certain power He resolves for them to have? “However they want to be, they should be able to attain.” That’s all. As per the resolve He made…\nsa e:kada: bhavathi thridha: bhavathi panchada: bhavathi sathadha: bhavathi sahasradha: bhavathi ane:ka da: bhavathi (He becomes one, He becomes three, He becomes five, He becomes a hundred, He becomes a thousand, He becomes many)\nHe gives them the power to take however many forms he wants. Not only does He change His form but also similarly empowers those who have faith in Him. So, He does not change due to karma but He can do whatever He wants. He is that One who indwells. If we leave the responsibility on Him because He has such capability and power… We can keep doing our work without any worry. A baby sitting in his mother’s lap has no worry. Is it raining, or hot, or is the floor rough or dirty, or are there any animals or birds around? There is nothing to worry about for the baby because he is in the mother’s lap. He will be by himself. The same goes for this ji:va (soul) as well. He is there to protect us like a mother and father. We are used to saying ‘like a’, but He is the mother and father. We were taught as children… You are the mother, the father, my companion, shade, friend… We were taught this when we were children. We are grown up now and we forgot it. If we develop the sense that He is there behind us, we can also be that courageous. Not only can we be that courageous, we can also meditate on Him continually. If something we wanted is not happening, it just means He is taking time on it. He is thinking whether it’s appropriate for us or not. However, since we have ‘extra’ jna:na (knowledge), we do something more than the non-sentient. We end up believing in whatever we see. We begin trusting that which we see is having an effect on us. They are called de:vathas (deities). We do upa:sana (worship) of many de:vathas (deities). We should worship only God but we don’t do that at times. We also worship de:vathas (deities) we come across.\nde:va manushya thiryak stha:vara (divine, human, animal, and stationary beings)\nThere are four types of bodies that souls ‘put on’ based on karma. Because of karma, souls take on four types of bodies. We are all the ones who put on human bodies based on our karma. We are not humans. Our bodies are human bodies. We are the indwelling individual souls. We must remember this. Not just us, every being, every soul around us in this world is the same way. Because we are the ones walking vertically forward on two legs, we are identified as humans. We are thus humans. Others, small or big, roam around horizontally on the ground or air or water. Because they go around horizontally, they are called thiryak (animals). There are some that are stationary, some appearing as having life, and others not. Like the trees appear having life. Stones and others appear to have no life. They remain stationary. They can’t move by themselves. If someone moves them, they move. If we move a tree from one place to another, it changes its position. Otherwise, it remains there. If the wind moves it, it moves. So, there are some that grow without moving stha-varas (stationary beings). Moving ones are either thiryak (animals) or ma:navas (humans). There is another type of body. They are also based on karma. They are de:vatha (divine) bodies. It is said that there are 33 crore de:vatha (divine) bodies. De:vatha (divine) bodies are 33 crore in number. There are some divisions in that. Like in human bodies, there are different types. Some are white in color, black in color, tall, short, fat, thin, etc. Similarly, amongst de:vathas (deities), there can be many types. To summarize, maybe it's 33 crore types.\nde:vathas (deities), manushya (humans), thiryak (animals) and stha:vara (stationary beings)\nHe is the only One who is the upa:sya (worshipable) for all the four. He is the One running all the four. He is the One who is antharya:mi (indweller) for all the four. He, dwelling in them, is the One who has all the four types of souls as His body. Therefore, there should not be a case where one of them worships another. All the four together must worship the indwelling One. However, is that happening? No. Some humans worship de:vathas (deities). Some de:vathas (deities) worship humans. God advised them to cooperate with each other and not worship each other. In chapter 3, if you step back a little earlier… All the de:vathas (deities) are supporting you. You should also do what’s appropriate for them.\nparasparam bha:vayanthah sre:yah paramava:psyatha (live well by being useful for each other)\nHe said that but He did not say that one is in the relation of worshiping one another. However, we can witness today how many we worship. It doesn't matter who one may worship to get any benefit. The underlying source of the power to give any benefit comes from Him (God) alone.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyo: yo: ya:m ya:m thanum bhakthaha sraddhaya: achyutha micchathi\nthasya thasya achala:m sraddha:m tha:me:va vidadha:mi\nsathaya: sraddhaya: yukthaha thasya a:ra:dhana mi:hathe\nlabhatthe:thaha thathah ka:ma:n mayaiva vihithanhi tha:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhatever form a devotee desires to worship with faith, I make that faith firm and unwavering for him. Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that deity, and from it, he obtains his desires, which are, in reality, granted by Me alone.\n-----------------------------------------------\nI am the One running things from behind. Because He is the One running, if the individual soul does not use the personal jna:na (knowledge), it will be better. However humans use their own jna:na (knowledge). They say some of it is theirs and the rest is the other’s. They started working with a selfish desire with each other. “What can I do? I will keep giving opportunities until they realize.” “If they can realize and get into the right path, it’s good.” He says this later in chapter 7. He is the One who is the source and the giver of all results despite the intermediate link. In verse 3.30, He says this.\nMayi (In Me)\nI am the One doing it. Leave the responsibility with Me.\nsarva:ni karma:ni santhyajya (giving up all actions)\nLeave the responsibility on Me for all the work. If you can do this, then…\nvigatha jvaraha (you will not have any kind of worry, difficulty, or loss)\nWhat is it that you should be doing?\nnira:si nirmama (without desire and without possessiveness)\nWhen you know that I am the One doing it, you will leave the results to Me and not to yourself. I am the One making you do it, you will leave the attachment to Me and not to yourself. Know this. In chapter 3, this is what Swami (spiritual teacher) is teaching humankind through Arjuna. He is trying to take us ahead. Let’s move forward.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Sanskrit is the most supreme language of all. It facilitates replacing the intent of many words with just a single word! Each word could have many meanings. If we are able to recognize why a certain word is used in a given context, we will be able to comprehend its intended meaning very clearly. Without knowing the context, if we don’t use the right meaning, it can yield undesired results. That is why it is imperative to know the accurate meaning of a word and the context in which it is used. Hence our esteemed elders provided detailed narratives to elucidate the scriptures. By the grace of God, these narratives mostly present the heart of the original author. Though at times, they may not. That is, occasionally some narratives could misguide us.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nGod, via Bhagavad Gita, gave an amazing ni:thi sa:sthra (moral and ethical science) to guide mankind. He gave us an adhya:thma sa:sthra (science of soul). Many great beings provided detailed commentaries on this. Lately, some who do not understand Sanskrit well or barely anything for that matter, have written many commentaries. We are unable to make up which of are suitable for us. Commentaries that explain every part of the subject while integrating them properly with the beginning and the end can be considered as appropriate. There are many such commentaries as well. Scholars agree that the premier commentary, close to the heart of Bhagavan (Lord), is the one offered by Bhagavad Ramanujacharya. The words and purports in that book are meticulously chosen by Bhagavad Ramanujacharya. He explained the meaning of all the words and letters. As part of the commentary written on Bramha Su:thra:s (Brahma Sutras), He says, su:thra akshara:ni vyakhya:ssanthe (I have tried to provide the accurate meaning of every letter, as per the etymological rules). He said - “I have tried to provide the accurate meaning of every letter, as per the etymological rules. Knowledgeable folk like you must decide if it is accurate enough or not. If you like it, approve it. You are all knowledgeable scholars who can differentiate essence from the rest. When you listen to an explanation you do not plainly downplay it as, “oh! You just beat your own trumpet for nothing”. Scholars like you do not exhibit these traits and are not envious. As knowledgeable folk, you can differentiate between what is right and what is not. I am presenting this commentary to you. It will present content that connects together properly. That is, it will clarify the opinion. Do think about it. Existing compendiums on grammar, laws and deep philosophy were referred. The meaning of sounds and words given were consistent with rules outlined in these materials. If you believe it is consistent with them, then approve this book, otherwise you may reject it.” He vows as such while presenting this book.\nWe encounter many such [contentious] situations in Bhagavad Gita! We must carefully observe those. In chapter 3 verse 30, He used the words, adhya:thma che:thas (mind fixed on the soul/God). [He said], ‘One should rest the responsibility of accomplishing any action, on Me! I will protect it and ensure it yields good results’. He declared to leave that onus on Him. However, our thinking is different. I am responsible for all this and worked so much for it, how can I leave it to Him? After I put in so much blood and sweat and worked very hard, how can I make Him responsible! No way! This is demeaning to me! There may be many ‘great people’ who would like to relieve God of that responsibility and instead make themselves accountable. Such people will have to deal with repercussions later. However, God fully protects those who make Him responsible for all their acts. In chapter 3 verse 30, He revealed how one should keep the onus on Him.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni\nsannyasya adhya:thma che:thasa: |\n...\nvigatha jvaraha ... bhavishyasi...\nSLOKA MEANING -\nRenounce all actions unto Me, with your mind fixed on the soul/God. You will then be free from anxiety and live comfortably.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe said, ‘If you put the onus on Me with the intent of adhya:thma che:thasa: (mind fixed on the soul/God), then there is nothing to worry about.’ What onus is that? sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasya (renounce all actions). ‘For any act you do, leave the results, the will, and the doership onto Me.’ This is what He said. What does adhya:thma che:thas (mind fixed on the soul/God) mean? That is the main question. Che:thas (mind) is manas (mind), isn’t it? What about adhya:thmam (that which is related to the soul/self)? It is that which is adhi (related to) in a:thma (soul/self), One that is at a:thma (soul/self) is called adhya:thmam (that which is related to the soul/self). What exactly is a:thma (soul/self)? It carries many meanings. That is where the problem lies. a:thma, ji:ve:, dhruthau, de:he:, svabha:ve:, parama:thmani (soul, living being, courage, body, nature, Supreme Soul) - and many more words can be used in place of a:thma (soul/self). So where can adhya:thmam (that which is related to the soul/self) be applied? That is the big question.\nWe hear about the word tha:pathrayam (three types of hardships)... tha:pathrayam (three types of hardships). It is colloquially used and heard. What does tha:pathrayam (three types of hardships) mean? [Some might say] “He has excessive tha:pathrayam (three types of hardships)”. Though it is colloquially used, there is another connotation to the word tha:pathrayam (three types of hardships). It means there are 3 types of tha:pa:s (hardships). After worship in temples, a priest gives ti:rtham (holy water) thrice. We also consume it thrice accordingly. Why is there a need to give it three times? There is a reason to it. We may face three types of hardships and they are called tha:pathrayam (three types of hardships). The ti:rtham (holy water) must be consumed to diminish the effect of those hardships on us. That ti:rtham (holy water) is perceived as the nectar obtained from the feet of God and that it will reduce their impact. We consume it thrice urging Him to reduce the effect of those hardships. It is not important for now, whether their impact is reduced or if it ends up getting worsened. However, we must take it thrice.\nWhat are those tha:pathrayam (three types of hardships)? An explanation was given. They are a:dhya:tmika ta:pam (hardship related to the self/mind), a:dhi daivika ta:pam (hardship related to divine/natural forces), and a:dhi bhauthika ta:pam (hardship related to living beings). Ta:pam (hardship/suffering) means a type of hardship. Isn’t it? Ta:pam (hardship/suffering) is a type of unbearable heat we face. It is not referring to external heat, however. It is heat felt internally. It is a suffocation experienced inside. It gets experienced in three different ways.\nOne is a:dhi bhauthikam (related to living beings), related to discomfort faced from various bhu:ta:s (life-forms/beings). Bhu:ta:s (life-forms/beings) refer to many life-forms. They can include other humans, animals, insects or anything else. If mosquitoes, flies, bedbugs, lizards, cats, dogs multiply and bother us, our nearby relatives bother us and their relationship becomes stressful, debtors are making our life difficult and so are our neighbors. Our stressful life is a result of myriad discomforts. It occurs due to humans or animals or various life forms we encounter. These life-forms are called bhu:ta:s (life-forms/beings). It is a type of emotional heat we face due to these bhu:ta:s (life-forms/beings). They are called a:dhi bhauthika ta:pam (hardship related to living beings). They cannot not exist. We cannot simply get rid of them. Because we live among them. We take that ti:rtham (holy water) once to seek strength from God to be strong in the face of a:dhi bhauthika ta:pam (hardship related to living beings).\nThe second is a:dhi daivika ta:pam (hardship related to divine/natural forces). Daivikam (related to divine/natural forces) means the different energies of nature that are around us and yet are invisible. Examples are heat from sun, rain, wind, freeze and many other types. They are ambient and impact us with their nature. We cannot bear excessive heat or cold or several days of non-stop downpour. They cause severe discomfort to us. It gets difficult to endure wintry weather as well. These all are the energies in nature. These are known as daivi: shaktis (divine powers/natural forces). Discomforts faced and the impact due to these on us are called a:dhi daivikas (hardships related to divine/natural forces).\nThe third is called a:dhi a:tmikas (hardships related to the self/mind). Also known as a:dhya:tmika ta:pam (hardship related to the self/mind). A:thma (soul/self) means manas (mind), mind. There are some worries caused by the mind. The mind is what is inside our body. Nothing affects us from outside, with everything comfortable and happy externally. However, we get evil internal feelings such as envy, jealousy, pride and anger. We are unable to bear others’ progress or we generate an emotional feeling inside, longing to show aggression or hurt someone. Many such feelings constantly arise within us. Anxiety is not caused here due to external influence. However, due to some reason, this is something we generate internally and crave for. Those that generate inside us and agitate our mind are called a:dhi a:tmika ta:pams (hardships related to the self/mind). It means those that are desired for and produced by the mind. In temples, we take ti:rtham (holy water) to pacify these discomforts as well. A:thma (soul/self) is the word in a:dhya:thmika (related to the self/soul). Though it is referred to as ‘mind’ here, it is relevant to the context. It can carry other meanings elsewhere.\nSri Krishna said in chapter 3 verse 30, adhya:thma che:thasa: (mind fixed on the soul/God). It means, che:thasa: (mind), mind, engrossed by adhya:thma (that which is related to the soul/self). Here a:thma (soul/self) doesn’t refer to mind, rather it means soul. adhya:thma che:thasa: (mind fixed on the soul/God) sannyasya (renounce). with che:thasa (mind) filled with knowledge of a:thma (soul/self). He says, ‘You must renounce the results of your work’. A:thma (soul/self) also means God. As alluded to before, a:thma (soul/self) indicates God as well. Without explicitly mentioning God here He referred to Himself by saying, mayi (unto Me) adhya:thma che:thasa: (mind fixed on the soul/God). A:thma (soul/self) can also mean parama:thma (Supreme Soul), Bhagavan (Lord). [Sri Krishna said], ‘With the mind filled with knowledge about a:thma (soul/self) and parama:thma (Supreme Soul)... Leave the results of your tasks unto Me... mayi (unto Me) sannyasya adhya:thma che:thasa: (renounce with a mind fixed on the soul/God). If you are able to leave that responsibility with Me, nira:si:hi nirmama ha (without expectations and without the feeling of doership). Then you will have no expectations on the results nor the feeling of doership. Give up the attachment to that task and be devoid of worry! You can live comfortably as well. Do that!’ Sri Krishna is thus motivating Arjuna in chapter 3. Let us move ahead learning what must be done with adhya:thma che:thas (mind fixed on the soul/God)!\nVande: guru parampara:m (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nFirst, an invocation:\n`a:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham`\n(I bow again and again to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nOf the many people surrounding us, a few are well-wishers. A few others wish to cause harm to us, while others simply ignore us. Those who wish good for us are positive people. Those who wish evil on us are negative. Those who ignore us, we call them passive. Hence, of those that surround us, there are some passive, positive, and negative people. We tend to gravitate towards those who wish us well and avoid those who try to hurt us. We ignore passive people sometimes and at times we don’t. That’s okay. While we are in this world, we have to coexist with all such types of people. It is required. We have to interact and have to work alongside them. Since this is a world, everything has a circular link with each other and is interconnected. We have to survive in such a world!\nRegardless of how you survive and in which timeline, one must always be cognizant of the supreme being behind all of this! What force drives us or those around us? What is ‘it’ actually? To learn about ‘it’, we generally call it daiva (divine force), God! It means that it is hidden, yet, it is the main force behind all. It works effortlessly and operates very easily. While operating, it manages smoothly with hardly any effort. Can it be seen while it’s operating? No, it is hidden. Therefore ‘it’ is called daiva (divine force)! `div kri:da` (divine play) and `div praka:sam` (divine light) are the two `dha:tuvus` (roots) of the word. There are many more as well. Let’s learn these.\nThe driving force behind anything is surmised as daiva (divine force)! It is sometimes also known as “Luck.” Our conversations usually go, “Wow, luck is in his favor!” or “it was my luck” or “it was my [bad] luck that this happened.” The terms “luck” or “fate” or “daiva” (divine force), they all represent the same thing. We also say, “This happened unexpectedly” or “This happened by coincidence.” Whatever we call `yadruccha` (random) or `ka:kata:li:yam` (coincidence)… Any such word means ‘a hidden divine energy behind the scenes.’ That energy is what we call “Bhagavan” (God)!\nBy its own volition, sometimes It descends into this world. When It comes down, It undertakes the task to uplift and protect this world. It tries to re-establish the degraded nature of humanity back to its intended state. It also tries to restore a destabilized societal system to its original state. It once did it during the great war of Mahabharata, just prior to the advent of Kali Yuga, which is around 5,500 years ago. That energy is called “Krishna” as it had an amazing form and appeared like an epitome of bliss. Also called as “Krishnudu.” He is also called “Bhagavan” (God) due to His divine qualities. Though He appeared to have descended to earth at our behest, He is different from us. He is therefore called “Purushottama” (Supreme Person). He is known as “Sastha” (Controller) and “Sarveswara” (Lord of all) as He can command anything from anywhere.\nWhere does He live and how does He look? History speaks of His pastimes in Gokulam, Mathura, or Dwaraka. However, He claimed He is omnipresent. Vedas wrote about Him as someone who is the indweller of all and surrounds everything. It proclaimed thus - `anthar bahischa tath sarvam vya:pyasthithaha` (He exists pervading everything, inside and out). He also shared detailed guidance called “Bhagavad Gita” that is part of Mahabharata. In it, He says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsarva bhu:thana:m hruddese: thishtathi:\nbhra:mayan sarva bhu:ta:ni yantra a:rudha:ni ma:yaya: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n‘I reside in the heart area of every being! Making all beings revolve as if mounted on a machine, by My divine power.’\n-----------------------------------------------\nHeart means the focal point of operations. Don’t ask where it is! Whether it is here, there, or somewhere else. He said, ‘I exist at the most critical place.’ For an airplane, the pilot cabin is in its nose area, close to its engine and other parts. The nose of the plane is tiny, while its body is large. However, the pilot sits in its nose area to guide it. In a roller coaster which rotates with its large circular body, the operator is tucked away in a corner. Some might have the operating cabin in the center of it. ‘I exist in the key operating area for anything.’ He called it `hruddesam` (the heart area). The operator inside is therefore called `hrudayaha` or `hrudayam` (heart). `Hrudayam` (heart) doesn’t mean the fist-sized heart. It is not the heart that palpitates with sound lub dub lub dub. `Hrudayam` (heart) is the name given to the indwelling central key area that operates.\n… `hruddese: thishtathi:` (He resides in the heart area) … `bhra:mayan` (making them move)\nI will dwell in a way to operate all of these as per its nature. Everything functions in their own way. Our ways are different from a bird’s or an animal’s or something else’s. Everyone has their own way. [Krishna said,] ‘I ensure the functioning of anything depending on their nature.’ How? Without their influence - `yanthra a:ru:dha:ni` (mounted on a machine)… One who rides a roller coaster has nothing in his control. He can only sit there in his seat as he is fixed to the chair. He can only scream ‘ho…ho’ and bounce in his chair. However, he doesn’t have the liberty to free himself. He can only get down when the ride operator stops the ride and permits him to leave. Instead, if he tries to free himself, it can be dangerous to himself and others. [Sri Krishna said,] “I am the One who ensures everything works properly.”\n`sarva bhu:thani yanthra a:ru:dha:ni ma:yaya` (all beings are mounted on a machine by My divine power)\n`ma:yaya` (by My divine power), He said, ‘with my incredible and divine resolve and with a unique and powerful trait.’ Vedas also claim the same.\n`Anthar pravistu sa:stha: jana:na:gum sarva:thma:` (He is the indweller of all beings, the controller, the soul of all)\nHe is `anthar pravistaha` (the indweller of all). In whom? `jana:na:m` (of beings), anything that takes birth by nature. It means, ‘I am an indweller for every being that takes birth and death by nature.’ He exists in other objects too, however, they do not need to be mentioned. These live beings must be enlightened though. Because they feel they are functioning out of their own volition. However, that is not true. ‘I am the in-dwelling One.’ What do you do seated inside? `sa:stha:` (controller), ‘I stay inside to instruct.’ For whom? Only me? `Viswa:thma` (the soul of the universe), I am there inside for all. He is called `prasa:sitha` (supreme controller). There is no better controller than He. `prasa:sitha:ram sarve:sha:m` (the supreme controller of all).\n[Some might ask] Isn’t `a:thma` (soul) said to be `anu` (sub-atomic, indivisible)? An `anu` (sub-atomic particle) means that which is puny, the subtlest particle of this universe or probably in this universe. Science used to call it something very small. Earlier, it was called atom. Later a smaller sub-atomic particle is called a substrate. Then smaller particles called quarks and many others were discovered. Now the smallest of all particles attained by dividing further and further… so far, by imagination, it cannot be seen with the naked eye, the smallest hypothetical particle they could divide to is called preon! P-R-E-O-N. They called it the smallest. We do not know how small it is. Smaller than this, according to our scriptures, is called `anu` (sub-atomic particle). Isn’t `a:thma` (soul) smallest of all? In that it cannot be destroyed! Now you say He [Sri Krishna] is its indweller. Only when it has sub-components, that something can penetrate it. If there are sub-components, then it can disintegrate. If He is inside, then the substance can be destroyed. If so, can `a:thma` (soul) be destroyed? Then [the answer is] No! He already alluded to it as, `ajaha` (unborn), `nithyaha` (eternal), `sa:svathaha` (ever-existing), `pura:naha` (ancient). Then how can He exist inside? That is because `a:thma` (soul) is engulfed with knowledge. Just like the light of a lamp entering the glow area of another lamp does not soak up one another… when `parama:thma` (Supreme Soul) permeates into `a:tma` (soul), His nature does not destroy it in any way. Vedas proclaimed this as well.\n`ani:ya:msam ani:yasa:m` (subtler than the subtlest).\n`Ani:yasa:m ji:va:thmana:m` (of individual souls), He exists inside the `a:thmas` (souls) as well! `Ani:ya:msam` (subtler than the subtlest), He is the subtler than the subtlest! He is smaller than the smallest of all! He is the indweller of `a:thmas` (souls). Why? `prasa:sitha:ram sarve:sha:m` (the supreme controller of all) so that He may wield his control on them to run the operations.\nSince He owns wisdom, at times there is a risk of a person (in whom He indwells) feeling the doer-ship of an activity. That threat is real today! He therefore shares wisdom to counter that threat. While sharing the wisdom in chapter 3, He says… ‘Make up your mind on something.’ What is that? “Leave responsibility with Me.” What should be the state of `manas` (mind)? It should have clear knowledge on the subject of `a:thma` (soul). Not just of `a:thma` (soul), it should also have a clear knowledge on the subject of `parama:thma` (Supreme Soul). If you let your intelligence dwell properly on this, it is known as `adhyatma jna:nam` (knowledge of the soul and God). It is the knowledge associated with `a:thma` (soul) or `parama:thma` (Supreme Soul). Mind should be engrossed in this knowledge. Then it becomes `adhyatma che:thas` (mind engrossed in the knowledge of the soul and God). We had mentioned earlier that `a:thma` (soul) can mean mind as well. Similarly `a:thma` (soul) can be `jiva:thma` (individual soul) or `parama:thma` (Supreme Soul) or can imply many other things. However, when this was said in chapter 3 verse 30…\n`sannyasy a:dhya:thma che:thasa:` (renouncing all actions to Me, with your mind fixed on the Self)\nSri Krishna said, ‘If you put your faith in Me… with the mind engrossed in clear knowledge related to `a:thma` (soul) or `parama:thma` (Supreme Soul)… you will have no hardships, nor face any challenges. You will be able to smoothly progress in life.’ What does ‘knowledge related to `a:thma` (soul) or `parama:thma` (Supreme Soul)’ mean? Let us move ahead trying to learn this.\n`Vande: guru parampara:m` (I bow to the lineage of teachers)\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is an amazing spiritual work.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat does ‘spiritual work’ mean? It is a treatise that qualifies a mind. It is also the scripture that bestows the mind with appropriate knowledge. Beliefs established in the mind form the basis of our life. Whatever the feelings that the mind generates decisively, our actions go on depending on them. Bhagavan Sri Krishna in chapter 3, verse 30, clearly elucidated on… ‘What knowledge must sprout in one’s mind?’\nIt is inevitable for everyone who takes birth to work. Isn’t it? When one harbors the feelings associated with those works as… ‘I am doing them’ or ‘this happened only due to me’ or ‘I did this for my own benefit’… The responsibility to experience the corresponding consequences rests with him. It means, this bondage results in forming a karmic record. That forms a ruchi (taste) suitable for leading one to certain types of tendencies. The higher the number of ruchis (tastes), they [intensified ruchis] become vasanas (ingrained behavior patterns). They are termed as ruchis (tastes) and vasanas (ingrained behavior patterns). Ruchis (tastes) means samskaras (behaviors) that are outward, while vasanas (ingrained behavior patterns) are ingrained behavior patterns. These are called ruchis (tastes) and vasanas (ingrained behavior patterns).\nDo you know of icebergs that are made of ice? There is a visible tip that is fairly small while it is quite huge underneath. Similarly, there are just a few ruchis (tastes) in us on the surface. However, many more ruchis (tastes) and vasanas (ingrained behavior patterns) which we are unaware of, exist underneath. Every act of ours is influenced by these. They either might increase our karma (bondage) or reduce it. They can affect either way. Because we are humans, let’s not let karma (bondage) grow [i.e worsen]. Instead try to curtail it. What happens if it reduces? ‘What happens’ means, our bondages then get eliminated. ‘What happens when they get eliminated?’ Then we can exist happily and comfortably. We will then be able to attain our true form and nature. We will be able to live without any hardships, whether it is here or in some other world.\nBhagavan is guiding us on how to do that. That is, the mind must possess an unwavering knowledge. This is very important. What does it mean by, ‘possessing an unwavering knowledge?’ It means, ‘the body is an external entity while I exist inside… A chaitanya murti (conscious form), Bhagavan is accompanying me… He inspires me and I survive with that inspiration.’ This concept becomes difficult to comprehend. We feel challenged to understand even the seemingly visible concepts. How can we reconcile the hidden us, [soul] and of Bhagavan who is underlying us? There came a need to reveal this [now]! He will descend to this world many times to divulge this to us. That is, the Great One Who is omnipresent and formless, assumes a form… restricts Himself to a place, takes a limited shape with a limited meaning name, descends to this world. By sharing wisdom, and through His action, He does what needs to be done and eventually returns to His original state. Sri Krishna is one such form that descended to this world. The wisdom He shared then is called Bhagavad Gita. In there, He clarified these concepts too.\nThe wisdom that is scattered widely throughout Vedas (ancient scriptures) and other scriptures… the knowledge that is belief-associated in our minds… He assimilated that extract into one place, Bhagavad Gita and shared it with us. He explained it in Chapter 3 on how one should engage in their work. He called it Karma Yoga (path of action). There He says, ‘The concepts of Atma (soul) and Paramatma (Supreme Soul/God) must be pervaded in your mind clearly. Then you will be able to dedicate the work done and… leave the feeling of doership, attachment, and the results of action related to that work, to Me. That will not cause any sort of fever to you.’ Fever here means hardship or sadness or bondage. He said, it [Karma Yoga] will help you avoid these.\nWhat is that wisdom related to Atma (soul) and Paramatma (Supreme Soul/God) that we should gain? He put a name to it, called it Adhyatma chetas (mind focused on the Self). He called the mind filled with this knowledge as Adhyatma chetas (mind focused on the Self). ‘Using this [mind], leave the ownership of all acts unto Me.’\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni\nsannyasy a:dhya:thma che:thasa:\nSLOKA MEANING -\ndedicate all actions to Me with a mind focused on the Self\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is it about God that we should be aware of? The intent of all the scriptures is simply to reveal this. Even in Bhagavad Gita, He clarified this in many instances. The main purpose of all Vedic literature is to clarify this for us. What is it exactly? To reveal the relationship between God and us [i.e. atmas (souls)]. What is that relationship? We did not come into this world because we wished for it. We did not get this form out of our choice. The Ones who bestowed this to us are known as father and mother. Mother, with her divine grace, raised and nurtured us nicely. Father sowed the required seed. We attained this form and this body due to their grace. This is for one person, for an individual. This process exists in humans, animals, and within every living being.\nThere is a Supreme father who enabled all beings to attain form and characteristics. He is the Viswa Pitha (universal father) and Viswa Mata (universal mother). Because the elements of Nature make up these bodies, Nature is our mother. The One who structured Nature to provide such bodies to us is the Viswa Pitha (universal father). Vedas (ancient scriptures) proclaim, pathim viswasya (Lord of the universe), that He is Viswa pati (Universal Lord). If a question ‘Who is He?’ arises - it is answered Hrishchathe Lakshmischa patnyou u (Hri and Lakshmi are His consorts)… Vedas (ancient scriptures) claim Him as the husband of Sri (Goddess of prosperity), mother Lakshmi. He is Sri Maha Vishnu (Lord Vishnu)! Besides other names, we call Him Narayana (God). He is the karana (cause)… He is solely responsible for His son’s or daughter’s form and characteristics. We are aware that the reason behind an offspring’s form and characteristics is the father and mother. God is the father and the sole karana (cause) behind this world’s form and characteristics. We are all His karyam (the result). There is a correlation between these entities and Himself. What is that connection? It is karya-karana sambandha (cause and effect relation). This is not a made-up connection. It exists naturally. Saying, ‘I won’t believe it’, will not affect its existence. Not believing is our misfortune, however, the association will not be affected. Sun gives sunlight. If you say ‘I won’t believe in Sun’, then it is your ignorance and bad luck. Sun loses nothing as a result. Air helps you survive. If you say, ‘I won’t believe in it’, with no faith, you will die. God is the cause behind this entire universe. Whether you believe it or not depends on your impressions, the reality however does not change. He is the karana tattva (the causal reality). He is the father. These are all His offspring. Therefore, the association between the world and Paramatma (God), is a father-son relationship. World here means us. Therefore, it is between us and Him.\nIt is Paramatma (God) Who helps us survive, provides what we need and protects us from threats. That trait of His which sustains us with necessities and protects us from threats is called Rakshaka (protector). The receiver of this benefit is called Rakshyam (protected). There exists a relationship between these two. That association is called Rakshya-Rakshaka (protected-protector) relationship. The relationship between us and the God is similar. He is the Rakshaka (protector). Every being in this world is protected by Him. All beings belong to the Rakshyam (protected) group. Therefore, there is a Rakshya-Rakshaka (protected-protector) relationship. No living being operates as per their own whims. There is a driving force behind all. That who drives is called Seshi (master/owner) and the one that functions with this inspiration is called Sesha (servant/belonging). Sesha (nature and souls) belong to Seshi (God). God has them as a belonging. That is the relationship between these two. That association is known as Sesha-Seshi (servant-master) relationship or the feeling of Sesha-Seshi (servant-master) relationship. The reason we are all doing okay today is due to the underlying support from Him, whether visible or not. The fact that these bodies are surviving indicates that Atma (soul) is inside and supporting it. That is, Atma (soul) supports it. This body needs that support. Therefore the body is called bharya (the supported) and Atma (soul) is called bharta (the supporter). That is, they have a supporter-supported relationship. A similar relationship exists between body, soul, and God who supports us from inside. These two [body & soul] belong to Him and… He is the indwelling One who drives, holds and supports. Thus, there is a supporter-supported relationship.\nWe possess intelligence. However, the purpose of intellect is to know the indwelling tattva (reality/truth), Him. Hence, it is Him who is the vishaya (object) of intellect. One with intelligence is called jnata (an intelligent person/knower). We are all jnatas (knowers). It means, we possess intelligence. It isn’t a question if we are using it or not. We do have it. If we leverage it then we are putting it to good use. Otherwise, we are simply wasting it away. The purpose of intelligence is to realize the indwelling driving reality called Bhagavan (God). This is jnatru-jneya (knower-known) relationship. The information to be known is called jneya (to be known). One who knows is called jnata (knower). We have jnatru-jneya (knower-known) relationship with Him. We did not acquire any of these objects.. These are all His ‘objects’. He is the indweller possessing these objects. These objects belong to Him. One who possesses these objects is called Swami (owner/master) and the possessions are Sottu (possession) or Svam (possession). This relationship is called Sva-Swami (possession-owner). If He approves, we exist. If He disapproves then life as we know it ends. He is the adharam (foundation/support) of all. Those that depend on Him are called adheyas (dependents). So there is adharam-adheya (foundation-dependents) relationship. We already referred to the inner being as Atma (soul) while the external entity is called sarira (body). Atma (soul) is the indweller, that enables the body to function and leverages the body for its own needs. Sarira (the body), is the one that survives and functions for the sake of Atma (soul). All living beings are sarira (body) and He is Atma (soul). This relationship is known as sarira-sariri (body-soul) relation between Paramatma (God) and the rest of us. If we are taking in or consuming something, it means He is the receptor, not us. If He decides to leave the body, and we try to force feed honey or castor oil, the body cannot consume. However, now we are aware, as He, as the indweller, recognizes the inbound food. He recognizes the consumed food and makes us aware of it. He, being the indweller, is the One who enjoys it. As the One enjoying our experiences, He is called Bhokta (enjoyer). The objects meant for His enjoyment are called Bhogyam (object of enjoyment). Entities such as souls and nature are Bhogyam (object of enjoyment). The indweller Paramatma (God) is Bhokta (enjoyer). This relationship is Bhoktru-Bhogyam (enjoyer-enjoyed).\nPitha (father), Rakshakaha (protector), Seshi (master), Bharta (supporter), Jneyaha (to be known), Adharaha (foundation), Swami (owner), Atma (soul) and Bhokta (enjoyer)… are the nine associations that Atma (soul) and Paramatma (God) have. [Sri Krishna said],’Arjuna! you and I have similar associations. I am the Atma (soul). You are sarira (body), and I am sariri (soul). Once you are aware of this, you will realize that it is not the sarira (body)… instead sariri (soul) is the one who experiences the acts done by the sarira (body). Then, [realize] the fruit of the action is Myself! The purpose of sariri (soul), when he is enjoying the fruits of action, is to not let sarira (body) work hard. He exists inside so that sarira (body) can be happy. Hence, I always ensure happiness to you. In that case, you have to dedicate the results of action to Me. Why do you try to own these results? When you realize this, when you become Adhyatma chetas (mind focused on the Self), you will not focus on the results. nirasih (unfocused on the results). When I am the One who is doing the act, why do you assume that it is you instead? A hand never thinks that it is doing the act. Being the indweller, I am the One doing the act. Therefore, sarira (body) should never assume ownership. It should always assume that it is for sariri (soul). Then you will be devoid of attachment. Instead, you will rest your focus upon Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnirmamaha bhu:thva: yudhyasva vigatha jvaraha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nbe free from possessiveness, fight without anxiety\n-----------------------------------------------\nThen you will not be disturbed or worried in anyway. Being inside, I will take care! While sharing this wisdom to Arjuna in verse 3.30, Sri Krishna is moving ahead. Let us also move along with Him. Vande guru paramparam (I bow to the lineage of teachers). Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBhagavad Gita is ever-refreshing irrespective of how many times one reads or listens to it. That’s because it is the best scripture that paves the way for a good human life. It is therefore ever fresh like a human life. We have been observing this life for many days. There are mornings and evenings followed by more mornings and evenings. Though it is the same Sun, heat, wind, water and earth every day, we rise every morning with new hopes. We begin life afresh every day. The experiences, from what we see and those that visibly surround us, are new.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all prosperity, and delights the entire world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBhagavad Gita is the ultimate instruction we have received, to enlighten us on how to mature through such new experiences of life – how to transform everything seen or acted upon into a yajna (sacrifice) – with that, how to properly utilize this valuable opportunity, i.e. this human life, ensuring we do not fall back into this life-death cycle?\nEspecially in Chapter 3 it was shared that Bhagavan had bestowed this human life to us only so it can be used to perform yajna (sacrifice) continuously.\nsaha yajnaihi praja:ha srushtva: (Having created beings along with sacrifice...)\nThen He said, ane:na prasavishyadvam (By this, you shall prosper...). Use the body for the needs and act accordingly to fulfill yajna (sacrifice) to attain prosperity and contentment.\nBhagavad Gita is not a scripture meant to evoke feelings of despair in life, or make one give up all his possessions, or drive him into isolation. It is an ultimate message of God that reveals how to transform what you already possess to attain great prosperity. Chapter 3 reveals many details on this concept.\nIn Bhagavad Gita, chapter 3, Sri Krishna says -\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasya:\nadhya:thma che:thasa: sannyasya:\nnira:si:hi nirmamo: bhu:thva:\nyudhyasva vigatha jvaraha || BG 3.30\nSLOKA MEANING -\nRenouncing all actions in Me, with your mind fixed on the Self, free from desire and proprietorship, fight without feverish anxiety.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is the cardinal instruction that He shared. ‘You should not stop any activity - yudhyasva vigatha jvaraha (fight without feverish anxiety), war suits you now.’ Everyone wages their own war in life. Some with their family, some with their kingdom, some with their social status while others with something else. Should we fulfill the duty ordained to us or not? One must do it! It feels difficult. How to do it being vigatha jvara (worry-free)? How to fulfill it without feeling any discomfort? For that, He gave us a solution. What must one be like?\n...nira:si:hi (without desire for results) nirmamaha (without sense of ownership)...\nnira:si:hi (without desire for the fruit) - do not enjoy or desire the fruit of the activity.\nnirmama (without assuming ownership) - do not assume ownership of the act, i.e. do not think that you are the one who is really making it happen.\nHow is that possible? With adhyatma chetasa (with an enlightened mind), if an act is done with an enlightened mind. How to do it? Change your feeling. How to change it?\nmayi (on Me)...sannyasya (renouncing) - rest your focus on Me and do it!\nWhat should be focused upon You?\nsarvani karmani (all actions)...mayi (on Me)...sannyasya (renouncing) - Whatever the act is, there is a feeling behind every act. With the act of eating, assume that you are doing it to please Me and that it’s delicious for Me. Isn’t that what we assume and do? Imagine we work in an office setup. What is that feeling we work with? That this work suits me, I like it and it helps me survive. Therefore, I must do the work to please the superior. We work thinking like this, don’t we? A feeling exists behind any act being carried out. Sometimes it is for the self and at other times for others. However, a feeling certainly accompanies the act. How should this ‘feeling’ be dealt with? Keep this ‘feeling’ onto Me as I am the reason behind you.\nHe already enlightened us about Himself in detail earlier. That He is the ultimate being, Sarvaswami (Lord of all)! He is the owner of all. He is the one who drives all. All the moving or static beings in this Nature, those that wander about or those that cannot... He is the supreme for all such beings that He kept under control. He is also the reason for their state of existence. Because He ensures their existence, He is called sarveswara (Lord of all). What does it mean? That these are His possessions. Since He is the reason... possessions always act according to the user’s direction. They always act to benefit their user, not for their own sake. Imagine a pencil. Its utility is meant only for the writer, not for itself. Whatever is written using it, is not meant for the pencil. It does not feel for the benefits or challenges arising out of the written output, nor utilizes them. Instead, the writer will use them.\n[Similarly,] you are an object. There are only two objects in this Nature. One is achetana (insentient). The other are jivas (souls). “These two belong to Me!” He said in Bhagavad Gita many times. ‘Therefore, these two are the objects. As I am the One driving these two entities, they must benefit Me!’ Since the achetanas (insentient beings) do not have any intelligence by default, they do not think otherwise. The real problem is with only one species amongst these beings, i.e. humans! We do not know if other beings think much about this or not. A human that tasted success, may harbor feelings such as ‘I am doing this or it is happening because of me or it should benefit me’. However, he must be told that this is not an appropriate thought process. Because that ‘feeling’ leads him to bondage. If he can transform this feeling positively, he can avoid this bondage. A human has this capability and he deserves it. With that [self-centered] feeling, he engages in it and leads himself down the gutter. In the cycle of life & death, he surfaces to the top [with a human birth] occasionally and then falls back down. He keeps rising up and then keeps falling down. As long as he keeps the ‘feelings’ positive [while doing an act], he keeps rising. When those feelings get polluted, he keeps slipping down. The cycle of life & death does not stop however. We don’t know how many eons it has been or how many years have passed. Is one stuck in this vicious cycle forever? One must escape from this eventually, correct? A human does possess the tool to escape this vicious life cycle! God is therefore enlightening a human. He is sharing how it must be done.\nWe typically tie an auspicious decorative garland to the main entrance of a house. That garland works to enhance the beauty of that entrance. It does not act to benefit itself. Neither the entrance nor the decorative garland are sentient. Both do not have a life. The decorative garland, whether it is made of flowers or pearls, looks ordinary when not in use. However, when it adorns an altar, it enhances the beauty of that altar. The value of this decoration lies entirely in augmenting the value of others. In scriptural language such objects are called paragatha atishaya adhayaka (that which enhances the value of others). This is when both are achetanas (non-living beings). If we wear a garland around our neck, is that for the sake of the garland? Or would we say the garland is beautiful? No, we wouldn’t. Correct? A garland is worn to make us look beautiful. It should make us happy. We can observe this in our world. In case the garland demands that you wear it for its sake or to enhance its beauty... that becomes unacceptable. The purpose of a garland is to make us look better or feel happy. As for chetana (sentient) and achetana (insentient), the garland is the achetana (insentient) and we are chetanas (sentient beings). And that garland we wear benefits us by making us look grand. The aforementioned door entrance and garland are both achetanas (insentient beings). Whether it is a chetana (sentient) or achetana (insentient), one who wears it should feel happy and grand. This is the order. Similarly, when both are chetanas (sentient beings) like an animal under our care... it should be beneficial to us in a manner fitting our nature. In the case of a small baby, the baby does not act to make himself look better or happy. Instead, he acts to make the one who is holding him happy or entertained. Therefore, whether both are chetanas (sentient beings) or one is chetana (sentient) and the other is achetana (insentient)... or both are achetanas (insentient beings), they act to glorify the second one.\nSimilarly, we also must act to glorify the Supreme energy that is behind us. Everyone has this Supreme energy driving them. Acting in a way that glorifies this Supreme energy, God, or in a way that makes Him happy... is righteous and is the order of Nature. If one recognizes this and acts accordingly, his feeling [during any activity] is in a ripened state. Sri Krishna has qualified this state as adhyatma chetas (enlightened mind). If one acts in this ripened state, then he will be devoid of the feeling – ‘I am doing this or I am enjoying its fruits or its glory is enhanced by me alone’. He will then become a niraasi (without desire for results) and nirmama (without sense of ownership). When will this happen? If he renounces the above feeling associated with any act being done. Then, any act by him is qualified as yajna (sacrifice). He will also not accrue any sort of bondage. Bhagavan Sri Krishna is alluding to this in chapter 3.\n...yudhyasva vigatha jvaraha (fight without feverish anxiety)||\n‘You will not get any ailment. Then any act by you will yield no bondage.’ He is proclaiming this to Arjuna, “This is My philosophy and is My belief,” He said, [in verse 3.31] ye me matham idam nithyam (those who always follow My teaching). Chapter 3 elucidates how a life must be conducted. How to lead a happy life. With that, one can elevate oneself from the current state to a higher state. It guides us to a state where one doesn’t need to slip to lower states [of life]. Let’s try to move ahead in this path.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBhagavad Gita is the essence of all Upanishads. The purpose of Upanishads is to guide mankind on how to lead a good life. They are numerous. Just like Vedas are infinite, so are Upanishads. One human life will not suffice to sufficiently learn and comprehend the essence of all of them. Therefore, Bhagavan (Lord), during Sri Krishna avatar (incarnation)… extracted the essence of all Upanishads and shared it as Bhagavad Gita. In Bhagavad Gita, He directs us on the duty we must do. He expounded on topics such as… What work one must do. How to do it. What benefits accrue when done. We attained this human life after toiling extremely hard. However, we are not aware of that. We observe other living beings. Human life is unique when compared to their lives. Once a human life is attained, the aim should be to rise higher from here. However, we should not revert to a life of an animal or a bird or a tree or a germ or an insect that we see around us. A human naturally wishes to rise to a life form that is superior to him, such as mukthas (liberated souls), those who were liberated and are serving the Lord, or nithyas (eternal associates), those who serve the Lord eternally. Everyone desires a better existence. Isn’t it? How far can one rise? The target should be the limit one can ever reach! Our aim should always be the ultimate! Our resolution on the ability to attain this goal depends on… “How far can we reach? How hard can we try? What help do we get from those around us?” However, we should resolve to aim very high! What should a human aim for? That he should not return to this bonded life! The current bond we experience is known as karma (actions/consequences). This bond does not have to go away instantly. Someday, this body has to be given up! Once it is gone, one should aim to get another body that is not restricted… that is, a body without ‘limited access’ and ‘limited abilities’. Upanishads spoke of such a body, called muktha deham (liberated body) or nithya deham (eternal body). How can one attain this? Is it possible to liberate oneself from the clutches of karmic bonds? It is not possible by our effort alone! In Bhagavad Gita 3.31, Sri Krishna says, “However Arjuna! I can bestow that to you.” What did He say?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nye: me: matham idam nithyam\nanuthishttanthi ma:nava:ha |\nsraddha:vantho: anasu:yantho:\nmuchyanthe: the:pi karmabhihi || BG 3.31\nSLOKA MEANING -\nmuchyanthe: (one will surely be liberated)\nWho? All. Whoever that may be.\nFrom what?\nkarmabhihi (from all the karmas).\nBy doing what?\nsraddha:vantho: anasu:yanthaha (at the least, one must have dedication and not be jealous)\nAnuthishttanthi, what can be said of those who are able to do this?\nWhat should they do?\nye: me: matham idam nithyam (in My opinion)\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe elaborated on that in the prior sloka, 3.30.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni\n….\nnira:si:hi nirmamo: bhu:thva:\n….\nadhya:thma che:thasa: … sannyasya:\n….\nyudhyasva … || BG 3.30\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn that, He said, “Do your duty, enhance your bhava (feelings), keep that focus on Me… Do not assume that the act was done for your own happiness or for your benefit… Also, do not assume that the act was accomplished only because of you. Carry out the act focusing on Me.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen anyone says this, naturally a feeling might arise - ‘Why such compulsion? Is He really that great?’ However, someone has to share this. At least, He has to convey this about Himself. Therefore, He shared this about Himself. However, when He speaks about Himself, we feel like He is boastful. What you might feel is not important, however, it’s crucial to know what benefits you. ye: me: matham idam nithyam anuthishttanthi (those who follow My eternal teaching) He said, “Leave all the ownership of actions to Me. Do the acts. Transform them into yajna (sacred offering) when doing them.” Because He already mentioned at the beginning of chapter 3 that…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:th sarvagatham bramha\nnithyam yajne: prathishttitham || BG 3.15\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYajna (sacred offering) is the root of the cycle of life. It is crucial, like a hub of a cycle. Everything is dependent on this hub. Life in entirety needs the support of such yajna (sacred offering).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSo we know what yajna (sacred offering) means - Sri Krishna explained it at that time. Yajna (sacred offering) includes praying to devathas (deities/divine powers). Devathas (deities/divine powers) are all the spirits that surround us in Nature, to aid in our life. Wind is one power. Water is another. Cold & heat are others. These are all the powers that exist in Nature. A human life is sustained only with support from these powers. Therefore, do not insult them and do not abuse them! Make proper use of them. If you take care of them, they will bestow adequate support to you in your life. [Sri Krishna said,] … parasparam bhava yanthaha (mutually nourishing each other)… This is not a new phenomenon - i.e. protecting nature. Conserve water, use it sparingly. Keep the earth clean, maintain greenery. We think these are new principles to abide by. Sri Krishna mentioned this in Bhagavad Gita. ‘This Nature supports your life! Each power embedded within it is a divine power, i.e devatha (deity). You should serve it properly. Water the trees and sow new plants; conserve water, do not waste it. Do not pollute the air and breathe easily. Do not misutilize land - instead, cultivate it. Enjoy its crops. Rains will be sufficient. If you do your work properly, then Nature will support you in equal measure. However, if you abuse Nature, you will surely face its fury. Beware! While living a life respecting Nature, you should mutually support each other. He said, ‘Living a life supporting each other is known as yajna (sacred offering)’. We do not know how many such powers of Nature exist. We tend to put in many efforts to attain what we care for. Large dams were built in Himalayas. Many tunnels were dug there for large trains to operate. Many such things were done. What was the impact? Apparently, the houses around Jyoshi Mattham (Jyoshi Math) [near Himalayas] are crumbling. Other damages are also happening nearby and in other places. By not being able to appropriately leverage what Nature provided, or by misusing it… or by wasting resources, we suffer disastrous results. Ignorantly, some call it ‘Nature’s wrath’. There is no such thing. Nature does not have a vision nor life nor intelligence to avenge. It does not have any of that. However, if you misuse it, repercussions naturally teach us a lesson. Therefore, respect Nature to live life. Both must co-exist. We do not know all the varied powers embedded in Nature. ‘Instead of trying to understand Nature, enlighten yourself about Me - as I guide Nature. Act as per My guidance, as I can control that Nature as well. This is enough!’ This is what He said. ye: me: matham idam nithyam anuthishttanthi (those who follow My eternal teaching) …. …My guidance, My instruction… …matham (opinion) means, in my opinion. It does not mean another new doctrine or religion. This is His opinion, this is how one must exist. If you are able to uphold it, then anuthishttanthi (it must be followed). What is the use of simply listening to it? It must be followed. When should that be followed? And Where? nithyam anuthishttanthi (follow eternally) from the time you were born to your last breath Every act done must be carried out with that feeling. This is a bhavana vishesha (special attitude of mind), aspect of feeling and thought. This thought must be attached to every act being done. The process is called anusandhanam (constant remembrance/meditation). When such thought accompanies the act, you will realize that… He is the owner, the act is done for His sake, and is carried out because of Him. It can’t be followed on just one day, as once in a blue moon, and ignored for the rest of your life. When you breathe, you wouldn’t say that “I inhaled a single huge breath and now I am done.” No, would you? One has to breathe continuously, throughout life. Will you stop drinking water, saying that you drank fully the day before? Can we even stop that? We need to keep drinking daily. The feeling should be perennial, nithyam anuthishttanthi (follow eternally). This act belongs to God. He is the Supreme and He is the Owner of that act. A human must realize that, since Nature belongs to Him alone… Nature and one should operate according to His directive. Nature will follow His directive anyway. I am the one who is unable to follow, with my arrogance. Therefore, I need to change accordingly. Man alone must incorporate the thought of the Supreme in his acts. One who can do any act associating it to God is known to be following anushttanam (spiritual practice/observance). Anushttanam (spiritual practice/observance) does not mean sitting and chanting. It means associating the thought of God with every action. ‘The act is His, He is the owner and I am His object. Therefore, He enables me. As He is the owner, the entirety of the act belongs to Him. As He is the owner, the act can only be carried out because of Him.’ One must recognize this. The act just needs to be carried out with this thought. Nothing needs to be stopped. One just needs to alter the thought process. This is what He conveyed. Whoever does this, as nithyam anuthishttanthi (follow eternally)… He isn’t telling it to just anyone… He said this to manava (human), He is telling this primarily to humans. Therefore, whoever does this, he is known to be a sraddhavanthaha (one with dedication). Do it with shraddha (dedication). Else, if it gets tedious to do anushttanam (spiritual practice/observance), then at least exhibit a strong desire. Show urgency, ‘I wish I could also do it this way!’ Then that person is known as a sraddhavantha (one with dedication). Even if you are unable to, at least have a deep desire to act that way. One might say, ‘I do not have the commitment and will address this at a time when I’m inclined’… …anasuyanthaha (without envy)… Even if you do not have the desire, at least you should not be envious of those… who share this knowledge or who are able to follow it. If you can at least operate this way… muchyanthe: the:pi karmabhihi (even they are liberated from karma) One who practices it will certainly be liberated. If one has shraddha (dedication), cannot wait to practice it, he will be liberated. At least if one isn’t jealous or doesn’t envy those who practice it… …the:pi…muchyanthe: (even they are liberated) even they will be free from this bondage Thus, it is entirely possible to be freed. That can happen only in a human life. Therefore, utilize this opportunity. Put this human life to good use. Bhagavan (Lord) is guiding accordingly in Chapter 3, verse 31.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nDharma is defined as an act of a good deed. A deed is said to be good when it yields happiness in life and makes those around us happy. It is good for us. It gives good results now and also in the future. Such an act when carried out is called dharma. …dhriyathe: dha:rayathi (that which is held, that which holds)… When done, the act yields contentment now and protection in future. Such an act is called dharma. Mahabharata presents a nice sloka (verse) about this dharma.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndharmaha srutho:va drushto:va\nkathitho:va krutho:pi va\nanumo:ditho:va: raje:ndra: |\nnayathi indrapadam naram\nSLOKA MEANING -\nO King, dharma, whether heard, seen, spoken about, performed, or approved, leads a person to the state of Indra (heavenly abode).\n-----------------------------------------------\ndrushto:va (seen) a good deed is that deed when seen as others are doing it… gives us also an opportunity to do it after a certain period of time. We observe this in certain animals… By persistently training them, a man is able to make it follow his commands! [For example] police canines are able to open doors. They get trained for a while on how to open them. Later, they do it themselves. Similarly, cats can do it, so do certain birds, lions, bears, just as we witness in a circus. They can do it! How are they able to do it though they are unaware of it? They do not have that inclination at all. So how are they able to do it? They first view the act; the trainers ensure the animals view it. The animals observe such acts constantly for a while and the trainers guide them to copy what they do. If a good deed can be mimicked after prior observation, then it’s fine! Even if they are unable to do it, then drushto:va (seen), i.e. even if you have observed it once earlier… and as you continue to witness it over a period of time… there is a chance that you will eventually feel, ‘There’s nothing wrong with it, maybe I should do it too!’ Even that can help one become wise. That is, drushto:va (seen).\nsrutho:va (heard)… Imagine you did not have the opportunity to witness it. Typically, we view those good deeds when elders do them. However, if we have moved to a far away place to western countries… We do not have an opportunity to observe much of others doing certain recommended acts. It is ok. srutho:va (heard)… If you hear that someone used to do a certain act … and that they attained a specific benefit when they that an act in a certain way – Karna tha:dithamu? (Is it Karna's beating?) Initially when we hear of it, we tend to ignore it. The second time we hear of it, we’ll pay half-attention to it. The third time we feel familiarity with it. The next time, we feel inclined to hear about that good deed. Therefore, just prolonged hearing about it may lead one to transform in a good way. So, one may engage in good acts after witnessing them or… listening about them for some time or acting on after hearing about them. One does not have to just do them… one may act on it after hearing about it because he felt good about it.\nNormally, when we hear bad news, we immediately want to spill it out somewhere. If it is bad news, we stop others and forcefully shove it down their throats… even if they dislike listening to it, similar to spoon feeding a baby his food forcefully. If it is good news, we do not feel like sharing it. Good news when heard becomes ‘invisible’, akin to a drop of water added to milk. It gets ‘evaporated’ inside us. However, bad news is not like that! Like a drop of water on oil, it must zigzag here and there! That news has to be shared with someone. It must be dumped in someone’s ears and ensured that it’s heard! This is the trait of bad news. If it is not shared, one’s stomach bloats, as if pregnant for 9, 10, 18 months or more! It will make him restless and nauseous. A negative message is not meant to be shared while a positive message must be shared! We don’t know why, but one doesn’t feel like sharing a good message. Many benefit from the good out there. They are benefitted from Nature, other species, and elders. We hear about and see many types of good deeds. Those good acts heard, seen and known, though they are known to be good … it is unfortunate that one doesn’t feel like sharing those with another human. There is no greater benefit to someone’s life than to share the good with a few! Spread the message in a group. Ensure they hear this! Every human must cultivate this. Every minute, Nature helps us in various ways.\nVedas say, bhadramulu anni vaipula nunchi naa pai prasarinchu ga:ka (may all auspicious things reach me from all directions). Good keeps getting sent our way. How many are you sharing that with? How many are you able to share it with? Every human must introspect on this.\n[In Mahabharata,] Yudhishtir says, kathitho:va (spoken about)…if you are unable to do it, it’s ok. Share what you know with others. Even just by sharing you accrue benefits of virtue.\nKrutho:va (performed)…if you are able to do it, there is nothing better than that. First, one must hear about it, to be able to act on it. It must be contemplated on. It should dwell in the mind. Only then will it take the shape of an action and transform or result into an act. If you tap on an object gently, it will yield a response. However, for an act to happen in a human, the thought must ‘bake’ well in the mind. It is great if one is able to actually act on it.\nHumans tend to emulate others. Other species are able to behave independently, but humans learn by imitation. They learn by seeing others perform. See the good in the world and try to emulate it. There’s nothing wrong in copying good behavior. We hear of ‘Imitation … Imitation’, don’t we? Imitation is fine! When it is for good causes. When it is of good activities.\nOnce, Gopikas (cowherd women) [in Dvapara Yuga] did a vratham (religious observance). In a later time period, approximately 200 years later, Goda Devi, also known as Andal… She heard of this vratham (religious observance) done by Gopikas (cowherd women) and tried to copy it. Copying is not a wrong thing. However, that copied act yielded a better result for her than for the Gopikas (cowherd women) themselves! Earlier, Gopikas (cowherd women) desired to serve Sri Krishna. They were blessed with the opportunity to serve Him temporarily. Afterward, Sri Krishna left Nanda Gokulam for Mathura without ever returning, as per history. Their vratham (religious observance) yielded benefit only to that extent. Later, Goda Devi copied them and did the same vratham (religious observance). She benefitted more than the Gopikas (cowherd women) from this. Goda Devi’s vratham (religious observance) is known as Dhanurmasa Vratham. We recently completed it. In that Dhanurmasa Vratham, Goda Devi was able to attain Bhagavan (the Lord), the deity of Sri Krishna. She was blessed with staying there with Bhagavan (the Lord) permanently. She was also blessed with guiding millions on that divine path. Whatever she heard and saw, she followed…krutho:va (performed)…she did it. What did she get by doing it? She benefitted multi-fold as compared to Gopikas (cowherd women). Also, she did kathitho:va (spoke about it). She did not keep the experience of Bhagavan’s (the Lord's) grace to herself. It persisted so much that even today we are able to follow it. Even today, millions follow Dhanurmasa Vratham. She bestowed 30 songs [pasurams] to provide support for us in following it. What did she do? kathithaha (spoken about) …. kathitha (spoken about). She sang those slokas (verses) and gave those songs for the world to follow. It is said, pa:di koduttha:l…chu:di koduttha:l narpa:ma:lai… pa:di koduttha:l…narpa:ma:lai (if sung and given… if worn and given, a good garland… if sung and given, a good garland). A garland worn and put aside by her was offered to the Lord. She submitted, to Sri Krishna, a garland of songs about her experiences. She attained the ultimate benefit of staying with Bhagavan (the Lord) even today in the deity form. She also gave those songs to us so we can derive those great benefits as well. This is also an imitation. Such imitation is also good. Initially we have to listen or observe or speak or follow these good acts.\n‘These won’t work for us. These won’t yield any benefit for us, therefore we won’t take them up!’ It is ok. Someone else is doing or listening or observing this somewhere, at least do not disparage him. Do not deflate the one who is doing it. Do not deflate the one who is listening to it. Do not deflate the one who is following it. Dharmaraja (Yudhishtir) said, anumo:ditho:va raje:ndra: (or approved, O King). Even if you are unable to do it, let the other one who is doing it, do so in peace.\nKamsa could not be like that. Sri Krishna was brought up far away, in Nanda Gokulam. He was living there and apparently growing up. He couldn’t ignore it, like, ‘He is somehow living there. I’ll handle Him, if and when He comes’. He came up with an excuse to draw Sri Krishna near. His attitude was either to disturb Him or His tools or His environment. He invited Sri Krishna and faced death. Goda Devi said in Her Tiruppavai Vratham, ‘Kamsa faced death’. Anumo:dithaha (approved), what if he had agreed to Sri Krishna’s survival? Both would have survived. Unable to exist like that, his life was nirupenna ninra neduma:le: (O Lord who stands without comparison). Goda Devi said in Tiruppavai Vratham, kanjan vayaththil niruppu (fire in Kamsa's stomach). Bhagavan (the Lord) did not burn him down on His own. Kamsa’s attitude of not being able to anumo:ditha (approve), ignited a ravaging fire in his heart resulting in his death. It is enough not have this intent. Anumo:ditho:va raje:ndra: (or approved, O King), if he could agree on being good, that is enough.\nBhagavan (the Lord) expounded on the same in Bhagavad Gita’s chapter 3 verse 31.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nye: me: matham idam nithyam\nanuthishttanthi …\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose who constantly follow this teaching of Mine...\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is nice if one can adhere to it. At least anasu:yanthaha (without jealousy), do not feel jealous about it. They will become good. Moving forward in chapter 3, Bhagavan (the Lord) is sharing the minimal acts one needs to do to become a better human.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nThe most critical step in human progression, whether one acquires good qualities or not, is to be sure to stay away from bad qualities.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAmong those bad qualities, the most dangerous is asu:ya (jealousy). Slightly better than that is i:rshya (envy). The qualities of jealousy and envy make a man a:shraya:saha (easily destroyed), just like a dry stick burns down entirely upon catching fire. Jealousy and envy, if sprouted in a human, eventually destroy him entirely.\nWhat does envy or jealousy mean?\nEnvy is the burning sensation in one’s mind rising from intolerance for someone else’s growth or their goodness. Some people are unable to suppress that emotion and want to spill it out somewhere. While spilling it out, they project even the other person’s good qualities as bad. That quality is called jealousy.\ndo:sa ro:paha gune:shu asu:ya: (condemning good qualities with jealousy). Therefore, jealousy means living a life condemning others though they possess good qualities. It is natural for those around a prosperous man to feel envy or jealousy. This exists in businesses, politics, and even in one’s daily life. Whether it is in a business or at home or with students or in any competitive situation of life, there is a possibility of such jealousy to occur.\nSo, should there be competition in life or not?\nCompetition must exist, however, it should be a healthy one! Competition that destroys another is prohibited. Competition should increase cooperation but it should not damage the other ends. Whenever there is a conflict, instead of wishing for personal growth, one typically prays for another’s stalled growth and failure for those on a successful path. This should not be there! As the other person grows, if competition arises, then with one’s hard work, one should strive to elevate himself to match or become better than the level of the other. He must be trained as such.\nWe’re not sure what transpires among animals with jealousy, but humans get the feeling of ‘I must decimate others first!’ He does not focus on improving himself! Instead, he prefers to pull others down to his level and then feels, ‘Great! At least the other one is not successful anymore!’ We discussed this earlier during chapter 1 of Bhagavad Gita. That Arjuna also harbored such feelings of jealousy. We even discussed how it manifested. ‘It’s ok if I do not make it to heaven. But I cannot bear their entry to heaven!’ It is ok if he [Arjuna] did not go. [The feeling of] ‘It is ok if I lose one eye, others should lose both eyes!’ This is called jealousy! He can mind his own business, get on with his life and focus on his own welfare! Why do we get agitated seeing another’s growth? It is not in the nature of a human to see and ignore. This attitude of feeling resentful of others… The other person may have worked hard, earned well by saving every penny and eventually grown to heights. However, he doesn’t want to put in hard work and is incapable of toiling. The other guy worked hard and grew. Why couldn’t you slog away as well? No! Instead, he gets skeptical of the other saying, ‘I wonder what he did to get there?’ He unfairly accuses and tries to pull others down, whether on moral grounds or something else. This is jealousy and is an extremely dangerous quality!\nSri Krishna advocates us to become anasu:ya (one without jealousy). You should not have jealousy. The other one is surviving on his own, let him be! He is working to live a life, let him do it! Why do you have to feel agitated? However, it is not like that. One without jealousy will eventually become an athri (one who resists the three qualities). Thri (three, slave to three qualities) means one who is a slave to three qualities of nature. What are those three qualities? They are satthva (goodness), rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance), fused together. These three exist intermingled inside him. He becomes a slave to them. He drifts aimlessly along with them, and gets carried away in life. He is called a thri (slave to three qualities). One who is able to resist their temptations is called an athri (one who resists the three qualities)!\nHe says, …samathi:thya thriguna:ni yatha:n… (one who transcends the three qualities). He must free himself from the effect of this ‘thri’ (three qualities). How is he able to extricate himself? This is not something he can achieve with his own effort. This is like quicksand. If you notice, the bottom of quicksand is all sludge. Feet don’t find any support in there. If one slips and falls into it, he will repeatedly get sucked into it. Similarly, one who is under the influence of these three qualities of nature will face a downward spiral in life. He cannot extricate himself with his own effort.\nSri Krishna said, ‘I can help you out of this situation.’ Earlier in verse 30, He said - …mayi … sannyasya… (surrender to Me). “Leave the ownership to Me! I can help you. …aham samuddhartha: bhava:mi… (I will lift him up)! Put your trust on Me! Link your feelings with Me. Now carry on with your duty and effort.” He isn’t saying, give up your effort! He did not say to become nishkriya (effort-less). Instead, He asked to continue doing duty while leaving the ownership to Him. Lord (Bhagava:n) says, ‘Then I will handle it’.\nWhen is this a possibility for us?\n‘First, you must have faith in Me! When I share something, you shouldn’t react like - [Sarcastically,] ‘Sure, He is a great One who shares advice while relaxing in His abode! Anyone can give advice when they are not engaged! Only with skin in the game, will He know.” Such statements get uttered often. However [thri] doesn’t feel that, Lord (Bhagava:n) has also been there, and endured, surviving that well. That he is now able to guide well because of that! Instead, he thinks, ‘Sure, He says many things. Anyone can share advice easily. Only the one enduring it knows. And we are the ones who deal with it.’ Lord (Bhagava:n) says, ‘It is better not to think like that. Therefore, mayi sannyasya (surrender to Me), link your thoughts with Me always. To be able to do that, you must trust My explanations. You must listen to them, followed by contemplation. They must be trusted. When you come across them you should not feel – ‘He keeps saying something and is always self-boasting as if we are gullible.’ Such statements should not be uttered. First, you must focus on what is being said. To be able to keep focus, one must be interested in it, which leads to a sense of urgency. This will cause one to make an effort.\nHe says, ‘When this occurs, I will support you accordingly and ensure its progress in every stage. Just because I support you, do not treat it frivolously as if I am doing it for self-benefit. I do not get any benefit or incur any loss, whether you gain anything out of your effort or not.’ How does it help Lord (Bhagava:n) if we gain or lose from our own effort? We are just a small speck in His purview. Isn’t it? For someone who has this entire universe in His purview, we all are ignorable personalities that do not even equate to a sub-atomic particle. He is the master of many worlds and is beyond ours. Where is the need for Him to cast an eye on us? Despite that, He descends for our sake and stays inside us as well. Later He says, ‘It is I as your indweller that makes you tick!’ In the last shatkam (six chapters) He says, sarva bhu:ta a:saya sthithaha bhra:mayan (residing in the hearts of all beings, causing them to move). ‘I made everyone’s heart my home as I must ensure the operability of this chariot [i.e body]. To make their wheels of time move, I exist in their hearts.’ Where is the need for Him to do this? The essence of His explanation is that one doesn’t need to feel jealous of Him. That is very important.\nOne must be free of jealousy. You become athri (one who resists the three qualities). Interestingly in Ramayana, when Lord Rama with Sita begins exile in the forest, the first night, i.e after he asks minister Sumanthra to return, they visit Sage Athri (one who resists the three qualities) and Anasu:ya’s (one without jealousy) hermit. They spend the night there. Then Mother Anasu:ya (one without jealousy) gifts a beautiful sa:ri to Sita. She says, ‘As you are enduring 14 years of exile, I am giving you a sa:ri that will never get soiled. She then also gifts an unused necklace and kumkum that never depletes. She says, ‘Use these and you will never face any hardships!’. While Sita is conversing with mother Anasu:ya (one without jealousy), Sage Athri (one who resists the three qualities) is speaking with Lord Rama. She is listening attentively to what Sita is saying of Her childhood. Wondering if she can handle the travails of living in a forest, she asks Sita, ‘What was your childhood like? At the wedding, apparently there was a large bow of Lord Siva?... I’d like to hear all the interesting things that happened then.’ Though she knew already, mother Anasu:ya (one without jealousy) wishes to hear from Sita. She listens excitedly to how Sita’s wedding unfolded, how Rama broke Lord Siva’s bow and so on. Later she gifts those accessories to Sita. She is Anasu:ya (one without jealousy), one who is glory personified. Her husband is Athri (one who resists the three qualities). He is beyond the influence of Nature’s three qualities, while she had conquered jealousy. Wherever these two exist, i.e traits of athri (one who resists the three qualities) & anasu:ya (one without jealousy), even Lord (Bhagava:n) Himself becomes subservient there [like Lord Rama and Sita]. Even Lord (Bhagava:n) listens to them obediently and follows their guidance.\nSri Krishna mentions this in chapter 4 that such people are called thathva drashtas (seers of truth). He says, ‘One must surrender to them as they have a divine vision of the future’. In Chapter 3, he directs us on this. What is needed? …shraddhavanthaha…anasu:yanthaha… (those with faith, without jealousy). Those devoid of jealousy are – mucchyanthe: the:pi karmabhi:hi (they are freed from actions). The reason - They have detached the feelings that could cause bondage and linked those with Me. They are in …mayi sannyasya:… (surrender to Me). He thus gave the most critical lesson of life to us, to be devoid of jealousy. Many calamities such as destruction of entire kingdoms or countries result because of someone’s jealousy. It destroys many lives. Jealousy is the most dangerous quality. It is critical to be free from it. We should never feel jealous of Lord (Bhagava:n). One should not say, ‘He can do many things. What is the big deal for Him?’ If we are able to live without jealousy, then it will lead us onto a great path, a royal path. A path where we can be blessed with the grace of Lord (Bhagava:n) – It helps us to stay away from the bondage of karma. Let’s all make an effort to free ourselves from jealousy! Let’s try to become athri (one who resists the three qualities)!\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n*a:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m lo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham* (I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nElders always aid us in many ways to help improve life. They share great learnings and show us the path of virtue. If interested to tread it, they show grace by lending a hand to us in embarking on that path. Our duty lies in utilizing that offer of help. Listening to their teachings is our duty. Observing their lifestyle without finding faults is our duty. The reason – we are the ones who need the transformation for good. We are under the clutches of bondage. So, the need is ours! If benefitted, the gain is ours as well. If we unshackle ourselves from the bondage then we alone stand to attain bliss. We must focus on the One who can bestow this to us. We must put our trust in Him. We must not feel jealous when we hear His teachings. We should not resort to, ‘Why not feel jealousy...? Just because He can and knows that we are listening, He speaks whatever! What has He got to lose?’ One who feels jealous this way, will not have another opportunity to try and transform himself, ever.\nAfter enduring many lives amongst bugs and microorganisms… *chira:ya* (for a long time) in his *sthothra ratna* (gem of hymns), states our *Ya:muna:cha:rya Swami* (Yamunacharya Swami). In reality no one knows how long we have been mired in this bondage of nature. We do not know how many waves of cycles [birth & death] we have overcome. *…nimajjathaha anantha maha:rnava:nthaha…* (sinking in the endless great ocean). *maha:rnavam* (great ocean) nature is like a big ocean. We have been stuck in this for an unknown time, experiencing many lives… existed in different forms and there has been no end to this. However, we have finally attained human life now! We are lucky to have this [human] life. Other beings do not function with intelligence. They are only aware of their physical form and can only respond with it. A human is able to listen and apply logic. Intelligence of human life enables one to visualize clearly what is heard. We ought to leverage that intelligence. We receive benefits continually in this life. However, to what extent do we transform them favorably for ourselves? Those who are able to leverage these tend to rise rapidly in life while others stagnate or get degraded in life. We need to ensure the human life attained after so much toil, does not go waste. We must try now to rise higher from human life. We must strive to gain a form that bestows pure bliss. Everyone wishes to achieve greater things and does not aim to degrade in life.\nWhat must one do to achieve this? One must realize that all of us belong to God. That He is the *se:shi* (owner) for all! We are all *se:sha bhu:thas* (subservient beings), belonging to Him. Realizing this is enough. He revealed this in earlier *slo:ka:s* (verses) of Bhagavad Gita. As He is the indweller. He is prepared to accept anything that results from the endeavors as long as we do not interfere in that process. Some might say, “Why would we do so?” We forget that there is something called *ahanka:ra* (arrogance). Having been overpowered by this *ahanka:ra*, we are binded and blocked. Life degrades. Life degrades like something sinking into quick-sand, slipping further and further. “It is enough if you do not resort to this,” says *Bhagava:n* (Lord) in 3.32 verse. He says –\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nye:thv e:thad abhya:su:yanthaha\nna:nu thishttanthi me: matham |\nsarvajna:na vimu:dda:m stha:n\nviddhi nashta:n ache:thasaha || BG 3.32\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf one does not have a focus or interest or inclination towards what I shared and despises it, he gets a brain that is incapable of experiencing feelings! One who abuses it, will get a tongue that is incapable of speech! One who tries to torture it, will either receive hands that cannot move, or a body that does not need or have hands.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBut, I will not accept [any disrespect to it]. You have a good life now. You must use it well, isn’t it? What if you were to be led astray? *ye:thv e:thad abhya:su:yanthaha* (One who hates My teachings with jealousy), does not believe or follow them. He neither trusts nor accepts My word, yet opposes it, like Sisupala [Sri Krishna’s cousin]. We pray to Sri Krishna with flowers and chant *ashto:ttara sata na:ma* (108 names), that extol His divine acts. Those are the names that Sisupala spoke as well. However, his intention was warped! He was *abhya:su:ya* (jealous). Everywhere and anywhere, he spoke of *Bhagava:n’s* (Lord's) acts with jealousy. He did not heed Sri Krishna’s advice. What did He do instead? [In Yudhishtir’s royal court] When Sisupala began to hurl abuses at Him, the Lord started to count… One, two, three, four, etc. as per the vow given to Sisupala’s mother. He kept mum until the count reached 100. Soon it started to cross over. Sisupala’s downfall wouldn’t stop after 100 hurls, isn’t it?\nOnce the stem detaches from its tree, the fruit rapidly rolls down to the ground. The reason for its fall is neither the tree nor the stem of the fruit. The stem is responsible only for the initial breakage - called *a:dhya pathanam* (initial fall). Initial fall leads to the second roll and then the third and so on, due to the pace. The reason for the initial fall and subsequent slips is the momentum gained. This momentum causes a second roll after the first, third roll from the second and so on, leading the downward spiral. It leads one to the abyss. It is hard to drive a rock up the mountain. One or many have to toil hard to move it up. Once at the top, if it begins to roll downward, it can easily crush everyone in its path on the way down. His life is also similar. Sisupala couldn’t digest Sri Krishna’s brilliance. He couldn’t bear to see the honor conferred by Bhishma and others to Him. That is jealousy! He started to condemn Him for having bad qualities which in fact are good qualities. Sri Krishna heard them. However, He promised Sisupala’s mother that He will bear 100 insults. Not just 100! In his flow, he couldn’t stop and insulted *Bhagava:n* (Lord) further and further. What did He do to him? He was delegated down to a life where Sisupala neither has a chance to use his mouth nor senses, any further. He faced *na:sam* (downfall) … *viddhi nashta:n ache:thasaha* (know them to be lost, without intelligence).\n*sarvajna:na vimu:dda:m* (deluded in all knowledge)\n*viddhi nashta:n ache:thasaha* (know them to be lost, without intelligence)\nHe will lose the chance to leverage knowledge. If he uses legs to commit mistakes, he attains a state where walking with legs is affected. If he uses hands to commit mistakes, hands become crippled. If he uses eyes to commit mistakes, *Bhagava:n* (Lord) gives a state where the vision is impacted. If he uses mouth to abuse, speech is affected in the resulting state. He puts them in a life where they are impacted accordingly. *sarvajna:na vimu:dda:m* (a state where knowledge cannot be applied). Think of a rock where a soul exists. Yes! A rock also requires a soul’s presence. However, what is the use? The soul inside exists in a state where *Bhagava:n* (Lord) has shut all doors for the use of knowledge. He at least gave the trees an opportunity to grow, according to their *karma* (actions/destiny). Animals were given the ability to walk, according to their *karma* (actions/destiny). Though they have a tongue, speech is restricted. Such a state was given.\n*sarvajna:na vimu:dda:m stha:n* (deluded in all knowledge)\n*viddhi nashta:n* (know them to be lost) …\n*nashta:n* (lost) – He says, “I will destroy them.” What did He mean by this? It is a state where it cannot be ‘seen’.. It does not mean making it [soul] non-existent. Though it exists and depending on what sins he committed, He will ensure the respective conscious ability is lost. We say ‘money was lost’. It means it has gone away from me though it exists elsewhere. It is with the one who took it from here. Some say - ‘I lost my gold’ or ‘I lost my land’. The land is still there! It’s simply that the owner has changed. Similarly, gold doesn’t change. It is not with him now but with someone else. It is not with him anymore. *Na:sam* (downfall) means making it non-existent for the one who earlier assumed it was his… *viddhi nashta:n* (know them to be lost). Till what stage? *ache:thasaha* (without intelligence). One has the ability to enhance consciousness, like we do now. We use our tongue for speech, vision for eyes. Similarly other *jna:ne:ndriya:s* (senses of perception) and *karme:ndriya:s* (senses of action) are leveraged by consciousness to carry out our tasks. However, one who feels jealous [of God], think of the degrading state it leads him to. It results in a life where he is unable to leverage consciousness fully. If he doesn’t possess that to begin with, then it is ok. [Sri Krishna says] “I can make sure he gets a state where despite having the ability, one cannot use it. However, I do not wish this upon anyone. You should not be like that. You must get better. To become virtuous, you must listen, accept and follow [the guidance].\nHow to follow it? Do it [deeds] for Me! Recognize that I am the indweller and the cause for everything that happens. With that thought, begin your work. What happens then? Every work becomes a *yajna* (sacrifice/offering)! This is what He shared. He in fact, begins chapter 3 with this. *saha yajnaihi praja:ha srushtva* (having created beings along with sacrifices) use *yajnas* (sacrifices/offerings) to get better, by offering them to Him. He did not deter anyone from living their life nor sought to stop anyone’s work. He didn’t ask to ignore responsibilities. He didn’t stop us from enjoying the results of work. He just wanted us to be devoid of the desire for results. He kept it very simple here! He gave an easy solution for us. He did not prohibit us from doing anything! If He had asked us to avoid eating, then we would be distraught. He did not ask us to avoid food. Whatever one consumes, one must recognize that it is for the indweller. Treat the intake as *prasa:dam* (food offered to God). That’s it. It would be difficult if He had asked us to avoid food. Instead, He let us partake of the food. Make it a delicious item, however you desire and enjoy it! He says, “I am your indweller who consumes and digests it for you. Therefore, work by recognizing that I am the One who transforms that food into energy.” How simple is this? You do not have to avoid baths. While bathing, think that you are cleansing a temple. Sleep, but feel that you are giving the temple [body] a rest. Eat, with a feeling that God is consuming the food. Enjoy the deliciousness, imagining that it is for the indweller. No need to avoid anything. Just change the *bha:va* (intent) behind the activity. However, the same intent can portray another as a bad person. This is wrong. Do not lose that ability to possess an intent by resorting to bad behavior. We did not get to use this intent in prior lives except in this current human life. Why would you want to lose this opportunity? We must strive to make use of it in a better way. This is what God wills. He clarified this in 3.31 verse. Let us move along.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nChapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita is an important chapter on how to leverage any activity as a ‘tool’. A tool here indicates a means or yoga (method), and the activity is called karma (activity). Transforming the activity we do as a tool that elevates us is called karma yoga (yoga of action). This is fitting for humans and is the reason why Bhagavan (Lord) tries to educate humans.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAgain and again, I bow to Lord Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and is beloved by the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe says, anuthishttanthi manavaha (humans follow), in verse 3.31. Why? For example, no one tries to teach a tree, as it cannot understand. No one tries to teach an animal as it also cannot comprehend. Only a human is capable of comprehension, hence an effort is made to teach. Not making an effort to learn, though being capable, is an offense.\nOccasionally little kids grab a doll, decorate it, sing and play with it to pass time. Especially tiny tots do this when they buy such a toy. They do not expect a response as they are aware of it being a doll. On the other hand, as a human is not a lifeless being, we do expect a response from him. We expect a response only from a human but not from a doll. Despite being a human, if he does not respond then he is worse than a doll. Bhagavan (Lord) instructs in chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita, that one should not be that way. A human can utilize every karma (activity), every activity he does, to fulfill the purpose of his life. He can transform everything into a karma yoga (yoga of action) and get benefited from it.\nThere are a few tools available to transform karma (activity) into a yoga (method), jnana (knowledge) into a yoga (method), and prema (devotion) into a yoga (method). There are various yogas (methods), i.e., methods, to benefit from. One can leverage any of these. Everyone desires to gain more with minimal effort. In fact, one feels it is better if benefit accrues with no effort at all. This is a common weakness of human. A human is like a tool, he must work. He is a tool that possesses knowledge. That knowledge must be utilized to enable us to do our work [karma (activity)]. In simple terms, this is what Bhagavan (Lord) instructs in chapter 3.\nKarma (activity) must be done as a yoga (method). Why? It means karma (activity) should be done. Work must be done, whatever is your duty. For Arjuna, his duty is to wage war. So, he must. Bhagavan (Lord) says, ‘One must do the work that one is appropriate for or that is designated for.’ He outlined a few reasons for this. What are they? He gave three reasons.\nFirst - the body is habituated to do activity. The body is used to doing activity akin to how water flows down a slope. It is difficult to send water upwards. One must toil using a pump and a pipe. But you do not need to do anything to make it flow downward. Gravity ensures it flows down automatically. As a human body is made for activity, allowing it to do activity, keeps it suitable. [Bhagavan (Lord) says,] ‘Do it as it is easy.’\nSecond - doing ordained activities will not pose a threat. It is dangerous to do an unknown activity. If one, who does not know anything about chemistry, walks into a lab...thirsty...he’ll probably drink liquid from a random white bottle, as everything looks like water to him. If it is an acid bottle, he will lose his life! It is arduous to take up any unknown activity. For a human, doing karma (activity) is non-hazardous. Why? It is meant for the body. The body is made for the activity. Along its journey, it is natural to experience ups and downs occasionally. One must learn to deal with them. A boat when sailing in a river or an ocean will encounter large and small waves. It is natural for it to rock back and forth at that time. When navigating the boat, one must learn to prevent it from capsizing. Instead, if you let it drift, the boat might end up in a wrong destination. That should not happen! Therefore, there is no risk in doing karma (activity). One is it is easier, do it because we are used to it. Second is, do it because there is no risk.\nIn Bhagavad Gita, what was Arjuna’s intention? He thought, ‘Why should I work at all? I should give up on the war. We are used to surviving in the forest anyway, we’ll move there. No one will be troubled then.’ Such thinking is wrong! If doing the act is natural for you, then do it! He interpreted sitting in the forest as doing deep meditation. As he thought jnana (knowledge) is superior to karma (activity), he intended to do jnana yoga (yoga of knowledge). However, it is not for him! Even if one is qualified to do jnana (knowledge), he must do karma (activity). Bhagavan (Lord) establishes this in chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita. He presents Himself as an example along with other eminent scholars. Initially He offers King Janaka as an example and later presents Himself as well.\nname parthasthi kartavyam (Arjuna, I have no duty to perform)...\n‘Why do I need to do it? What do I lose if I don’t do it? Yet I am doing it, isn’t it? Without ignoring karma (activity), I do what suits Me. No one is allowed to ignore it, even if they are qualified to do jnana yoga (yoga of knowledge)! It is better for him to do karma (activity) as well.’ One reason is that it is easier. Second, it is risk-free.\nThird - others could be misguided by observing you. If you skip doing karma (activity), then others will think, ‘When he can skip it, so can I! Why should I do it?’ Such situations could arise from misleading others. Therefore, doing karma yoga (yoga of action) is preferable in view of your welfare and of others. In fact, one does not need to levitate towards the path of jnana (knowledge) or bhakti (devotion). If one does karma yoga (yoga of action), i.e. if an activity is done as prescribed, and transformed into a yoga (method)... that will yield an imperishable benefit of life i.e. moksha (liberation), liberation of soul from bondage of life and death, and niratisaya ananda (state of supreme bliss). Duties ordained to you are sufficient to make you attain such a state. That activity can be anything. For a cobbler, it could simply be stitching shoes. For a farmer, it could be tilling a piece of land. For a priest, it could be praying to a deity. For a student, it could be engaging in studies. For a family man, it could be doing family chores. Whatever is his ordained duty, engaging in its activities will directly lead one to a state of liberation. It will also unblock any hurdles along the way. For how long? It can guide until one attains Bhagavath sakshatkara (God realization). Therefore, even if one deserves or is qualified to do jnana yoga (yoga of knowledge), it is always beneficial for him to do karma yoga (yoga of action).\nSome might imagine complexity when words like karma yoga (yoga of action) or jnana yoga (yoga of knowledge) are uttered. They simply mean ‘follow your duty’. Keep engaged in your work. In Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan (Lord) establishes in numerous ways that... Because work is ‘formed’ for a human he must be focused and engaged in it. However, one must learn the process of doing it, isn’t it? It isn’t right to do karma (activity) without proper knowledge. Doing it just for the sake of it, is also not right. It must be done after learning the proper way. How must it be done? Bhagavan (Lord) is the One who is the cause of our consciousness. He is the Owner, Master and the Revered One, who is Omnipotent. Therefore, depend on Him and surrender to Him. He is the One doing it and making it happen. While doing anything, offer it to Him. It is simply a minor shift in perspective. We should make the change in the way we feel [about what we do and who we are]. If this happens, it can lead you all the way!\nFor someone who has achieved 90% of the goal, striving for another 10% would see him attain it. One must not slip away now. This is what Bhagavan (Lord) wishes! If someone just began, i.e. at 1% or 2% or 3%, and slips, he would not lose much. He can make another attempt. The fact that we have this human life indicates that we rose from a lower state. We already moved past 1% or 2% and have probably made it to 96%. You probably remember the board game, ‘snakes & ladders’. In that, if you continually climb ladders, you gradually move up to spot 98, but there is a snake at 99. If you cross it, you are home at 100. However, spot 99 is where the snake is. Once you are at 97 or 98, your dice should not roll so that you land on 99! This is what we must do! Bhagavan (Lord) says, ‘To help you take that final step, I will accompany you!’ He offered that help to us. If that offer is not taken, who is at loss? We, right? No one bothers us, if we had not reached this stage with hard work. Elders are always there to help us. In fact, the purpose of all incarnations of God is to help us. There is no benefit to Him with this. He will lose nothing if you do not progress higher. Elders are similar. When they teach good learnings or share anything in scriptures... they do not do it with an expectation. Instead, they do it for our welfare. We must recognize that they strive a lot, for our benefit.\nIf you stop your karma (activity), thinking ‘What’s in it for me?’, then you will step onto spot 99 from 98. That will drop you all the way to spot 3! After reaching that high, He will help us not to slip down at the end. The goal that drove you until now, He tries to help you march on with that goal in sight. Any benefit accrued is yours, not His. Effort is yours as well, but you need support and guidance. He bestows this. This is what Bhagavan (Lord) advises in chapter 3. He says, ‘Don’t feel jealous! Do not reject my guidance, instead follow it with dedication. If you adhere to it, you will be able to overcome this last step. Recognize why you came this far. You will then be able to move ahead.’ If someone does not care for this and feels jealous, then he will revert to... one who slips while already down stays down. If he falls from top, he is no more. The injury is minor if someone slips while on ground. However, what if one falls from the top of a building? What about the one who falls from an airplane? How about the one who falls from a rocket? There is a difference, isn’t it? For the one who falls from rocket, even a speck of his ash would not be found. At least in an airplane fall, there is a chance of finding bones after he is gone. Once there was an airplane crash in Nepal or some other place. What happened then? At least a few bodies were found. What happens if they fall from even higher? For a soul, a human life is one which had risen higher than a rocket. A house fly or an insect or a germ is just a low-level life form. We worked very hard to get this [human] life. If we now strive to move further ahead, all our effort until now will turn fruitful. This is the essence of Bhagavan’s (Lord's) saying. He wants to reveal the state someone drops to, if they get arrogant and don’t heed this... by thinking, ‘Why should I care for this! I will make my own effort.’ Therefore, starting from chapter 3, verse 33, He clarifies what loss such people will experience. Let us learn this and take advantage of our life and opportunity here.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nGenerally speaking, humans are high on arrogance. They tend to feel, ‘I can do anything!’. Due to that, a human is able to wield full control of even the strongest of animals around him. With that arrogance, unfortunately, he has diminished to a state where he is scared of even a small mosquito. Though he can control some of the largest of rhinoceroses easily, a man gets frightened by a small mosquito. Why? Due to the over-confidence or excessive pride he has about himself. Perhaps it is apt to call it arrogance as opposed to pride.\nWhat happens when you harbor such feelings? Sri Krishna is firing a warning to us in chapter 3, verse 33. Today’s man commonly feels, “I can do anything! I must control this world. I must control the superiority of water and space. I should even have the authority over other planets. I should even have authority on others’ lives!” You must have heard by now, that they are manufacturing humans in certain countries. Certain countries, like China, apparently are making new humans, called ‘processed babies’. If those babies are made, normally, for us, it is difficult to wander in snowy areas. We cannot deal with big deluges or powerful tornadoes. Our behavior is conditioned to operate within the limits of the effects of nature. When those unnatural babies grow into adults and are trained as an army, they become strong and are able to wander in snow or water or anywhere. As they are growing, they do not need to be fed like us, yet they resemble humans. Apparently, this is happening, as was told to us by someone. The intent there is to exert authority on humans! A man believes he is capable of anything. He believes that everything is under his control. However, Sri Krishna elucidates in chapter 3 verse 33:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsadrusam che:shtathe: svasya:ha\nprakruthe:r jna:nava:n api |\nprakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni\nnigrahah kim karishyathi || BG 3.33\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEven a wise man acts according to his own nature. All beings follow their nature. What can repression accomplish?\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe says, “A human believes he can achieve anything and that everything is under control. That is a mistake!”\nprakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni (all beings follow their nature). This knowledgeable soul exists in Nature. This enclosure, i.e. the body, is made up of Nature, specifically of its components. Imagine a navigator undertaking space travel, we call him an astronaut. He wears a special suit. He cannot assume he can move as per his whims. The reason is that every part of the suit is equipped with different tools or instruments. They track every little movement of his and communicate it to the ground control station. They can even figure out the emotions he feels in his thoughts. They alert him then, ‘Hey! be careful. Be cool’. They warn him if he begins to think of any unrelated issues. The astronaut doesn’t have any control over himself though he thinks otherwise. Nothing! The suit can monitor every reaction and every movement right from his toe nail all the way to the tip of his hair. What can he do by himself? There is something else that is in control.\nOur body is like that too. Our body is under constant monitoring. By Whom? By the One Who made it! Who made this? The body was made with elements of Nature, by the controller of those five elements. In Bhagavad Gita, He said, ‘I am that controller!’ He made it and gave it to us. How? Each element in the body interacts with the associated trait of Nature. For example, the body contains water. It will depend on and interact with water in Nature. It is made up of tejas (energy) which will work with tejas (energy) from outside. It is also made up of earth material, so it interacts with earth as well. It is made up of air, so it needs air in the atmosphere to support itself. All of these are sadrusam che:shtathe: svasya: (behave according to their own nature).\nAlong with above, the samskaras (impressions from past actions), memories carried over from prior lives, also exist internally. He is also lugging that baggage around. The elements internal to the body interact with those external ones. These samskaras (impressions from past actions) formed due to the elements earlier, will also exhibit their influence and make a human behave accordingly. What is he doing actually? What of anything can he do at all? This is what Sri Krishna says.\nprakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni (all beings follow their nature) – every element will behave interacting with its corresponding substance of nature. When a child is at school, he behaves as per teacher’s direction. When the mother or father goes to pick him up at school and asks to leave with them, the one who was obedient to a stick wielding teacher until then, one who follows every instruction of the teacher, will quickly leave when a mother or a father or a guardian asks. Why? prakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni (all beings follow their nature). That is his source, so he goes to that source. He simply ignores everything else. Why? This body is made up of nature. It therefore behaves in accordance with nature.\n[Sri Krishna says,] ‘It is difficult for it to act as per your desires. Thinking that ‘I can control this’ is a mistake.’ When you try to control, it acts like it acquiesced. However, it will betray you when the body’s inherent ingredient of nature comes in contact with external nature. Why so? svasya:ha … prakruthe:he … sadrusam che:shtathe: (it behaves according to its own nature). It will behave as per its inherent nature, just like a dog’s tail never straightens and always follows that trait.\nIn Ramayana, Ravanasura did not believe in this and thought he could control everything. He thought he possessed everything, which turned out to be an illusion. He may not have believed it had anyone else told him that. His own wife conveyed it to him, however. When he fell on the battlefield, she dropped next to him and said, ‘Hey Ravana! indriya:ni pura: jithva: jitham tribhuvanam tvaya: (Once you had felt, ‘I controlled my senses, I won over the three realms and I am invincible!’). You are a fool. You thought you controlled senses and therefore won over the worlds. However, those senses belong to Nature and they are waiting for their turn. They waited to take vengeance on you at the right time. That time has eventually arrived today. It is just not possible for either Rama or vanaras (monkeys) to defeat you. You have an incredible strength and skill. What can a nara (human) or a vanara (monkey) do anything to that? They are merely executioners. Then, who hurt you and who killed you? The senses that you thought you won over, waited patiently for the right time. Today, they found the right opportunity, thaire:va: (by them alone). You were killed by those senses alone. It is unfortunate. You became over-confident,’ said Ravana’s wife Mandodari. This guidance is not meant for Ravana. It is for us!\nToday, leaders of powerful countries think the same way. They feel they can control everything on this earth. They think, “We even dug tunnels under the earth and established base stations there as well. Therefore, nothing happens without our knowledge”. However, things do happen occasionally here and there. Earthquakes or tsunamis or some other calamity occur and teach them an appropriate lesson. Our history shows that countries that once ruled the world, do not have a proper identity today.\nsadrusam che:shtathe: svasya:ha prakruthe:r … sadrusam (it behaves according to its own nature). One is, whatever allows us to exist in this Nature, they always behave in accordance with Nature. Second is, they are supported by karma samskaras (impressions from past actions). How many karma samskaras (impressions from past actions) are being carried now? By each individual? If we line them up in an order one by one and wrap them around the earth, there is no end to it. Every individual carries innumerable samskaras (impressions from past actions) that do not exhaust, even after laying them, one next to another, all over the earth’s surface. We are in their midst! How is it possible for us to outmaneuver them? jna:nava:n api (even if one is knowledgeable), even if one is assumed to be highly knowledgeable, he has to act according to his samskaras (impressions from past actions). nigrahah kim karishyathi (what can repression accomplish?) – One might think ‘I can control’. For how long? It is impossible. An example is Ravanasura.\nThe great emperor Bharata, who was considered highly knowledgeable, is another example. This entire land is called as Bharath, named after that great emperor Bharata. Apparently he is the reason behind this land being called Bharath. He is the great one who segregated the big land mass into continents and further into islands. He established laws of governance in them. Many proudly expanded their territory claiming they are Bharata’s descendants or relatives and referred to themselves as ‘Bharathiyans’. However, where did he end up in his final stages of life? He fulfilled all his responsibilities and decided to move into the forest to attain self-realization. He undertook an ascetic life. Then one day while bathing he saw a fawn, a baby deer, drowning in water. He felt the urge to protect it by himself. He carried the fawn with him to his hermit. He began to raise it, even spoon-feeding it. He began baby-feeding and was engrossed in its upbringing. Daily rituals such as meditation, chanting, prayer, etc. were set aside. The baby deer became his life. When the deer occasionally wandered away, he would be worried sick for its well-being. Eventually, the time to give up his body came and he died thinking of that deer. As he was consumed by feelings for the deer during the final stage, he was reborn as a deer himself. As he was an ascetic and a learned one, he lived a deer’s life with that perspective. He gave up that life eventually and then took the birth of a human. In that life, he was known as ‘Jada Bharatha’ and lived like a seer. Originally, he thought he was a knowledgeable one. However,\nprakruthe:r … sadrusam che:shtathe: (it behaves according to its own nature)\nsvasya: … prakruthe:r… sadrusam che:shtathe: (it behaves according to its own nature)\nThe samskaras (impressions from past actions) deep-rooted in one, drive him ahead. He cannot live with a misunderstanding that ‘I gained so much knowledge now’. What he gained is minuscule compared to what he has in store inside him. It is akin to mixing a fistful of sugar in an ocean! What happens if you drop a fistful of sugar into an ocean, thinking of altering the taste of its water? The sugar will simply disappear but the ocean will not have any impact. Our effort and the knowledge gained is quite similar.\nSo, what should one do? [Sri Krishna says,] “As I am the controller, Nature adheres to Me and you should too. It already exists following my guidance. However, you face issues without listening to Me. Therefore, you must listen to Me as well. mayi sannyasya (surrender to Me). You must establish a connection with Me and offer all the ownership unto Me with that feeling. Do not stop the work however! As you have this body now, you must do work. Since it belongs to Me, rest the ownership of its actions unto Me. I will ensure the acts cause neither bondage, nor burden, nor result in a loss to you.” Sri Krishna thus conveyed in chapter 3 on how a man can fulfill his duty and engage in work in the right way, without any arrogance. Beginning with verse 33, He explains about how one will incur losses if he is arrogant and the crisis he will face if he wants to ignore duty and stay apathetic. Let us learn this.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nThe essence of Bhagavad Gita is to share about … ‘What actions benefit human life? How should they be carried out?’\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the entire world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn chapter 3, Sri Krishna shared a few upadesas (teachings), by expounding on such topics. Many want to live a happy life by gaining certain knowledge without working. Nowadays it is called ‘white-collared style of life’. It means, one does not want to step into the field and spend any energy on it. He just wants to sit under a fan or an AC comfortably, without getting dirty… without spending any energy, yet wants to cash in on the good profits. It is like a software type of job. Want to enjoy profits with no physical effort put in. It is a good thing! However, one needs to possess intelligence for that. However, that might result in contracting a new illness. This is a body, isn’t it? It needs to move and walk! If one just wants to sit and use brain, then only his brain will work while the body shuts down. That will become an abode of various illnesses. It is only for the sake of the body that one wants to work and earn. It is imperative that the body is maintained. Therefore, one must use the body for work, to protect it. One must use intelligence while working with his body. Interestingly, if the work is suitable to one’s nature, then intelligence follows its lead. If one relies on intelligence alone, then the body becomes unusable. Therefore, both the body and intelligence must function well. The body is a significant one here. Even more than intelligence, the body is highly important. Only when the body exists, intelligence gets a purpose to be utilized. It is said, sari:ram adhyam khalu dharma sa:dhanam (anything of value can be achieved with the help of body alone). Hence it must be properly utilized. To be able to leverage it properly, the body must be put to work. To make the body work, one must first know the nature of work, how and why it should be done. The onus of “why” is on the intelligence, while the onus of “what” and “how” rests with body. They both should be combined. Once the body begins to work, intelligence ably supports it. A human life enables one to do this. What should be done? All responsibilities must be acted upon. How should it be done? Do it by neither assuming the ownership nor desiring results. It is easy to comprehend, yet difficult to implement. We do not want to act, if seeking results is discouraged. [Some say,] ‘Why should I do anything, if results are not desired?’ Both make one to give up work. However [Sri Krishna says,] ‘Don’t give up!’\nLet us observe the prakriti (Nature) around us. A farmer cultivates the land hoping for results, i.e. crop yield. He does not depend on the results though. If he incurred a loss once, he will continue to cultivate the land. If the crop had pest infestation, he will still cultivate it. If there was water shortage due to famine, he will work again without getting disheartened. He continues to focus hard on his work without expecting results alone. If he does his work properly, results will automatically follow. Trees bear flowers and fruits. They do not expect to gain anything by that. They do it because it is in their nature. However, they benefit others. A human life is similar. He should work thinking it is his duty. However, if he just focuses on the results and even ignores his duty – What does he risk losing from that? When only the results are desired, then work being done either gets diluted or bypassed… or there is a chance for him to traverse in a wrong path. This leads him to a spiral downward in life. Once we begin to desire the results, we will have to experience them. Then he becomes responsible for any gains or losses arising from them. If there is no desire, then he is not responsible. However, if one desires, then it is certain that he assumes the responsibility for them. What is wrong with assuming responsibility for them? How can we do everything in a perfect way? Sometimes sins are committed along the way. The first outcome of sins is owning responsibility for them. During the great churning of the ocean [by devatas (demigods) and rakshasas (demons)], the first thing that emerged was poison. Later amrutam (ambrosia), and other items emerged. Someone has to consume that poison, isn’t it? The great Lord Siva took it and protected the rest. Even in our activities, there are certainly going to be profits and losses. When we desire for their results, we must endure these profits and losses as well. Sri Krishna says, ‘If you don’t desire, I am there to protect you from those results!’ What did He ask us to do? He said, ‘Leave the results to Me, I will handle them. I will ensure these don’t bind you.’ Why? Because prakriti (Nature), does not belong to us. It won’t listen to us. However, our activities follow the traits of prakriti (Nature). He says in verse 33, prakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni (all beings follow their nature). The five elements needed to make the body are from prakriti (Nature), prakruthim ya:nthi (so they follow prakriti), so they follow prakriti (Nature). You do not have any control on prakriti (Nature). A man might incorrectly assume that prakriti (Nature) is under his control. Unfortunately, he has to bow to it, at times, when prakriti (Nature) shows its fury. Usually, it is gentle with him. It is hard to predict the effect when it gets furious.\nSri Krishna says, “Prakriti (Nature) is not independent either. It is My instrument. It follows My guidance. If you desire for prakriti (Nature) to be favorable to you, do not depend on prakriti (Nature). Instead depend on the controller of prakriti (Nature) i.e. Me! Whether you have love or devotion towards Me, don’t you desire for prakriti (Nature) to be aligned to you? That prakriti (Nature) is My subject. It follows My lead. Therefore, if you surrender to Me, I will ensure it acts in your favor. Do not keep the onus on yourself. It must be passed on to something else. Do not feel the results are due to you.” This is what we have to adhere to. We feel arrogant when doing an activity, thinking… “The activity is done by me. It is accomplished because I am doing it. Because it is done, I am entitled to success.” Such bondage with prakriti (Nature) is classified as arrogance. Karthrutva ahankara (arrogance regarding doership) gets developed. Bhoktrutva ahankara (arrogance regarding being the experiencer of results) gets developed. Seshatva ahankara (arrogance regarding ownership) gets developed. Jnatrutva ahankara (arrogance regarding knowership) gets developed. These are various ways that tie a human down. Such arrogance must diminish. What should one do then? You simply let them go. Where? In one of two places. Either on prakriti (Nature) or on Bhagavan (God), Sarvesvaranesya (the Lord of all). Bhagavan (God) says, “It is My desire that you leave them in either and not get entangled by them.” There are only those 2 options. Prakriti (Nature) has neither life nor consciousness. How can the results of an an activity be left to it? However, I am alive, conscious, all knowledgeable, omniscient and also your owner. Therefore, it is convenient for you to leave that to Me! It will be difficult to choose prakriti (Nature). The reason is – as I alluded to earlier, prakriti (Nature) is like a big water surge. It is like an ocean. Whether you try to mix a little salt or sugar in the ocean, it dissolves fully and has no impact. Similarly, your behavior and intelligence cannot develop enough to alter the effect of nature.\nImagine a person traveling in a train. The train is an unconscious entity while he is a conscious one, however the train doesn’t move because he demands it. There is someone sitting in the engine. It moves by his act. Take the example of airplanes. They are not conscious either. Each traveler is conscious and an intelligent one. But they don’t fly because of him. They don’t fly because he wishes for it. They fly because of the pilot operating it. However, not even that pilot is in full control. Lately, there is something called auto-pilot. Someone in the auto-pilot system operates it. The pilot is just a namesake sitting in the cabin, maybe just to do a limited set of operations. Perhaps in a few days, trains may also follow this approach. They may also use auto-pilot with the operator running it from somewhere else. A traveler cannot affect any change to it and will have to endure its impact. If he dares to achieve something and opens its door enroute, it is a danger to his life. Its speed and strength are large, while his speed and strength are minimal. Therefore, his act can neither impact the other nor control it in any way. He is a weakling in comparison, while its strength continues to increase. Though it is lifeless, it grows much stronger. Prakriti (Nature) is also like that. Train or an airplane or a rocket are all just small visual examples. Prakriti (Nature) is much stronger than millions of trains or airplanes or rockets. It is foolish to imagine curtailing its impact by yourself. So, what should one do? Sri Krishna says, “Trust Me! I am the One who gave the strength to prakriti (Nature). I gave this knowledge to you. Isn’t it sufficient for you to depend on Me? If you surrender to Me, then you can interact with prakriti (Nature) in whichever way you like. An eagle and a snake always despise one another. The reason - upon seeing a snake, the eagle tries to kill it. Similarly, the snake slithers away on seeing an eagle. When does this happen? When they think they control everything. Imagine if any of them is under the shelter of a powerful man.\nNichashrayo na kartavyaha kartavyo mahadasrayaha (one should not seek shelter in the lowly; one should seek shelter in the great). It just needs to seek a powerful man’s shelter. One day it actually sought a great being. Who did it seek? Isasrayo mahanagaha paiprachcha garudam sukham (the great snake, having taken shelter in Ishvara (Lord Siva), asked Garuda about his well-being). The snake ended up seeking Lord Siva and became His neck ornament. What happened then? As you know, Lord Vishnu and Lord Siva are friends. They visit each other and socialize occasionally. Once Lord Siva came over to meet Lord Vishnu, so He too approached to greet Lord Siva. Lord Vishnu was mounted on Garuda while Lord Siva had the snake around His neck. While they were chatting, the snake on Lord Siva’s neck said… “Hey Garuda! How are you? How are things with you?” It now began to speak to Garuda! Why? Now it feels brave and isn’t threatened by Garuda. Sri Krishna emphasizes, “Due to mahadasraya (shelter in a great being), the way the snake behaves bravely… When you take shelter in Me, I will ensure prakriti (Nature) does not bring any catastrophe upon you.” Look, how nice this [assurance] is! Therefore, do your work. While operating within prakriti (Nature), place the responsibility on Me. I will ensure it doesn’t bind you in anyway. Instead, if you feel, ‘I can do this by myself. Why should I depend on You? Do you take me as incapable one?’ Then one becomes fraught with danger.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsadrusam che:shtathe: svasya:ha\nprakruthe:r jna:nava:n api |\nprakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni\nnigrahah kim karishyathi || BG 3.33\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEven a wise man acts according to his own nature.

Irrespective of how learned you are, prakriti (Nature) can overwhelm you.” Bhagavan (God) is thus establishing in verse 3.33, the dedication and submission a karma-bound soul must have.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIn the beginning of Bhagavad Gita...\nWhat is the capability level of a human being? What is the level of effect or influence of Nature [on him]? Of these two, which one is more powerful? Bhagavan (Lord) tries to weigh and compare the two from verse 3.33 onwards for a few verses. At the outset He says, `nigrahah kim karishyathi (what will control achieve?)`. `jnanavan api (even a knowledgeable person)`. Irrespective of how intelligent or knowledgeable one is, how does his resolve hold up?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\napadām apahartāraṃ dātāraṃ sarva sampadām\nlokābhirāmaṃ śrīrāmaṃ bhūyo bhūyo namāmyaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere are two concepts, logic and practice. Logic indicates use of intelligence while practice relates to the body. Which of these is stronger? Is it logic or practice? Practice is considered stronger. Practice has the ability to draw logic towards itself. That is, the body has that ability. We see this in many instances manifesting in various ways. Sri Krishna taught this in 3.33…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprakṛtiṃ yānti bhūtāni\nnigrahaḥ kiṃ kariṣyati\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll beings follow their nature; what will restraint achieve?\n-----------------------------------------------\n“I can do anything independently.” and… “I have all the required knowledge and intelligence to do so.” Bhagavan (Lord) is asking a question to a person who thinks that way. He explained it with an example. He says, “Whenever one faces a problem, a man chooses a path that suits his body. Not the one that helps in self-realization. Everyone behaves in the same way.”\nWe all know that Lord Rama is a great One, knowledgeable and intelligent! He is also known as, `jita krodhaha (one who has conquered anger)`. It doesn’t mean that He never gets angry. Of all the ways to showcase knowledge, anger is utilized in one such way. Everyone gets angry. However, one must keep it under his control. Rama had this control. Though He gets angry, it acts as per His discretion. During the war, once Hanuman gets hurt - Rama can’t bear to see that. Sage Valmiki says, to anger… `aharayat tivram kopasya vasa me ivan (He summoned intense anger and told it to possess Him briefly)`. ‘He summoned anger and told it to possess Him briefly so He could leverage it to attack the enemy.’ Without anger it is hard to be effective [in that instance]. Anger is needed here. He summoned anger and made it possess Him, so He could use it in the situation. After He was done with it, Rama commands it to go away as its use is done. Someone going out in cold weather would wear a coat, finish his work and return it to the coat hanger as before. Similarly, Ramayana depicts that Rama as the One who can wield anger. He is also a human. The main purpose of Sri Rama Avatar (incarnation) was to portray the state of a human.\nRama is revered as God by many. There’s nothing wrong with that. When we pray to God, we feel ‘He is God. He is capable of anything. However, we are humans. What can we achieve? Therefore, achieving anything wouldn’t work out for us. We cannot follow all the norms well. How can we do it?” We tend to make such excuses. We find ways to dodge around situations. When Rama was a human, think of the hardships and problems He faced. Given that, yet as a man, despite so many issues, he withstood and dealt with them… He became a source of inspiration for the rest of us. Now, there is a chance that others would think, ‘Our challenges compared with Rama’s are miniscule! We should also bear them. We should also behave without violating the norms.’ For that reason, Sri Rama always claimed to be a human and never considered Himself to be a God. `atmanam manusham manye (I consider myself a human)`. I consider myself a human, so will live like one. He never acted as a God nor depicted divinity. Because He was able to exist as a 100% human and the best model human being at that… …we try to draw inspiration from Him by building temples and monuments… …so we can approach Him to pray and be able to tread the path He has shown to fulfill our needs. At least some, who choose to, are able to follow.\nThere are others who disrespect and abuse Him. While disrespecting, they are remembering Him. In a way, that is also good. While maligning Him, they are continuously contemplating on Him. They speak about Sri Rama, Ramayanam and His qualities. Whether to abuse or extol Him, we need to speak of His qualities as they are important for anything. In Thiruppavai, Goda Devi claims that His qualities are extraordinary. She says, `kirthimai padi poi (qualities that can be extolled)` are paramount for anyone.\nIn reality Rama tremendously respects Mother Kaikeyi. Once in the forest, after Mother Sita was abducted by Ravana and they go in search after Her… Lakshmana thinks that remembering Bharatha would console Rama. As He was heading for a bath, he says… `kathannu apara ratreshu sarayum avagahyate (how does he bathe in the Sarayu in the late hours of the night?)`. “In this cold winter, during the wee hours with no sight of the warm sun… poor Bharatha is struggling to venture out in the dark night for a cold bath in River Sarayu.” He thought by bringing up Bharatha, Rama would feel better. While speaking about him, Lakshmana continued, ‘Bharatha is enduring many hardships and so are we! Why are we in this situation? Isn’t it all because of Mother Kaikeyi?’ He diverted the conversation to Mother Kaikeyi which Rama wasn’t pleased with. He said, `nathe yemba madhyama garhitavyat kadachana (never speak ill of the middle mother)`. He admonished Lakshmana, “Do not say anything bad about Mother Kaikeyi!’ He never hated her and did not like others attacking her. In His mind, He only had respect for her and was even thankful to her later. He felt later, “Only because of her, I could come to the forest and later could serve rishis (sages). Due to being in forest, I could serve Sabari. Later I could help Sugriva and then ‘gain’ Hanuman. Because I came to the forest, I could kill many rakshasas (demons).” The reason He was able to do many such activities is because she forced Him into exile. The rishis (sages) faced many hardships under His father’s governance and were ignored. It was because of her now that He was able to protect their efforts of hard work. Sri Ramachandra had an enormous amount of gratitude. Ramayana speaks of ten ways that Rama was thankful to her! He always remembered Mother Kaikeyi. In fact, Rama’s affection to Bharatha stemmed from him being Kaikeyi’s son. Post-war, Rama says to Vibhishana, `tam vinat kaikeyi putram (without Kaikeyi's son...)` when urging him to prepare the Pushpaka Vimana (celestial chariot) quickly. These depict Rama’s dedication, devotion, and affection towards Mother Kaikeyi.\nHowever, does Rama hold any anger on Mother Kaikeyi or not? Though Rama, as a human, demonstrated his gratitude to her, He also had a typical human weakness. Once when He was not in control, one could see His anger for her. In certain instances, our real nature shows through. We call that practice; other things are logic. Logic dictates how one must be. Following that, a man always behaves well. However, sometimes the natural behavior [comes out inadvertently] … In verse 33, Lord Krishna questions, `prakrutim yanti bhutani nigrahaha kim karishyathi (all beings follow their nature; what will restraint achieve?)`. What happens to the one who thinks he is under control? Sri Krishna says, “Prakruthi (Nature), will pull him down. Beware!” We observe this in Rama’s life too.\nWhen He lost Mother Sita, after Ravana abducted Her, He began searching for Her but She was nowhere to be found. He searched for Her in mountains, hills, ravines, and rivers thinking that She might have gone there. Eventually he gave in to His anger. In that fit, He says, `karishye maithili hetoho apishacham arakshasam (for Sita's sake, I will make the world free of demons and rakshasas)`. He began to set an arrow on his bow saying, “I will kill every Rakshasa (demon) on the face of this earth.” Lakshmana asked what is He planning to do? Rama says, `nashayami Jagat sarvam (I will destroy the entire world)`, `Trailokyam sacharacharam (the three worlds with all their moving and non-moving beings)`. “I will destroy every being out there!” Lakshmana got scared. As he was Ramanuja (Rama's younger brother), he must control Rama. He said, “It’s not right to punish everyone for an individual’s mistake. `deva gandharva lokanscha vicheshyama samahitaha (we will search diligently in the worlds of gods and gandharvas)`, Let us search more, however long we can, we will search. `yavannadi gamishyama ha, tava bharyapaharinam (we will go until we find your wife's abductor)`. We will search until we find your wife’s abductor. Today your anger got the better of you. `kopasya vasa mapannaha prakrutim hatu marhasi (having fallen under the sway of anger, you should abandon this nature)`. Please control your behavior. Control yourself. `ekasya na paradhena lokam hantum tu marhasi (it is not right to kill the world for the fault of one)`. Since Rama was wise, He quickly became aware of the grave situation and controlled His anger. `sara grahi maha saram prati jagraha raghavaha (Rama, the great one who grasps the essence, accepted the profound advice)`. Rama managed this with His intelligence.\nHowever, a thought crossed His mind. What is it? ‘Today in the forest, the time that Kaikeyi had wished for, arrived!’ Why? “Someone abducted Mother Sita now. We do not know who. I cannot survive without her. Then, there is no chance of Me returning after 14 years of exile. Due to which, her desire of Bharatha assuming the throne will be fulfilled. He can become the King now. `kachit sakama sukhita kaikeyi sa bhavishyati (Kaikeyi will surely be happy and fulfilled in her desires)`. Her desire will be fulfilled and she can live happily. `Sita nimittam soumitre mruthemai gathetvai (if I die for Sita's sake, Lakshmana, you will be forced to return)`. When I die, you will be forced to return. She will be content with her desire fulfilled.” This is the effect of Prakruthi (Nature)! The emotion, anger, is natural for anyone. Since He is wise, He is able to control it. However, how many can act like Rama?\nSri Krishna says, “Hey Arjuna! It is incorrect to assume ‘I own myself… and can control the impact of everything. I will also become wise.’” What should be done then? You have two options. One is Prakruthi (Nature). The other is Me. Prakruthi (Nature) has no consciousness yet powerful like a train, plane or an ocean. Your acquired knowledge is like a pinch of salt or handful of sugar that gets dissolved in the ocean. It is not effective. It is not enough for handling the effect [of Prakruthi (Nature)]. It is neither independent nor intelligent. Know that both you and Prakruthi (Nature) operate under My influence. Therefore, put your trust in Me. In verse 30, He says, `mayi sannyasya (surrendering to Me)`… Put your trust in Me, then I will ensure this Prakruthi (Nature) aids in your effort. I am the One who can influence it in that way. I am also the One who makes you function. You are carrying many samskaras (impressions from past actions) [from earlier lives]. They are influencing your path now. Prakruthi (Nature) has a certain effect on you, as do your vasanas (latent tendencies). Both put you under Prakruthi’s (Nature's) influence. Therefore, if you put your trust in Me, then every act rendered becomes My service. Do not quit your work, do not ignore the result either. However, if you can transform every act as service to Me, you gain two benefits. One is, I will ensure it [Prakruthi (Nature)] does not overpower you. Second, all the prior vasanas (latent tendencies) that are destined to impact you, will be eliminated by Me. You will get both benefits, by transforming your duty. If you can adjust your mindset a little. I‘ll bestow a unique strength where you can nullify the effect of Prakruthi (Nature) now as well as eliminate prior vasanas (latent tendencies). The snake that surrendered to Lord Shiva, was able to garner strength to speak to Garuda. Similarly, I will make you stronger. “You cannot afford to ignore Me.” Sri Krishna is thus questioning and alerting us in verse 33, `nigrahah kim karishyathi (what will control achieve?)`!\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nWishes to everyone on the occasion of Indian Republic Day! This year is unique as the country is celebrating 75 years of Independence. Being a Republic means possessing the ability to self-govern. However, the question is, are we really governing ourselves? Trusting that a few will help in self-governing, we choose them via elections. If the chosen one turns out to be inadequate, that will lead to many bad situations. Instead, if the chosen one is capable, the citizens can hold their head high with pride. This we need to remember! If in the eyes of the world we are able to hold our head high and can proudly claim our identity, then that state is prosperous. What is that state?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAgain and again, I bow to Lord Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all prosperity, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nLord Krishna in chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita says, `mayi sannyasya` (surrender to Me). He said, “Choose Me. Cast your vote for Me!” What should we do? There are only 2 options. One is Me and the other is `prakruthi` (nature). If you choose `prakruthi` (nature), then you would fall so far down that there is no point of return. The country has endured this for the past 70 years. On the other hand, if you surrender to Sri Krishna, He says, “I will bestow enough strength for you to feel proud of your identity anywhere in the world!” Anyone who felt they didn't need help and could self-manage, could not sustain themselves. This we must remember.\nSri Krishna’s question to us in 3.33 was, `nigrahah kim karishyathi?` (what will restraint do?). `prakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni` (beings follow their nature). It is unavoidable for anyone. We all are aware of Sage Vishwamitra’s story. He thought, ‘I should attain it by myself. I must command this `prakruthi` (nature).’ He put his trust neither on `Bhagava:n` (the Lord), nor on Elders. He felt very competent. Consequently, he traveled to different directions to do `thapas` (penance). First, he gained expertise in the skill of archery. He became very powerful. He tried to leverage it. However, each endeavor he made, in every direction, resulted in failure. He experimented in South, West and North directions. He encountered a different catastrophe in every direction. There, he faced either Menaka, or Sunasvepa, or Thrisanku. Every time, he managed to squander his penance-power in a different way. Since he was wise, he eventually took heed of `de:vatha:s` (deities). He sought blessings from Sage Vasishta and reached the state of `Bramha Rishi` (Brahmin sage). His efforts proved inadequate and he could only attain it with the blessings of Elders. He could overcome it once he realized their value. He could only taste failure when he misjudged his own ability or desired to command `prakruthi` (nature). Once he obtained Sage Vasishta’s grace, he even rose to the stature of guiding Lord Sri Rama! He could make Rama his devotee and his disciple. This story of Sage Vishwamitra is well known.\nSome like to sit alone somewhere to meditate. Either on a mat, in an `a:sana` (posture), or in an open ground, or on grass somewhere. Their intent is to sit idle and concentrate. However, they get distracted and use their hands to pluck or scratch or dig up something. They do not do this consciously. `prakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni` (beings follow their nature) - their instincts drive them to act that way. We know we are not supposed to eat certain items. However, `prakruthi` (nature) degrades one to the point where he can’t resist. That is how a human gets ruined. Isn’t it?\nOnce a couple of creatures were getting washed away in a river flood. One was a scorpion and the other a bird. The scorpion sought help from the bird, ‘Could you please support me? I need to reach the shore. I am getting washed away and am about to die.’ The bird said, ‘Will you not sting me if I pull you out?’ The scorpion said, ‘You and I are both in danger. We both need to come out of it. You can help here. Why would I sting you? It is also risky for me.’ The bird agreed and allowed the scorpion to climb on top of him. As soon as the bird flew a short distance, the scorpion immediately grabbed the bird’s neck. Its instincts, caused by `prakruthi` (nature) made it grab the bird’s neck. That is his natural behavior. The bird asked, “Why are you stinging me?” The scorpion said, “What can I do? It is my nature.” `svabha:vo durathikramaha` (one's nature is difficult to overcome), `it is my nature’ prakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni` (beings follow their nature).\nOnce a man traveled to Ka:si and Gaya (pilgrimage cities in India). The tradition there is to give up something that one desires. He liked jackfruit, so he committed there to give up jackfruit. However, internally he had cultivated a habit driven by `prakruthi` (nature), and had a desire for jackfruit. Now it had been a while since he resolved to give it up. Once he traveled to his relatives' area. He came across jackfruit being sold in the market. The relatives thought about buying it. During the purchase, he was right next to them, watching. He then says to them, ‘Don’t buy those. These are better and delicious. Not those.’ Why should he bother about the fruit? It is because of `prakruthi` (nature), the inner instincts stimulated him. `sadrusam che:shtathe: svasya:ha prakruthe:he` (everyone acts according to their own nature). Though a human is aware of the facts, the accumulated `karmas` (actions/deeds) from previous lives compel him on his chosen path. He gets washed away in its flow, if he chooses the option of `prakruthi` (nature).\nSri Krishna says in chapter 3, ‘`mayi sannyasya` (surrender to Me) – [Instead,] take My support. I will ensure nothing untoward befalls you.’ If you rely on Him, He will control you as well as `prakruthi` (nature). He will help eliminate `va:sana:s` (inner tendencies/desires). What should be offered to Him? `sarva karma:ni` (offer all work done to Him). Your resolve is immaterial. Anyone born as a human has no choice but to submit to `prakruthi` (nature). If one wants to restrain `prakruthi` (nature), it won’t excuse him. What should we do then? Just like how sage Vishwamitra relied on his `guru` (spiritual teacher), Sage Vasishta, we must rely on Him, Who is the universal `guru` (spiritual teacher). It is prosperous for us to depend on Him and trust Him. It is imperative to recognize that He guides us. We must renounce the feeling, ‘I am doing it’, or ‘I am solely responsible’, or ‘it is for my benefit’. Then `karma` (action/deed) gets vanquished and will have no effect on us. Acquired knowledge also aids the `karma` (action/deed) and you get liberated. As He knows the dire effects of `prakruthi’s` (nature's) influence, the great Sri Krishna is advising thus. For anyone, the effects of `prakruthi` (nature) are dire.\nOnce, a brute hunter, following the advice of a learned one, changed his occupation, became a saint and began penance. Another hunter approached in search of a turtle. He kept on trying to aim for it and catch it. Though he caught it, he couldn’t hurt it however hard he hit on its shell. Seeing this, the first one who was a hunter himself earlier, suggested, “Why do you hit it like that? Striking its shell won’t cause any damage. You must flip it and simply poke the bottom. That’s all.” He spoke because his inner `va:sana` (inner tendency) acted up, stimulated by `prakruthi` (nature). It is buried in deep layers within him. Freshly made `va:sanas` (inner tendencies) are at a superficial level. However, some are deeply embedded inside. Where is the need for the first hunter to speak up? It was not necessary. However, the `ruchis` (inclinations) and `va:sana:s` (inner tendencies) situated inside tend to pop up occasionally. If he depends entirely on himself, they show their effect on him. With arrogance, if he feels he can achieve everything by himself, Sri Krishna says, “It is not advisable. You must put your trust on Me. I‘ll bear the responsibility. I‘ll make sure `prakruthi` (nature) neither causes any catastrophe nor impedes you in anyway.”\nHowever, we are humans. A human naturally has certain faults. As a child, we used to hear a story from Panchatantra. Once a man was roaming in a forest. He suddenly hears the roar of a tiger from behind. He got scared. He immediately ran and climbed a nearby tree. He felt safe then. When he looked up, he saw a bear above him perched on top of the tree. Underneath, there is a wild tiger, whereas above, there’s a bear. He was horrified. He didn’t know what to do. The bear had also gone up the tree, as it was scared of the tiger. Time passed and night descended on the forest. Both the man and the bear felt sleepy. As they are wild animals, they are used to roaming around at night. He began to wonder how to get out of this predicament. Then the bear spoke. “Hey man! Do not worry. We both are in the same situation. We are scared and must protect ourselves from this danger. Therefore, you sleep first and I will keep the watch for us. Later you keep watch while I rest. Let us take turns until the tiger leaves. After it leaves, we can go our separate ways.” Agreeing to that, the man slept first. The bear kept an eye on the danger below. Meanwhile, the tiger below stated, “He is a man. He means danger to us. He will kill you later. Therefore, push him down. I‘ll devour him and leave.” Then the bear said, “I do not commit such heinous acts. No, it is not right to cheat one that trusts us.” The tiger from underneath tried hard to convince. Nothing worked. After some time the man woke up. Since the bear too was sleepy, he asked it to rest and promised to keep the watch. Some time later, the tiger tried again with the man, “Hey, the bear too is a wild animal. Even if I spare you, it won’t. It will attack and kill you later. Therefore, for your safety, push it down. I‘ll eat it and leave. You will be safe then.” He is a human, isn’t it? He is arrogant. His thoughts run wild. The tiger’s words worked on him. He tried to push the bear down from the tree. The bear while sleeping usually holds onto a branch. It woke up. As it was holding onto a branch, it didn’t fall. It stabilized itself quickly. The man was terrified. He didn’t know what to do. Then the bear said, “O fool and an ungrateful one! I saved you and did not push you when you were sleeping. You are not thankful for it. Yet, I will neither sacrifice you nor hurt you. You live as per your whims.” The bear thus established the untrustworthy nature of human. It waited until it was safe and left, saying that it is a sin to even kill such a being. That is how a man is. He is an arrogant one! Hence a man must be taught several times, repeatedly.\nEarlier we alluded that a human life is like the 98th step of a 100-step journey. Another 2 steps will put him in a state of liberation. Sri Krishna’s endeavor is to help man attain it. That is also the essence of Upanishads. Sages also resolved to help us. That is why `Bhagava:n` (the Lord) patiently and in multitude of ways tried to elucidate in a detailed way. To safeguard a man, He asked to put `karthruthvam` (doership) on Him, so `prakruthi` (nature) has no impact. He is trying to make us realize this. The essence of His teaching is, “Do not be arrogant that you can do everything by yourself!” He explained in verse 3.33 of the risk of assuming the ownership of an activity or falsely thinking that one can achieve anything because he is the most intelligent! `Bhagava:n` (the Lord) is moving ahead trying to clarify how perilous this risk is.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nThe aim of Bhagavad Gita is to teach how to understand various challenges faced in human life. How to come up with suitable solutions and implement or practice them. In addition, the goal of Bhagavad Gita is also to educate a human of the activities he must do to ensure the soul on departing does not take another birth. While we are alive in this body, we must recognize the problems or challenges caused by the things or people or Nature around us. We must also understand their nature, why we experience them and how to overcome these.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and is the delight of the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKrishna’s aim is to share this knowledge in the first six chapters [of Bhagavad Gita]. If we are able to understand that and meticulously follow, then we have a chance to attain Him. The aim is to share how a body that is made up of components of *prakruthi* (nature) itself, and the soul within, navigate the impact of *prakruthi* (nature) on them. We are aware of the impact to some extent already. We know what we should avoid. Yet, we lean in to that undesired behavior. Sometimes we do it either knowingly or unknowingly.\nWe know we should not chew on our nails. It is unhealthy. We know there is dirt underneath them. Whether dirt exists or not, the nails or even our hair is a waste extract of the body and bones. We know this is a wrong practice. Whether one is literate or not, youth or adult, as soon as he sits to relax, he begins to chew his nails, and makes it look fashionable. Do they not know it is wrong? They do. Why is it happening then? Why do they resort to chewing? Even our hair is a waste extract from the body. We know it should not be played with. Hands must be washed immediately if you do. At least, the one that believes it is dirty, will wash his hands. However, the hand keeps making its way to the mouth automatically. Some, even while doing divine activities, like taking *thi:rtham* (holy water) or doing *a:chamanam* (ritual sipping of water), they take a sip and wipe the wet hand on their head. They take another sip, another wipe. Some even guide them to do that! They say, “It is very pious. Wipe it on your head, do it”. In reality, it is not right. Yet it has become a habit. Unfortunately, it has become our nature due to the instinct from within. Why is this happening?\nThere are many such deviations happening in varied forms. We sit to be idle and meditate. Though we know it is not right, we slowly start to pluck grass next to us and make a heap. We see heaps of grass after people sit in one place. We know we should not vandalize others’ walls with graffiti. In fact, there is no need to write on walls. However, some cannot control themselves. As soon as they sit by the wall, they scribble on it with a pen. If they see a white surface anywhere, they scribble ‘garbage’ on it. We observe this. It is due to the instinct coming from within. Krishna is revealing the root cause for this, in chapter 3. “This is due to the effect of *prakruthi* (nature). You assume you can manage its impact by yourself”.\n`nigrahah kim karishyathi … prakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni` (what will restraint do? … beings follow their nature)\n*Prakruthi* (nature), Nature that is within, stimulates one continuously. One operates within the confines of *prakruthi* (nature). It moves him with a certain force and speed. Even if one resolves to be unaffected, he can only maintain that for a short period of time. How long can he hold off?\nThere is a short story in Mahabharata. Indra, the leader of *de:vatha:s* (deities), decided to cultivate the Kha:ndava Forest. That forest provided amazing, flat and fertile land. He brought a good, growable set of seedlings there and decided to plant them. Though he decided on a specific day by himself, Indra checked with his *guru* (teacher) if the chosen day is auspicious and if he should plant the seedlings on that day. It would have been better if he had carried on without checking with his *guru* (teacher). Now that he asked, the *guru* (teacher) began checking *panchamgam* (Vedic calendar). He said, “That day and time are not auspicious. It doesn’t bode well for you.” Indra questioned, “Why is it not good? The planets are mis-aligned, right? Those very planets are my servants anyway. They are obligated to follow my decree. Therefore, let’s position those specific planets such that the day and time turns auspicious for me!” Then he ensured the planets were positioned in exactly the place he wanted them to be. You must have observed the deities of *nava grahas* (nine planets). They face away from one another. When one faces one side, others turn a different direction. He felt if they face each other, they might signal one another and alter their positions, which would undermine the initiative he undertook. So, he thought to position them in such a way that they cannot influence one another. He ordered accordingly. His *guru* (teacher) had already conveyed that the day does not bode well for him. Still, he felt they are his planets and are his employees. He moved them as he felt they must listen to him. He planted the seedlings on the designated day. He did a ‘clean & green’ project. Then Indra ordered the *de:vatha* (deity) of rain for rainfall, which he obliged. Eventually the plants grew and became an abundantly full forest. Everywhere there were lush trees with honey-laden flowers and fruits. Several creatures made it their home. Many plants, animals, birds and a variety of snakes began to survive there. They all found shelter in that forest.\nOne day, Yudhishtir [the eldest Pandava brother] performed *ra:jasu:ya yajna* (royal consecration ritual). Agni Deva (the Fire deity), flaming in the *yajna pit* (ritual fire pit), should be able to digest any quantity of *ghee* (clarified butter) offered to him. He could not digest it all and faced a situation of *a:ma do:sha* (indigestion). He thus began to suffer. Generally the *yajna pit* (ritual fire pit) is used to do this *ho:mam* (fire ritual), the *yajna* (ritual). A mixture called *sa:kalyam* (mixture of ingredients) made of several ingredients like sesame, rice other seeds and substances is prepared. It is mixed with *ghee* (clarified butter) and offered. They must all be incinerated. That is called *pachanam* (digested). Any offering to Agni Deva (the Fire deity) must become *pachanam* (digested). None should be left in the end. However, in recent times, priests simply fill up the pit in the end by dumping everything into it. Then they claim that the *pu:rna:huthi* (final offering) is complete and extinguish the fire. By chanting the *pruthvi: sa:nthi manthra* (earth peace mantra), they douse the fire entirely. However, some substances offered are still raw and did not incinerate. They did not become *pachanam* (digested), ‘digested’ by fire. This leads to indigestion for Agni Deva (the Fire deity). What happens if consumed food does not get digested? It leads to indigestion, doesn’t it? Similarly, that day of *ra:jasu:ya yajna* (royal consecration ritual) caused indigestion to Agni Deva (the Fire deity).\nWhat should be done now? He consulted many. Ashwini De:vathas (Ashwini deities) are the consulting doctors for *de:vathas* (deities). He enquired with them. To help with digestion, they advised him to burn something that is thickly grown and lush. Agni Deva (the Fire deity) then scanned everywhere for such an abundantly grown area. He came across that very Kha:ndava Vanam (Kha:ndava Forest). It was endowed with amazing plants and trees that have medicinal qualities about them. That is what he wanted as well. Therefore, he needed to set that Kha:ndava Vanam (Kha:ndava Forest) ablaze. However, it was planted by Indra who happened to be his boss. That forest was seeded by Indra. If Agni Deva (the Fire deity) burns it down, he will be ousted from his job. What must he do now? He wanted to be a good employee, yet Agni Deva (the Fire deity) was unable to bear the pain of indigestion. After thinking deeply, he came up with an idea. Since Arjuna was born with Indra’s grace, he decided to approach Arjuna for help. He asked, ‘Hey Arjuna! I have severe indigestion. Do you have any idea to help?’ Arjuna said, ‘What can I do for you? What do you need?’ Agni said, ‘I need to consume Kha:ndava Vanam (Kha:ndava Forest), however it belongs to Indra. It is risky for me to do it, unless you offer protection for me.’ As Krishna is his brother-in-law and knowing he has His support, Arjuna said, “You will have no problem. Come on, go ahead.” Agni asked, “What if Indra tries to attack me later?” Arjuna responded, “I will take care of it. Even if he orders the rain *de:vatha* (deity) to drench the area, I‘ll build a canopy with arrows and ensure not a single drop affects you. Just go ahead!” In fact, Arjuna fulfilled his vow to Agni. Indra got upset and ordered a big downpour, yet the forest got burned anyway. Agni was extremely thrilled afterwards and presented an amazing bow called Gandivam and a chariot to Arjuna. He gifted a conch to Krishna for aiding Arjuna. The conch he gave to Arjuna is called Devadattam. Krishna’s conch is called Panchajanyam and the chariot is called Nandaghosham. He gave all these to them.\nNow Indra was feeling tense. He felt, “Though I arranged for perfect planetary alignment, why did the forest get burned?” He went and asked his *Guru* (teacher) the same. Why should he consult *Guru* (teacher) now, when he ignored the same *guru’s* (teacher's) advice earlier? Still, he went and sought clarification. Even his *Guru* (teacher) was surprised. “You did align the planets, however, what happened?” Then, with divine vision, his *Guru* (teacher) saw the reason. Indra did ask the planets to assume appropriate places. However, shortly before the said auspicious time, the planets don’t face each other and stand in their own directions. Apparently, the planet *Sani* (Saturn), has a limp. How long can he stand? If it was in his designated place, he would have had some support. But this was not his place and he was hurriedly placed here. He slipped and fell on the planet behind him, who in turn fell on the planet behind him, and this cascaded to other planets. Exactly at the time Indra was planting the seedlings, all the planets moved and fell into their original positions where they were supposed to be to begin with. Indra finished planting the way he wanted to at that ‘auspicious’ time. Then the planets quickly re-adjusted and came back to their places that Indra had assigned. Later Indra came to check on the planets. They were all holding their assigned positions. They all stood up to show him and Indra thought the task was accomplished.\nVisualizing this, the *Guru* (teacher) said, ‘Hey Indra! No one can alter the natural order of things. You assumed they are your servants. No! You and they are all the subjects of the Supreme *Bhagava:n* (Lord). *Bhagava:n* (Lord) set this order. You should only become the enabler of that order. You are just an executive officer but not a policy maker. You thought you are the policy maker, which is incorrect! Your responsibility is to protect the order with the authority given to you using the suggested tools. You should not deviate.\n`prakruthim ya:nthi bhu:tha:ni` (beings move according to the given direction)\n`nigrahah kim karishyathi` (it’s impossible to alter it in anyway my friend)\nHis *guru* (teacher) advises him accordingly as per the anecdote. Krishna was discussing the same in Bhagavad Gita 3.33. [Arjuna asked] Why do the senses have their own nature? Though we try to change them, why do they revert to their original nature, like a dog’s twisted tail? Krishna offers to answer this quandary by moving us ahead into 3.34. Let’s learn.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n    In Bhagavad Gita, God teaches everyone what they need. However, He proclaims that the primary goal for every being is to attain ‘Him’. Prior to attaining ‘Him’, there is realization of atma (soul). Soul refers to ourselves. Meaning, we must realize who we are. Realizing who we are, is termed as atma sakshatkara (self-realization). This is one goal. Bhagavad sakshatkara (God realization), is another goal. Prior to self-realization, [there is a step]. We can only realize who we are after we take control of ourselves.\n    What does it mean to take control of ourselves? It is to make sure the tools around us are following our instructions. What tools do we have? There are… Buddhi (intellect), Manas (mind), Indriyas (senses), Sharira (body). We should try to have control over these. Are these in control? None of these are in control! The body is not following our instructions. The senses are not following our instructions. The mind is not following our instructions. The intellect is not following our instructions to begin with.\n    Regardless of one’s status, everyone seems to talk differently based on what position they are. A person talks differently after he is appointed to a position compared to prior that. He talks one way on assuming his post and changes after some stability. He talks one way while working and a different way after his work is complete. He talks one way until he gets what he wants. He talks another way if he doesn’t get what he wants. His talk changes after he gets what he wants. We are a witness to all of these in the world. Why is this and what is the reason for these kinds of things to be happening? How can we bring these in order? How can we bring rujutva (order), to this? Consequently, how can we try for self-realization? Or how can we try for God-realization?\n    Self-realization or God-realization are for later. Firstly, you should live a peaceful life here. You should have a smooth life. You should lead a victorious life. Isn’t it? Even for that, you need rujutva (order). You should put your body, senses, mind and intellect in order. What should you do to put them in order? This is what He is talking about. If we depend on Him for this, He says He will support and make the effort simpler for us. Will everyone agree to this? There will be people who turn against God and ‘raise a knife’ on Him! “We can achieve what we want and we have all kinds of power.” “We have achieved everything.” There are some who think this way. It’s essential to warn people of such a nature on what could lead to. If they can achieve it in the process, that’s the greatest thing they can do. That’s fine and He also feels happy. However, they do not know how difficult the task is! So, God feels responsible to let them know. That’s why, to control them on your own… “Do you even know what is diverting you?” We don’t know. He explains it.\n    Firstly, don’t succumb to raga (attraction) and dvesha (aversion). Learn to be above raga (attraction) and dvesha (aversion). Don’t go overboard and take something so close to heart. Don’t hate something without reason. Don’t hate something and push it away. You shouldn’t do both.\n    thayo:rna vasama:gacche:th (Do not come under their control)\n    What is the reason?\n    thouhi asya paripandhinow (They are one’s enemies)\n    indriyasya indriyasya:rtthe: (With senses being the base, we behave as per them…)\n    They work with their respective attributes. Hence, what should you do? You must first have a goal. You should keep moving towards that goal as much as possible and move ahead. You can control these enemies to an extent. You can stay away from their pangs. Otherwise, they will continue to keep dragging you. “Come on, come on.” If you are fixed on your set goal, you will know which direction to go. You can make way for it. Is this possible? Having set a goal, is it possible to escape from them? Yeah! Does that mean we stop following our tendencies? No need! While the tendencies continue, you should not be focused on them. You must definitely focus on something else.\n    Earlier, we might have heard of some incidents relating to Janaka Chakravarthi. Janaka was learning from a great sage named Yajnavalkya. Janaka is by nature wise. So, he would listen keenly, observe and learn from the guru’s teachings. Generally, a teacher wants to look at the student who is studying well. The teacher wants to try to get that student to learn more. Whereas, if someone doesn’t evolve despite being taught multiple times, the teacher won’t be enthused. The rest of the students were this way. However, Janaka was very attentive and keen. Hence, the guru would teach him. Janaka finished his schooling, and returned to the kingdom and became a king. Even after that, the guru would quote Janaka as an example to students of later batches. The guru would say, “He was very attentive and wise. He would answer very well.”\n    The students got angry. They were jealous. “Guru likes Janaka because he is a king. A king has lots of money to give.” “A king can honor him with so many services. He can give many respectful offerings.” “Many gifts, and articles.” “So, he likes him. What can we give?” They started to talk amongst each other. This impression grew stronger. Guru was able to make this out. He thought he should teach them a lesson. He should make them understand why he had taught Janaka with so much interest. He felt it was necessary to tell them why he quotes him and refers to him occasionally, even now.\n    There are always some leaders in the group. So, he called two such ‘leader’ students. The guru gave them two objects and asked them to hand them over to Janaka. He asked them to find out how he was doing and return. He gave this message to them and sent them both. These students thought about Janaka - how he could be a self-realized one, yet simultaneously a king. “We are in the asramam. We have attained knowledge of the self.” “As a ruler, he needs to talk to so many people and go everywhere.” “Where is the knowledge of the self while doing all of this?!” “How can he have knowledge of the self? How can he be a karma yogi (one who practices karma yoga)?” “How can he be the ideal one for karma yoga (path of action)?” “How can he do that? He will need to punish many. He will need to praise many.” “Guru has partiality.” This is how they talked amongst each other. The two ‘important’ ones. He sent them both to ‘examine’.\n    They both arrived. Janaka learned that they had come from his guru. He felicitated and arranged grand accommodation for them. He said that he would meet them both after they have their dinner. He arranged a proper dining area for them with great exquisite flooring. Great walls, awesome paintings around. The ceiling had wonderful designs. They were offered golden seats. They were served on golden plates. Their servers were beautiful. The cooked dishes were aromatic and flavorful. Wonderful arrangements were made for their bath as well. They sat down to have their meal. They were looking at all the beautiful ornamentation around. As they looked up, they saw two large sharp-edged swords hanging, each directly above them. If either fell, it would directly hit the brahmarandhra (a specific point on the crown of the head) on their head! Also, it wasn’t held securely, connected only by a thin string. If the string comes undone, they will attain ‘moksha (liberation)’.\n    They were just reciting their pre-meal prayers which include offering water. They were half way through. They should finish that offering. After the prayer was offered, they should have the meal. If they don’t, that becomes a dosha (sin). They cannot get up until the post-meal prayers are offered. Whatever was served, should not be left. Hence, they must eat. So, they continued to finish the pre-meal prayers that they had started and were half way through. Om pranaya swaha, apanaya swaha (offerings to the vital airs)… The serving team was serving. They were eating. They completed the entire meal. They completed the post-meal prayers. They got up and left feeling, relieved as if given a new life. They took tambula (mouth-freshener). They washed their hands and everything was completed.\n    It was then that King Janaka paid a visit. “We are blessed to have you. We could not spend time with you until now due to our work.” “Yet, we are happy that you had a nice meal..” “I got urad dal ladoo specially made for you. Did you eat?” They didn’t know what they had eaten! “I also asked them to make gulab jamuns for you. Did you have them?” “I got them to make a very yummy fry, and a special curry, also mustard based pickle.” “I also got them to make many others. Did you eat all of them?” There was nothing left on the plate but… They didn’t remember eating gulab jamun, urad dal ladoo, mustard based curry, fry, etc… They said they didn’t focus on what they were eating. “I got them made specially for you. How come you did not relish any of them?” “Did our people not serve you well?” [to the serving team] “Hey…what happened?” “You have done everything well but you hung a knife on the top of our head.” “We would die if the knife fell on the head.” “How could we eat? We just ate something quickly, that’s all.” They had eaten everything. They did not hold back on the activity of the senses. Their hands worked. Their mouths worked. Their eyes worked. Their tongues worked. Their plates were emptied. However, because their focus was on the knife overhead pointing down at them rather than at the food… Despite the activities taking place, they did not get tied to them. Otherwise, they would have described each of the items they had. Despite doing the activities, they had their focus on that [knife] rather than these [the food items]. So, they [senses] could not tie him to them.\n    Similarly, when a person can establish a goal in his life… Either a worldly goal or … A goal of atma sakshatkara (self-realization) - for a jnani (wise one), a goal of Bhagavad sakshatkara (God-realization), for a bhakta (devotee)… Let it be anything… Only when one has a goal that is beyond the senses and their objects in the world… One can emerge from the clutches of these enemies. Otherwise, one will fall prey to them and continue… Like Yamadharma Raja (Lord of Death) said… punah punaha vasam apadyathe me (He will continue to fall prey to them and get tied to them). Nothing else! He is explaining this in Bhagavad Gita, verse 3.34. He is explaining about the primary enemies. Let us try to learn clearly about them.\n    Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIn the world around us, there are many varieties of things that attract us. How do we stay safe from all of them? How should we progress towards our goal?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, grants all wealth, and is the delight of the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna started to explain this in chapter 3. As He explained, He said…\n“Because I am the One who set up the world and souls within it. If you leave the responsibility to Me, I will make them the world and remaining souls suitable for you.”\nHowever, some have their ahanka:ra (ego) blocking them. They think, \"Why should someone else help me?\" They think, “Am I not capable?!” They think, “I can do my own work.” This is over-confidence. Or there are some people with very aggressive egotistic mentality. If such people attempt, how successful they will be depends on their efforts. However, even for such people [God advises]. God does not develop any hatred for them. He does not have either ra:ga (love) or dwe:sha (hatred). Even for them, it is essential to explain how to take control [of the senses]. God is thus clarifying to them the path for the same. He does so in Bhagavad Gita, verse 3.33.\nFirstly, He says that the effort one exerts which is driven by one’s own wish, has very little effect. Similar to a handful of sugar in an ocean. If one wants to get rid of the saltiness of the ocean by sprinkling a couple of handfuls of sugar… Will there be any impact? Similarly, He said that it is not possible to take control [of senses] with your effort. Why? Because their pressure is high.\nHow do these get formed? There are two underlying enemies who drive them. They are ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred). Where are these? They are not in external objects. They are in you, with the senses. How do they get formed? They get formed based on the experiences in the past. If you have any experience with anything, that experience is recorded permanently. They are not temporary records. These days, recorded videos are generally saved for a month or two, or two years, or two decades. If they are no longer needed, they are deleted. Or they extract what they think they need and the rest is deleted. Whatever is deleted is gone. However, whatever is recorded by the senses is not something that gets deleted. All the experiences of the activities done in the past are recorded in them. Our activities are based on them.\nIf one gets used to eating something sour and comes across it somewhere else… He reacts to it saying it is something he is used to. That’s because there is sour food outside and there is a record of the sour taste inside. As soon as he sees the sour-dish, the related record in him surfaces and tries to add to it. Accordingly, it will inspire him. Yes, there is a [related] record inside. “I want that. Come on, give me that. Go towards that.” “Pick it up. Bring it to me. Feed me.” There is a record inside. It’s a va:sana (imprint). Accordingly, ra:ga (attachment) and dwe:sha (aversion) get formed. If it’s suitable, there is ra:ga (favorability) towards it. If it’s not suitable, there is dwe:sha (unfavorability) towards it. The external objects are not the reason. The objects are the same. Snake. Poison. Nectar. Flower. Fish. Fruit. The objects in nature are just natural with their own attributes. However, you feel something is suitable or not-suitable due to samska:ras (internal imprints). They are called ra:ga and dwe:sha. They are one’s primary enemies. Do those enemies dwell in him [soul] or in them [the objects outside]? This is what He is saying.\nSome do business selling salted dry fish. Do you know about salted dry fish? Some may know, not everyone. Some may ‘know them well’! The fish are sun-dried. After that, they don’t stink. The fishermen living on the shore join in groups of 50 and carry baskets of those to the city. They sell them and return. They sun-dry the [new set] and repeat. Generally, they don’t stink. However, if they get wet, they smell very bad.\nOnce, they all dried them and were carrying the baskets [of dried fish]. It got dark. They reached half-way and had to stop somewhere as it’s not easy to travel at night. They looked around and found a nice house. They reached the house and asked for some space for the night and said that they would leave early in the morning. He [the owner] said okay. He said there is a garage at the back where they all can stay. “No problem.” They all went there and lay down. However, they couldn’t fall asleep. It became 10:00pm, 11:00pm, 12:00pm… They came out not knowing why they weren't able to sleep. Then, they found out that it is the house of a flower-seller. He stocked up rose flowers that same afternoon just next to the garage. The flower bundles were all in the baskets. These people had baskets and there were also baskets there. Those baskets had rose flowers. Their baskets had salted dry fish. They lay down but the fragrance of the flowers was suffocating them. It was not working out for them. They didn’t know what to do. It was 11, 12 and eventually 1am at night. They had to travel the next morning. They had a business to run in the morning. If they didn’t sleep at night, they wouldn’t work. They consulted an elderly person in their team to think about what to do. He asked them to sprinkle some water on their baskets. They got water from the nearby tap, opened the lids of the baskets and sprinkled water on them all. This released a powerful odor suppressing the fragrance of the rose flowers. Then, they were able to get a sound sleep. They were able to sleep easily.\nThe fish had their smell. The roses had their smell. Nothing changed in them. However, the do:sham (unfavorability) is unique to the specific person, [not with the object]. Is a rose flower bad? Is its fragrance bad? Is the smell of salted dry fish that great? It is for those who eat it. Is that good or is this bad? Is the fragrance of rose good or is that bad? Nothing in nature is bad. The fragrance of rose is that of a rose. The fragrance of fish is that of a fish. Whether it’s likable by someone or not depends on the samska:ra (tendencies) of the person who is habituated to it. This person’s life is based on salted dry fish. He took birth in the families of that profession. He grew up there. He is living in that. Hence, it became the basis for his life. Some others cannot take it. This person has dwe:sha (unfavorability) for the roses and ra:ga (favorability) for the fish. How about for the house owner? When the smell of the fish began to spread through the house, he woke up in the middle of the night. He wondered what happened. He sensed a foul odor. The fish seller felt the same odor to be a pleasant one. What is the reason? Because each of them has a favorable fragrance by nature. They are neither bad nor good fragrances. However, the samska:ra (tendency) of the person who got habituated to something caused ra:ga (attachment) and dwe:sha (aversion) in him for that. Whereas the other person developed ra:ga (attachment) and dwe:sha (aversion) for the opposite. These are not appropriate for either of those people.\nthau hyasya paripantthinau (these are his enemies)\nWhat is good for someone depends on the person’s goal. If he has a goal that is better and bigger, he won’t focus on other things. In Bhagavad Gita, Krishna always says… Ra:ga (attachment) and dwe:sha (aversion) are not in the objects, but rather in the person. They are in the ji:va (the soul). If you can recognize them to be the enemies within here, you should put them away. When will you be able to put them away? Only when you think of them to be not your goal. Only then, you will be able to put them away.\nIf a person has a goal to work in the office, he won’t notice snacks that are placed outside. Gup chup or pani puri, masala peas, or fried jalebi, or anything else. These are not his goals. When his work at office is the goal, that’s what he will keep doing. If there is no such goal and he is someone who has come for entertainment… Then he will find all the snack places interesting. He will eat this, that, and everything else. His goal would be this. When this is his goal, he will have to behave as per its effect. If he doesn’t want these to be his goal, he must have something more serious than them. There must be a target that he needs to achieve while at the office. He won’t notice them, their colors, tastes, etc. So, having a goal is important. Are you forming a goal or not? Is your goal the ‘bad’ fragrance of the flowers or the ‘good’ fragrance of the fish? Or something else? This is what we must remember.\nSo, these are the enemies and they are within. They are not outside. There is nothing something [outside] can do to us. However, a thief who lives in the house is very dangerous. People say, even God cannot help with a thief in the house. So, this is very dangerous. It is important to take control of the inner enemies, not the external ones. What should you do to gain control over them? You should have better and bigger goals in mind. This is primarily what bhagava:n (God) wants to teach.\nSome say dwe:sha (aversion) shouldn’t exist within, but ra:ga (attachment) can. Ra:ga (attachment) is wrong. Dwe:sha (aversion) is wrong. They are like punya (results of virtuous activities) and pa:pa (results of sinful activities). Both punya and pa:pa are wrong. Why? Punya also makes you go through experiences. Pa:pa also decreases only after experiencing it. To experience pa:pa, you need one body. To experience punya, you need a body as well. How does it matter what body it is, if they are both tying you up anyway. One is a gold body and another is an iron body. Pa:pa is like a body made of iron. Punya is like a body made of gold. How does it matter what it is made of? Gold shackles or iron shackles. Both are going to tie one up, restricting him. So, one should be free from both ra:ga (attachment) and dwe:sha (aversion). Both should subside. To lower them, there should be a goal formed within. That can bring them down. It is very important to form that goal. If you have that goal and try without My support, maybe you can achieve it. You can give it a try. There is no mistake in it - but first, know about them. In chapter 3, verse 34, saying so, He was describing the order in which inner enemies [affect].\nLet’s learn…\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIn chapter 3, Sri Krishna is explaining topics necessary to help us to move forward properly. What are the hurdles in the journey? What is their nature? \"How can you overcome them through your efforts?\" \"Or If you want to depend on anyone, why choose anyone else? I am here. Depend on Me.\" He said. If you say you don’t need to depend on anyone or… If you think that you do not need anyone to support you and that you will try yourself… At least know what those hurdles are and make your efforts. This is what He wanted to say in summary from verse 3.34 onwards.\nSometimes, we can’t do something despite our desire to do so. In some cases, despite not desiring to do something, our tendencies make us do it. Do you know the reason for it? `Ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred). `Ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred) do not let us act as per our resolve. They will drag us as per them like an underwater current. If a person sits in a heavy flow, he gets carried away by it. How should we face them in such a case? History demonstrated examples for us. Firstly, you must have a goal.\nWhat is the reason for `ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred)?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all prosperity, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nindriyas ye:ndriyasy a:rtthe: ra:gadve:shau vyavastthithau |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAttachment and aversion are established in the objects of each sense.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhere do `ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred) come from? How do they come? We should know that first. What do we know about `ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred) to begin with? Do they stand in front of you and introduce themselves to you? “I am `ra:ga` (love) and I am `dwe:sha` (hatred).” It’s not like the story of Sra:vana and Bha:drapada.\nAn elderly person was leaving for town. He has an innocent wife. He is leaving for 2 months. She is going to be staying alone. He bought all the necessary groceries, etc. It is the rainy season and it won’t be easy to go out. He said, “Sra:vana and Bha:drapada’s are approaching. Watch out.” As soon as he left, two guys knocked on the door and introduced themselves. One as Sra:vana and another as Bha:drapada. She reacted saying that her husband talked greatly of them. She said he bought all the groceries for them. She welcomed them and offered all the services. She fed them for 2 months with many varieties of dishes including sweet and savory. Knowing that he was arriving the next day, they both left the place. He noticed that everything he bought was all exhausted! She said, “You were the one who said Sra:vana and Bha:drapada will arrive.” “They came and left yesterday. I offered everything in respect to them.” He said, “Oh no! What a “great” thing you did! Sra:vana and Bha:drapada are the names of the months! They are not people!” She felt bad. What’s the use? It was all over by then.\nSimilarly, are `ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred) two people? Do they introduce themselves as… “I am `ra:ga` (love).” “I am `dwe:sha` (hatred).” Do they come and show themselves to you? No. They make us come into their grip. They are such dangerous inner enemies. Watch out. He started explaining about them. “Do you want to try to take control of these inner enemies or do you want Me to help?” “I don’t need any help.” “That’s fine. At least help yourselves. Firstly, know how they attack you.” Shouldn’t we know first?\nIn those days, Coronavirus attacked! What it is. How does it attack? What does it do? There should be some awareness. That way, when it attacks, it will be clear what attacked you. Accordingly, there will be a chance to be careful. At least try to understand what they are. After that, it’s your wish. If you want to try to overcome them, do it. However, there are great people who tried that way and couldn’t succeed.\nWe learned about Jadabharatha earlier. He was a great and efficient ruler. He was the one who the world is named after - Bha:rath (India). A great ruler. However, what’s the use? He thought he would do `yo:gam` (spiritual practice) by himself to attain self-realization. He left for the forests. He did `sa:dhana` (practice). However, he fell into the control of a baby deer. He got occupied in protecting the baby deer and took his final breath with the same thought. He forgot his goal. Because he depended on his own efforts, his next birth was as a deer.\nThe other one was Viswa:mithra who formed a goal. We spoke about him earlier as well. What was the goal he had? To become a `Bramharshi` (sage who has realized Brahman). That’s all was his goal. Because of this goal, he went in all directions and performed `thapas` (penance). He fell prey for the `ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred) that were in him and [his `thapas` (penance)] was destroyed in different ways. However, because he had a firm goal, he pulled himself up and practiced again. He fell again. He pulled himself up again. He practiced again. The same repeated. Because he had a firm goal, he came back up despite falling multiple times. Ultimately, he was able to attain it. He was so determined and attained it so well that Sri Ra:ma Himself became his `da:san` (servant), and `sishya` (disciple). He was a `kriyasi:la` (taskmaster). Can we do such intense practice? Try it. He spent 10,000 years in `thapas` (penance) performing `sa:dhana` (practice), in each direction. 10,000 years! It’s not a normal effort. If you have that much time, energy, patience, then try it.\nThere was another great sage named Kanva. Great sage, Kanva! He limited `ra:ga` (love), `dwe:sha` (hatred) and love to the levels they should be in. He had a firm goal. He did not get `pathanam` (destruction) [by them]. Great Sage Kanva! There was a baby girl, perhaps the daughter of Viswamithra. The sage came across the baby girl. Two birds were taking care of her. Because she was being guarded by the birds, he named her Sakunthala. He raised her. He didn’t have `ra:ga` (love) for her. He didn’t have `dwe:sha` (hatred) for those who left her there. He didn’t develop `ra:ga` (love) for her because he was with her. He brought her up for some years. She was grown up. She was able to decide who she wanted to get married to. She loved King Dusshyantha. That’s fine, [he thought]. He sent two of her friends along with her to drop her off there. We know the story. She was taken there. However, due to a curse, the king could not recollect who she was. She became an orphan. However, he didn’t own her after that incident. He raised her for the time that he took responsibility. When she made a choice for her husband. He sent her there. He stayed unaffected after that. Because he had self-realization as a goal, he could control `ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred). They didn’t affect him. Although Viswamithra was great, they affected him. They affected Jadabharatha in the earlier timeline. He was also a great one. However, `ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred) did not affect Sage Kanva. Why? Because he recognized what his friend and what his enemy are. His goal is his friend. He made a resolve not to let the inner enemies called `ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred) raise their heads on his path. They did not. After he sent her away, she lived her life. She made a choice and she continued her journey accordingly. That’s why he sent her away. This is what a human being must realize.\nHe clarified that in verse 3.34.\n`indriyas ye:ndriyasy a:rtthe: ra:gadve:shau vyavastthithau |` (Attachment and aversion are established in the objects of each sense.)\n`indriyasya ra:gadve:shau` (the senses' attachment and aversion)\n`indraya:rtthe: vyavastthithau` (established in the objects of the senses)\nBecause of the activity of the `vishayas` (sense objects), they are stable in the senses alone.\n`thayo:r na vasam a:gachche:th` (do not come under their pressure)\nThey are the primary enemies, dear! He clarifies this aspect in chapter 3. “Firstly, have a firm goal.” This is what He wanted to explain primarily.\nThere is nothing with the external objects. Pleasure and pain are that which manifest inside. Cold and hot are with the external objects. They are always that way. However, the feeling that “cool weather is suitable for me, hot weather is unsuitable for me…” “Hot weather is suitable for me while cool weather is unsuitable for me…” There are favorable and unfavorable feelings. `sama si:tho:shna` (equanimity towards cold and heat). The equanimity towards pain and pleasure must happen within. Equanimity is a quality that is internal, not an external one. Externally, you must act accordingly. Why? Because the body is formed for action. It is made for work. So, you must keep working. You might think of the work as favorable at times and unfavorable at other times. But still, it’s okay.\nThe border protection force is always on the watch holding guns to scare [those who try to cross]. Is it right to scare them? Yes, because it is their duty. They are beyond `ra:ga` (love) and `dwe:sha` (hatred), determined with the goal to protect the border. So, it’s not wrong for them. If there is an enemy trying to enter, it is allowed to shoot them if necessary. Can you say that it is wrong to resort to violence? It’s not wrong for them. Yes. It could be wrong for someone else. His goal is to serve the ordained duty to protect the country. To do so...\nWhen doing some good deeds, there may be troubling mosquitoes, etc. How are people handling that? People are buying [electric] bats, killing them. What’s this horrific act of killing! Is this allowed? There is a goal. Perhaps it is an exam or an act that’s going to help many others, or constructing an object, etc. Because he has formed a goal, anything that obstructs his goal and the work can be curbed. He has to work in the direction that he needs to. Anything that is a hurdle on the path has to be handled. It’s not right to have love or hatred for them wondering why you are having to act that way. Border protection force is the best example for us. Can they resort to violence? They must do so if it is inevitable when the goal is higher and greater.\nWhen does a goal become ‘higher’ and ‘greater’? That also changes, doesn’t it? It [the goal] should be related and suitable to one’s position, country, and other species around. That is when a goal becomes greater. If the goal is only limited to one’s own benefit and not for others, that’s a bad goal. If it’s something useful for more people, then it’s not wrong to do what’s essential for it. That’s why, while explaining this to Arjuna, Sri Krishna tells him… `yuddhvasya vigathajwaraha` (fight without agitation). You think that you will be hurting them in the war. That’s the wrong [mindset]. If your goal is higher, then it’s not wrong to eliminate such people. Eliminate them. This is a wonderful direction that `Bhagava:n` (Lord) gives to those who want to carry out their responsibilities. Let’s learn.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

What stays is the soul.\nIt is the soul that’s caught up amidst prakruthi (nature).\nWhat one must work for, is to separate the soul from nature so it stays in its natural state.\nOur sages named that state as atma sakshatkara (self-realization).\nGod is the One who makes it happen.\nIf one can learn about God, this also comes into control.\nHence, it is called bhagavad sakshatkara (God realization).\nYou can have either that or this as the goal.\nOtherwise, if you don’t want to go all the way there, you can aim for a higher state in your current life.\nThere must be some goal.\nIf one understands his goal, he won’t care for anything else that comes in between.\nFor a bala (little one), the goal is to get something to eat.\nFor someone who is just crawling…\nHe wants to eat some sweets, chocolate, or whatever!\nHis goal is anything that can be eaten. Give him gold and he refuses it.\nGive him valuable diamonds, each costing 70 or 100 crores.\nHe will throw them away. They are immaterial to him. They are of no use to him.\nGive him a banana. He will take it immediately. That is his goal, something to eat!\n[He doesn’t care] for anything that is not edible.\nYou may say, ‘hey! That’s gold, that’s diamond.’\nBut that’s only useful for you. He has a goal.\nThere is no use of anything that is different from the goal, no matter how great or of what kind.\nThere is no need of raga (liking), or dwesha (dislike) towards them.\nYou give him gold and he will throw it away.\nIf someone takes it away, he doesn’t mind.\n“Someone is taking away such a valuable thing of mine!”\nHe won’t feel either anger or hatred toward that person.\n“You gave me such valuable gold and costly diamonds!”\nHe won’t give any big hugs or treat that person specially.\nWhy? Because the little one has a goal.\nA goal-oriented person doesn’t care about anything regardless of how ‘valuable’ they may be.\nTo tell this, Vedanta gives us the example of the little boy.\nIf a human being has the wealth of knowledge, tattva jnana (knowledge of realities), he will also be like the little one.\nGood knowledge is called panda.\nOne who has panda is called a pandit (one who has good knowledge).\nWhat a pandit has is called pandithyam (good knowledge).\nHow does the one with good knowledge behave?\npandithya nirvijya balyena thishtaseth atha munihi (one whose knowledge is fully ripened, he will behave like a little one)\nWhat does it mean to behave like a little one?\nDoes it mean to simply have his diaper changed, cry, crawl, etc.? No!\nWe must observe the qualities of a bala (little one).\nWhat are the qualities of a little one?\nNishkapata (honesty). He will laugh if he finds something funny. He will cry if he finds something sad.\n“I am sitting in a meeting. Hence I should not laugh.”\n“I am sitting in a meeting. Hence, I should not cry.”\nHe won’t feel that way. Whatever is within, that’s what is expressed externally.\nIt is called Rujuthvam (honesty).\nA pandit will have Rujuthvam (honesty).\nThis is a quality in a bala (little one).\nWhat is the second one?\nA curiosity to learn / know anything.\nHe has curiosity for something that’s new.\nThis is a quality in a pandit.\nFor anything good, he wants to be able to realize it, grasp it, and know about it.\nHe has tatparata (curiosity) about learning something good.\nThis is the second one.\nThe third one…\nHe won’t have the quality of boasting about his greatness.\nLittle kids are cute. All of them are good-looking.\nAs they grow with unnatural and fraudulent things, they become scary to look at.\nUntil then, all kids have the same language, thought and action.\nThey all cry in the same way irrespective of being from a Telugu, English, Tamil, Urdu, or Arabic family.\nLanguage is not a barrier for them.\nThoughts don’t hold him back.\nIn such a state, kids are so lovable and good-looking.\nIf you praise little ones, they don’t go and compete in Mr. World or Ms. World.\nThey don’t care if they are being praised or criticized.\nThey don’t have the tendency to boast about their being so great in this or that aspect.\nThis is their greatness.\nMeaning, they take everything with equanimity.\nHe smiles when you criticize. He smiles when you praise.\nEven if you scold or praise, he smiles.\nHe doesn’t care about anything, i.e. engrossed in his goal and not caring about anything aside from that goal.\nHe is fixed to his goal. We see this in kids.\nIf a small toy is all that he wants, he keeps playing with it.\nIf he is in his mother’s lap, he plays happily.\nOutside of that, it doesn’t matter what you give or say to him.\nThis is childhood.\nThis is also a pandit’s quality, with a small difference.\nThe quality of the little one is a reflection of jnana anudaya (his unripened state of knowledge).\nA pandit can be that way because of jnana paripaka (the ripened state of knowledge in him).\nOne is filled with knowledge while another has no knowledge.\nBut, both their pravrutthi (behavior), is the same.\nGenerally, we say that 60+ is the second childhood.\nDoes it mean he wakes up one day and starts to talk like a child and cry? No.\nWhat does he do then?\nThe state of equanimity..\nmanava manayoho tulyaha (taking everything with equanimity)\ntulya nindastuthihi (equanimous to criticism and praise)\nsamalostah kanchana (equanimous to a lump of clay and gold)\nAbove are the qualities that we are told about.\nTaking everything with equanimity -\nNot boasting about his greatness -\nBeing honest -\nThe expectation is that after 60 years, one will have a ripened and complete state of mind.\nThat is why, people say that whoever crosses 60 years is like a child.\nA child is compared to God. And so, the older people are compared to God.\nWhether they actually become the same like God is a different topic.\nHowever, such a person is one who can be a muni (able to control emotions).\nMuni (one who stays calm).\nOthers react very positively for anything favorable.\nIf something is not suitable, they react very harshly.\nWith them, there is no balanced state of affairs.\nRaga (liking) and dwesha (dislike) do not work on him [muni].\nA bala (little one) out of unripened knowledge…\nA pandit out of ripened knowledge…\nBoth keep raga (liking) and dwesha (dislike) in their own limits.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthayo:r na vasam a:gachche:th thau hyasya paripantthinau || v3.34\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne should not come under the control of these two (liking and disliking), for they are indeed his enemies.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn verse 3.34, He says that they don’t come under their control.\nA pandit realizes that they are his enemies and puts them aside.\nA bala (little one) doesn’t know about them and so he stays out of them.\nHowever, both of them act. Both have karma acharana (work to do).\nBecause he is a bala (little one), he moves his hands and legs.\nHe behaves appropriately when his mother is giving him a bath.\nHe smiles when he sees someone or someone talks to him.\nHe smiles if he is feeling good.\nHe doesn’t think of his smile to be showering pearls.\nHe doesn’t smile for the sake of a photo or show off.\nHe doesn’t get excited about his looks.\nHis smile is natural.\nThis is in a bala (little one).\nIn a pandit, because his knowledge level is ripened, there is a maturity in him.\nThat state is useful for the child to grow.\nIn the older one [pandit], it is useful to give direction to others.\nThat is the difference between the both.\nSo, Arjuna…\n“Do you think you can control the inner enemies on your own? If so, try it.”\n“Otherwise, depend on Me.”\nmayi sarvani karmani sannyasya adhyatma chetasa (With good thoughts of the learned mind, leave that relation to Me.)\nI will take care of it.\nThen, the karma acharana (work you do), will not bind you to it.\nyuddhyasya vigatha jwaraha (You can happily do your work. There will be no fault.)\nThis is the teaching given in chapter 3 to guide Arjuna forward.\nLet’s continue to gradually learn.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\n(I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all dangers, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nAn ant at its level, a mosquito at its level, a human being at his level, Brahma at his level… The great sages say that all of them have ahanka:ra (ego). As soon as a human takes birth on this earth, the effect of the earth gives rise to ahanka:ra (ego). When elevated, one feels that there is no one greater than he. During Dhanurma:sa, we hear Goda Devi saying that there is ahanka:ra (ego) in everyone as per their respective levels.\nanganma:n jna:na thalasar abhima:nam (I am the king here!)\nWhen one is in this body, he feels that he is ruling his body. A mosquito feels it is its kingdom. Brahma feels it’s his kingdom. The amount of air that a tree can give is dependent on the size of the tree. That’s how it is. Ahanka:ra (ego) puts one in a state which hinders the achievement of his goal. As one’s false ego decreases, it becomes more suitable for him to make progress. However, it is very difficult to eliminate ego completely. Because this kingdom is a very beautiful one. There are a variety of stages and experiences. We see a lot of scenes in the external world. Similarly, there are a lot of ‘scenes’ here as well. There is an external world and an inner world. It’s quite difficult to overcome and escape from the effects of both worlds.\nMany people in the world feel that whatever is happening is because of them. They feel that things are working as they are, because of them, which is really not the case. Many great people passed away. Nothing stopped. The sun is rising. Stars are moving. The moon is shining. Wind is blowing. Trees are growing. Birds are flying. Rivers are flowing. Nothing stopped. Everything is going on its own. The person left, that’s all. The one who was egotistic about everything has left but yet we don’t realize. Everyone thinks the world will stop if they aren’t around. “If my broomstick and stove aren’t there, the Sun won’t rise.” This is the kind of unwanted egoistic attitude human beings have.\nWhy does such an attitude develop? It is because people do not know their goal. Why am I in this? For what reason am I traveling on this journey? This is the danger of not having that kind of knowledge and the corresponding goal. Generally, there is a responsibility of running a family for the wife and husband. They have kids. To what extent is their responsibility? It is the responsibility of parents to raise them until the children can stand on their own. If they can stand on their own, they should be left to live by themselves happily. However, that is not the case. “I want to be the one doing everything. I should be the one to tell them what to study.” “I should be the one to tell them what job they should take.” “I should be the one to tell who they should marry.” “I should be the one to tell them how to have kids.” “I should be the one to tell them what they should do.” “I should be the one to take them [the grand kids] to school.” Following with their wedding, etc. My God! Where does this end? Why did he take birth? Is this why? Or is there a goal for human life? Because of forgetting that there is a goal… They succumb to ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred), at the body and senses level. They keep going around in circles only on these aspects. When visiting a temple, one thinks about her granddaughter’s entrance to college. When will my granddaughter get married? When will my great grandson get a visa? Do you want such a goal after living all this life?! You had kids. You raised them. You helped them settle down in a home. Your job is over. Your responsibility is done. Why do you carry the rest and where do you sink to?\nWe notice that’s not how people feel. They think they are the ones doing everything. They [family] don’t listen to them. They don’t work according to them. They cry over that. In fact, this is not a difficulty one faces by nature. These are all sorrows one ‘buys’ and gets. This is how about 99.9% of the people in the world live. That is why the entire world runs. Otherwise, because Lord incarnated several times, and He liberated many souls every time He incarnated, the global show would have ceased by now. But, that didn’t happen. Do we let that happen? No. We want it to go on. He wants to rest after ending it all. When none of this exists, it’s called maha:pralaya (the grand dissolution). “What happens if the mega dissolution takes place? None of this will exist.” “No way. I am the one making all of this happen. Screenplay, direction - it’s all mine!” “Hence, what happens if I am not there? Something will happen to all of this.” Nothing will happen. Nothing is happening because of someone. Nothing will stop despite anyone’s absence. However, our ego makes us feel that the world is running on our shoulders. That is the primary cause for a person to be tied up here. Having that feeling is why even great people have come back in this circle of life. We alluded to many such examples in the past. Jadabharatha and others.\nA person cannot refuse to do any work. However, what should his feelings be, and to what extent? As long as there is life, he should keep working. How much should one work at each age? As a ba:la (little kid), to what extent should he work? As a gruhastha (married person), to what extent should he work? As a yuva (a young adult), to what extent should he work? As a vruddha (an old person), to what extent should he work? There is nothing wrong if one can recognise to what extent he should work in his situation. However, the hindrance is the always rising ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred) due to the effect of imprints of tastes from the past. He says in verse 3.34.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nindriyas ye:ndriyasy a:rtthe: ra:gadve:shau vyavastthithau |\nthayo:r na vasam a:gachche:th thau hyasya paripantthinau ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAttachment and aversion are fixed in relation to the objects of the senses. One should not come under their sway, for they are indeed one’s enemies.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey are the prime enemies, dear! He develops love for his grandson. He asks him to do something. The grandson refuses. He said it with love. He doesn’t do it, or his mother or father won’t let him do it. Because I am the one who advised, he should do it as per my guidance. If he decides independently, he begins to worry. He develops hatred for one who gave another piece of advice to him. That is how hatred begins. In fact, he does not need ra:ga (love) or dwe:sha (hatred). He does not need either. Because his responsibility is over, he can happily spend time chanting the names of Krishna and Rama. Or a number of other things he can do in this humongous world. There is so much social service one can do, isn’t it? However, we see that it’s not the case. There is an ocean of work and only a couple of drops are being completed. Why? Is it because there are no human beings? Or no energy? Or no intelligence? No. It is the effect of unwanted egoistic nature. It keeps pulling one down, making him think that he can achieve everything while not caring for anyone. The cause is the primary enemies called ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred).\nWhat is it that he should do instead? Don’t stop doing any work. Every activity at the physical level must continue to happen. None of these can stop, yet, that shouldn’t be the goal. When your goal is 1000, if someone wants to stay at 1, constantly staring at it only… People will laugh. These responsibilities of ours are like the 1 or 2 or 3. That is where we are. However, the energy that should be put into the higher goal is being wasted in protecting the 1. That is the painful stuff. The root cause is the ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred) stemming from the effects of past tastes and tendencies. You should be at such heights. However you are being tied up at this lower level. “Oh dear, this is not appropriate.” This is what Sri Krishna is trying to explain in verse 3.34.\nthayo:r na vasam a:gachche:th (don’t succumb to them)\nWhy?\nparipantthinau (they are primary enemies)\nBut, shouldn’t we be doing some kind of work? No, not just any kind of work, but the right kind of work. Someone went into a laboratory. He felt thirsty there. If he drinks acid there, what happens? It’s not important that he simply drinks something, it also has to be an appropriate beverage. There is no need to touch anything that is not necessary. “What’s wrong with that? It’s clear. It is liquid.” It burns him! If he washes his hands with it saying it’s water… That is kept in a bottle. This is also kept in a bottle. Saying so, if he pours it on his hands, it burns! Just as knowing what to use is important, and not just using any liquid… It is not important to simply work, it is important to know what kind of work and how. In a railway station, if you say that boarding any train is important and not which one… If you say that the train on a platform is very full as there is a huge unruly crowd… And that there’s an empty train on another platform - claiming that one is comfortable for all the luggage, etc. If you sleep and put your luggage in a different compartment on that other train… The train that you have to board is full, there is a huge rush. That’s okay. That is the train that will take you to the goal. Irrespective of whether you like it or it’s difficult or it’s hard or it’s yielding loss or comfort or difficulty… You must travel in it somehow by hanging in there. You can’t say you will take the other train because it’s comfortable. Did you come to the railway station for comfort? Did you buy the ticket for comfort? You got it to reach your destination. Anything that blocks you from traveling towards your destination is an enemy. The first enemy is…\nra:gadwe:shau vyavastthithau (love or hatred, these are feelings within you)\nthayo:r na vasam a:gachche:th thau hyasya paripantthinau || (One should not come under their sway, for they are indeed one’s enemies.)\nThese are different for each. The goal and the journey for the goal are different [for each]. One might argue… “‘That is a body, this is also a body. It has blood, and this one has blood.” “He has hunger. I have hunger.” This is all nonsensical talk. For example, we can’t see anything in the dark despite having eyes. There is a body and senses. What is the use? Without light, we can’t see anything. A cat has a body and senses too. It has eyes. However, it can see in the dark. Each body has its mechanism setup differently. Realize this. Train it for the goal that’s appropriate for you. Realize that they [ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred)] are enemies. So, keep them in limits. If you are controlled by them, you cannot reach your goal. Your opportunity will be wasted. So, do not spoil the human body that you have been given with unnecessary activities. You cannot refuse to do activities. “Why do all these activities, karma… nonsense?!” “Give it up. Sit freely, and do nothing.” This is not an acceptable way. You must work. You must know your goal and habituate yourself to work accordingly. Remember that ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred) are the primary enemies. Saying so… In chapter 3, Paramatma (Supreme Soul) Sri Krishna is trying to explain the direction and path that we must take. Let’s try to learn this.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nFrom the teachings of Sri Krishna, we are learning…\nWhat the origin is for the hurdles our work faces, or for the goals we set.\nHow do we understand and overcome them?\nOr how do we depend on Him and submit to Him, the One who can eliminate them for us?\nWhile keeping in view the context of earlier verses, we are trying to get answers from verse 3.34.\nOne cannot renounce doing his work.\nOne cannot give up his responsibilities.\nOne must continue to work.\nHowever, generally one tends to feel that he is the one doing all the work.\nHe feels that nothing will happen without him.\nSo, he feels that all the good and bad outcomes of the work are his.\nGenerally, such an egoistic nature develops in a human being.\nThe reason for this is the underlying ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred) within humans.\nThese must be somewhat suppressed.\nThese behaviors must be curbed. Work must not be stopped.\nYou must continue to work.\nHowever, you must realize the underlying cause of the work being done.\nPosing as if you have done everything, when in reality all is already taken care of!\nThat is called durahanka:ra (undesired ego).\nThe sun is not rising because of us.\nTrees are not growing because of us.\nWhen we plant any saplings, we end up destroying rather than improving that area.\nNo one can stop many great natural outcomes.\nWe are not the cause for all of that, they are happening naturally.\nThey have their own behaviors.\nThey are not something we can amend.\nThe neem tree has its bitterness or umami. That is its quality.\nThe Tamarind tree has its quality. There are different insects that feed on each.\nThere are some insects that crawl on neem trees.\nAlwar says…\nve:mbin puji ve:mbanni nilla:da: po:l (The bitterness is the insect’s food)\nIt is the bitterness that is the insect’s food.\nWe find it bitter, and not tasty.\nIt may not be suitable for you, but it is suitable for nature.\nIf you feel bad for the insect because its home is the neem tree and its food is bitter…\nAnd thus place it in sugar water, it will be killed!\nThat is its quality.\nIt is doing its work based on its quality.\nYou should also know your innate nature and do your work.\nThe nature of a fish is to be in water.\nIf you say that milk is more valuable than water, and then put the fish in milk…\nMilk may be more valuable but the fish depends on water.\nWhen you put it in milk, its life will end.\nYou should know your nature and behave accordingly.\nWhat is the nature of a human being?\nThere is a natural network formed around human beings.\nBirth took place in a society, a family, a caste, a religion, a race, a group, a color.\nSimilar to what happened for a neem-feeding insect on a neem tree.\nSimilar to what happened for a tamarind-feeding insect on a tamarind tree.\nSimilar to what happened for a fish in water.\nYou also have a life. Live well.\nThe way they lead their lives in their areas, you should also lead life with that goal.\nThe insect is liberated if it grows properly, by eating neem.\nA fish is liberated if it stays in the water.\nKnow your goal and live here, you will also be liberated.\nWhat is the goal of a human life?\nIt is with great difficulty that one gets a human life.\nWe must recognize the One who is the underlying operator.\nBecause we cannot see Him - we think those like our parents are running our lives.\nHowever, they have also come here like any of us. They also leave the bodies like any of us.\nWe don’t know who is running them and us.\nIn Bhagavad Gita, He said it is He.\n“Because I am the underlying operator, you can only function but not alter anything.”\n“If something needs an amendment, I am the One who needs to do it.”\n“I am the One capable of making any changes, not you.”\nHe does not give anyone the password required to manipulate anything here.\nNowadays, people are saying…\n“Do not share your passcode, account number, etc. to anyone. Keep them secure.”\nIt looks like God knows this very well.\nThat is why, He does not share the password with anyone.\nHe makes the change to things Himself.\nHe says this in chapter 7.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nraso:ham apsu kaunthe:ya ! prabha:smi sasi su:ryayo:ho |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll objects, their qualities, and their nature are all in My control.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou cannot make any change to them.\nIf you make any change, it means you are destroying them.\nOur people are hybridizing and creating new species.\nWe thought it's a great thing.\nScientists are now realizing and voicing that it is not a great thing to do.\nFor a period of time, there was intermixing of two species to make a hybrid variety.\nThe new variety resulted in many ‘desired’ constituents.\nThis is what people believed for some time.\nAfter about 25, 30 or we believe 50 years, they are now saying it is dangerous.\nHowever, by then, it was already corrupted. All of it is gone.\nThey have altered rice this way.\nIt went so far that the rice is now a silky shiny one.\nEarlier, there used to be a variety called krushna katuka, etc.\nPeople who ate that rice were fine.\nPeople started advertising new silky polished rice. It is an expensive variety.\nThey said it is a variety that only wealthy people can afford.\nPeople started eating that.\nTheir bodies also grew big and large.\nLater, it was found that it is a warehouse of diseases.\n“It is all only carbohydrates and no essence. Stop eating it.”\nWhat can we do?\nLet us go back to the original rice.\nGet back to the original breed. Try to secure the original seed.\nUse methods of organic farming and natural farming and produce.\nThat is what we must consume.\nNow aware of the ill effects of silky polished rice, its price has declined.\nThe price of organic rice has doubled or tripled in relation to the silky rice cost.\nIts availability has reached limits. That is when one started to realize.\nThe minute you plan to manipulate something, you spoil it.\nAnd then you spoil yourself also.\nYou are spoiling it and yourself.\n[God]: If I want to do it, I can do it.\nBecause I am the one who made arrangements for everything, I can do it.\nWhat is the most comfortable thing for you to do?\nLeave the responsibility on Me.\nRealize that I am the One indwelling and enabling everything.\nIt is not because of you that things are happening.\nRealize that the result of what is happening is Mine.\nYou are not the recipient of the result.\nYou must remember that you are an instrument.\nWhat He said is simple. He didn’t ask you to stop doing anything.\nHe did not ask you to stop working, or curb your experiences or comforts.\nHe did not ask you to stop earning, or observe extreme fasting.\nadhya:thma che:thasa: mayi sannyasya (with a spiritual mind, surrender to Me)\nGet your mind to think better.\n“I am the One who is supporting everything, administering it. This is all for me. This is all mine.”\nTransform your feeling.\nRealize the truth.\nThis is all that He wants us to understand.\nWhat is the reason for this?\nIt is the mamatha (attachment).\nWhat is the reason for mamatha (attachment)?\nIt is the underlying ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred).\nWhat is the reason for ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred)?\nIt is the karma va:sanas (tendencies of past actions), stored at all levels.\nWhat is the reason for the karma va:sanas (tendencies of past actions)?\nIt is the karma bi:jas (originating seeds of karma).\nHow are these seed holdings taking birth?\nBecause of the effect of rajasic (passionate) and thamasic (ignorant) qualities in the body - which is composed of prakruthi (Nature).\nThere is a quality called satthva (goodness). However, its duration and the time is brief and in the early morning.\nSo, the most dominant qualities are either rajas (passion) or thamas (ignorance).\nWhat if we suppress them both? That’s good, but do they get suppressed easily?\nHow do we know where they are?\nWe don’t know them. We don’t know the relation between them and Nature.\nWe don't know where the resulting karma bi:jas (originating seeds of karma) exist.\nWe don’t know where the resulting mamatha (attachment) and ruchi va:sanas (tendencies of taste)...\nWe can’t see the ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred) resulting from the attitude of doership.\nHow can we control what we can’t see?\nIf we can see an object, we can either destroy it or throw it away.\nWe can do anything of that sort.\nBut, if we can’t see those things…?\nIf it is a thatthva (eternal reality) that is not visible to the eyes, how can we control it?\nThat is why, He said in verse 3.30 –\nIn fact, He said it everywhere in every chapter.\n“They are all in My control. Hence, ask Me. I will make them easy for you.”\nIf an object belongs to someone, that person will be able to tell you how to get it to work.\nAnd it becomes easier for us.\nHowever, if we can ignore that and try to handle it by ourselves, it can become dangerous to us too.\nDon’t get into that trouble.\nDon’t get into the grips of ra:ga (love) and dwe:sha (hatred).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthayo:r na vasam a:gachche:th thau hyasya paripantthinau\nSLOKA MEANING -\nDo not come under their control, for they are your enemies.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSurrender all your actions to Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDon’t give up working. Set aside the attachment with it that you are the doer.\nThat is when I will make it suitable for you.\nThis is what He is saying.\nIf this can build in us, we can achieve everything.\nOtherwise, there is no use for anything we do.\nWe should make proper use of this great opportunity, human life.\nWe should make sure the karma (actions) we do does not bind us.\nWe should attempt to get rid of all the past karmas (actions) with the karma (actions) we do in the current life.\nThis is the wise thing to do. Isn’t it?\nWhat we do now should not bind us and it should become a means to alleviate us from the ties of the past.\nThat is the best way to conduct any activity.\nTo do so, submit the activity to Me. Realize that it is because of Me.\nRemember that I am the One giving the experience.\nThen, I will take care that they don’t trouble you.\nSaying so, Bhagava:n (Lord), Sri Krishna, is taking Arjuna forward in chapter 3.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Who are our real enemies? Where do they ‘live’? How do we recognize them? How should we deal with them? Who are they? Whenever we encounter anything, there is some feeling. “This is ra:ga (liking), or dwe:sha (hatred).” Whatever we think is good for us, we work with it. Otherwise, we try to keep it away. Whatever we think is good for us, we develop love for it. Otherwise, we develop hatred. We hate it if that [which we love] is at a distance. We hate if this [which we hate] gets closer. We feel happy if this is closer. We feel happy if that is farther. These are the primary enemies. Suppress them. Don’t stop working.\nMany people think of ve:da:ntha upade:sa (teachings of Vedic essence) as… Those which teach people to stop working, leave responsibilities, and settle down somewhere far away. That is not right. When someone is doing his work properly, that means he has learned the knowledge of Vedas. One who works that way becomes the real Vedanti (one who understands the Vedas). What does such a person do? He will act without ra:ga (liking) and dwe:sha (hatred) in the work he does.\nDharmaraja, Arjuna’s brother, does not have ra:ga (liking) and dwe:sha (hatred). God did not teach Bhagavad Gita for him. He did not need it. Why? Because he has an equal feeling towards everything. He never developed any hatred for Kauravas. He did not scold them ever. He never praised anyone. He did not have any attachment with them. During exile as well, it seems Dharmaraja never raised his voice toward anyone. Not just that… As always, Kauravas were inclined to always trouble Pandavas. There is always a drive in some people to trouble good people. They were minding their work in the forests for the period of 12 years. They should be left the way they are. But, No! They wanted to trouble them even there. Duryodhana set out with his team to trouble them. On the way, a war broke out between him and a gandharva (celestial musician) named Chitraketu. In the war, Chitraketu defeated Duryodhana. He tied him up to the chariot and was hauling him away. Dharmaraja saw this. He called upon Bhima and asked him to free [Duryodhana]. He said that he was their brother. He [Duryodhana] was the reason for their exile. However, he did not feel happy that he was being hit and punished by someone. Being his cousin, he felt responsible for protecting him. Bhima did not have it in his heart [to protect him]. However, he was called and asked to protect him. “No, no, no!” He said. “He was the reason for all the difficult situations. We should have punished him.” “At least someone is doing it. Let him beat him up more.” Dharmaraja said that’s not right. He continued… If we are fighting among each other out of hatred, we are 5 and they are 100. However, if someone else is against us, we should become 105. Hence, he sent him to control the opponent and release Duryodhana. In fact, if Dharmaraja had dwe:sha (hatred) or… If he was feeling happy that the enemy is going through a hard time… He would not have freed Duryodhana.\nHowever, Duryodhana didn’t have that mindset. Once, he summoned his guru Durvasa and the rest to trouble them when they were in exile minding their work. They [Pandavas] have an akshaya patra (inexhaustible vessel). After they eat, Draupadi takes the last bite and cleans the vessel, then it closes for the day. Duryodhana waited for that moment and then sent Durvasa and 10,000 other sages to them. They were lucky that Sri Krishna was there as their protector… Because they left the responsibility on Him… He said… mayi sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasya (surrendering all actions to Me). They have that mindset towards Him. They have mentally submitted themselves to Him. krishnasrayaha krishnapranaha (those who take refuge in Krishna, those whose life is Krishna). They are the mahaniyas (great beings) who thought Krishna was their everything. That is why He arrived there to protect them. He asked Draupadi for something to eat claiming He was hungry. “What is this game You are playing with me? I am struggling with how to feed them.” “And You are asking this!” He says, “I don’t know. Bring something.” She said, “I washed the akshaya patra (inexhaustible vessel).” He asked her to check if there was at least a leaf remaining. Because He said He wants to see, they found a leaf in it. She was saved because her mother-in-law wasn’t around [for leaving the leaf out when cleaning]! Whether if it was left out from improper cleaning or it appeared because He wished for it – He had that to eat and wished that all the worlds were satiated. All He had was a small piece of a leaf. That’s it. Pandavas did not know how to handle or work with those guests. They didn’t do anything. Draupadi didn’t know. She didn’t do anything. Because Krishna was there… mayi sannyasya (surrendering to Me). Because they left it to Him, He vowed to protect them in the manner suitable to them. It was true that there was some tension that existed temporarily. Durvasa maharshi (great sage) arrived there. He [Dharmaraja] didn’t check whether she had eaten. He asked Durvasa and his entourage to take a bath and come back. He promised them. He [Yudhishthira] should have asked her [Draupadi] first what to do. She would have told him. However, because their responsibility is on Him, despite a small mistake such as this… He managed and made it work out for them. Similarly, He will also definitely help us in our lives so that what we do does not bind us.\nWhat should we do for that? We should renounce the egoistic attitude that we are the only doers for all activities. We should only do our part. We are in the body. Whatever is the dharma (right activity) for the body, do it. We must practice the duty of the body as long as we are in the body. After crossing the body, it’s okay. You can do what is appropriate for that phase. Whilst being in here, it is not appropriate to practice something else. This is what Arjuna must be given clarity on. If you are traveling on a train, there are certain rules for a train that you must follow. As long as you are on the train and the train is on the move, you must behave according to the rules. You cannot wish to swing from one door to another like you would in your house. If you do so, you will not survive [the train journey]. When you are en route, follow the concerned rules. You are on a flight. What should you do? You should practice the concerned rules. However, if you say you will do what you like and open the exit door while it’s in the sky, what happens? You will be blown out. There are certain rules while in the human body. We are in the human body. The appropriate thing to do in this human body is to fulfill the ordained duties. That is karma acharana (practicing karma). When practicing that, there is a process. What is the process? It is to do them while submitting to Him. If you say you don’t want to do that, then prepare for facing the consequences. However, that is not the right way. This is what He wants to teach.\nRaga (liking) and dvesha (hatred). He talked about these earlier in chapter 2. He is now stressing on the topic.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nra:gadve:sha viyukthais thu\nvishaya:n indriyais charan 2.64\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who moves among sense objects with senses free from liking and hatred\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen you are in this nature, you should continue to do all the appropriate activities. However, you should reject what is not necessary and do the appropriate activities. That’s when…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprasa:dam adi gacchathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nattains mental peace\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere will be peace in your mind. Otherwise, that won’t be the case. He said it there. He is reiterating here. Raga (liking) and dvesha (hatred) are your first enemies. Saying so, He is taking Arjuna forward. It is mandatory for a common man as well as a great person to practice karma (action). A common man does it thinking, ‘It is I and for me’. A wise one does it believing, ‘It is God, belongs to God, and for God’. The work is the same for both. That is why greater beings also look like us. They walk with two legs. They see things with two eyes. They eat with their mouths. They talk. There is no difference in the work they do. The difference is in the way they think about the work. That is the only difference between ordinary and great people. Saying so in verse 3.34, Sri Krishna explains the benefit of doing work that way in verse 3.35.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsre:ya:n svadharmo: vigunaha paradharma:th svanushttitha:th |\nsvadharme: nidhanam sre:yaha paradharmo: bha:ya:vahaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is better to perform one's own duty, even imperfectly, than to perfectly perform another's duty. Death in one's own duty is better; another's duty is fraught with danger.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSwadharma (one's own duty) is always beneficial. It may seem like it is faulty but it is not. The fault is with the way we think about it. We should therefore learn how to perceive it. Paradharma (another's duty) may seem easier, better and beneficial. But still, it’s not suitable for you. Some people study medicine for almost 20 years. And then jump into computer science. We don’t know why. Some study law. And then jump into science. Some educational systems allow that. Not sure if that is okay and how beneficial that is. One expects something when they change their profession. What happens? You have spent time practicing something and then opt out of it. It is unlikely to benefit you. Whatever you have practiced is called swadharma (one's own duty). Whatever you have no practice of is called paradharma (another's duty). Whatever is apt for your state is called swadharma (one's own duty). That which is not is paradharma (another's duty). Don’t get attracted to paradharma (another's duty) and be dragged by it. Despite your swadharma (one's own duty) seeming unbeneficial, don’t give it up. He is taking this forward giving clarity between swadharma (one's own duty) and paradharma (another's duty). Let’s explore further.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We hear from some dha:rmik (righteous) people, advocates of righteous living, about swadharma (one's own duty) and paradharma (another's duty). We observe that these words are explained in various definitions. Sri Krishna used these words in Bhagavad Gita.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna explains in verse 3.35 – While explaining about the enemies of one who practices self-effort, He uses these words. “Dear! You cannot achieve things the way you desire.” “The underlying ra:ga (attachment) and dwe:sha (aversion) drive you!” This is what He began with. Despite your determination, you cannot escape, by yourselves, from their effect on you. He explains the reason. The flowing speed of their effect is stronger. No matter how great a person you are and the amount of hard work you do… The power of your efforts is very less. He said, “So, don’t depend on yourself. Depend on Me.”\nWe might say… “What’s all this headache?” “We are the ones who must put in all the hard work.” “And we should believe that He is the One doing it.” “It seems we should be working hard and think that He is the cause for all that’s happening.” “It seems we put in sweat and blood but that result is not for us! It’s for Him.” “What is all this?!” “We will stop doing everything. We will perform dhya:na (meditation).” “We will work on yo:gam (divine union), or atma sakshatkara (self-realization).” There are some people in the world who think this way.\nWhom is He teaching Bhagavad Gita for? It’s not an upadesha (teaching) for someone who can benefit with some kind of employment. It’s for one who desires tattva jnana (knowledge of realities). It’s for one whose perception is tatvik (concerning realities). It’s for one who can think of the soul in this life. It’s for one who wants to move ahead in the journey of improving its state. That is the purpose of this teaching. It’s not for children who are in first and second grade to only read the verses. It’s not for such a purpose. Or it’s not meant for any benefit for politicians who work on converting from one religion to another. It’s a teaching that He delivered for the benefit of everyone in the world.\nIs it right for a person to work or to quit? What is the right thing to do between the two? You are in a body. The body is a tool that is made for working. When you are in the body, how can not using it become the right thing to do? You should use it properly. You should learn about the challenges while using it and then use it. It’s wrong to say you won’t even use it. In that case, you won’t be fit to be in it. There will be something after leaving this body. But you should not do that while you are in the body. You can do so after leaving [this body].\nSome people say Vedanta (the conclusion from Vedas) is that the world is all a dream. How do you know that? “Yes, it is a dream. It is temporary. It is like a bubble. We should come out of that dream.” Who says this? One who is in the dream cannot say that it is a dream. The speaker is the one who has come out of the so-called dream. However, you say there is nothing but a dream. Then, what are they saying? If you say that the one who is in the dream is speaking about the non-existence of the world… Then, whatever he is saying is also part of the non-existence. He is in a dream and is having another dream! A dream in a dream. How can we trust that as real? How can one think of the world as a dream? Sri Krishna said it is not [a dream]. Upanishads stated that it is not [a dream].\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nya e:shu supthe:shu ja:garthi\nka:mam ka:mam purusho: nirmima:naha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe who is awake in those who sleep, creating desired objects, person by person.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe dreams you have when you sleep are also caused and formed by Someone. Dream is a result of His creation. Why? It is a jagath (world) that is created for you to experience some samskaras (tendencies in your mind). The external jagath (world) is created for another set of experiences. That is also real for experiencing certain karmas. This is also real for experiencing certain other karmas. That is for some types of karma. This is for other types of karma. That is swapnika jagath (dream world). This is bahira jagath (external world). That is real. This is real. That is not created by you. This is not created by you. That is created by Him. This is created by Him. That is made for a soul’s experiences. This is also made for a soul’s experiences. This is a set up for experiences at the personal level. The external world is set up for experiences at collective level. He is the doer for both. sa karta (He is the doer). He is the real doer. It is because of Him that both of these were created.\nHow can we say that a dream is asatya (unreal)? Yes, we can call it anityam (temporary), because it is not with you all the time. However, we cannot say it is asatya (unreal). Why? Because there is something resulting from it. “Can something from the dream be seen externally?” No. But, there are some outcomes of a dream. What are the outcomes? After waking up, don’t you tell someone that you dreamt of something? That is one outcome. Don’t you express that you were scared of whatever you dreamt of? That is another outcome. Or do you not express that it was such a beautiful dream and you didn’t even want to wake up. That is one outcome. It may be positive, negative, or passive. It was useful for experiencing something. That is the purpose. It took a form such that you are able to talk about it. That is one purpose. There is no dream without a purpose. You may say, “I could not remember the dream after I woke up but it was so good when I was having it.” It was useful for forgetting. That is one purpose. Whatever may happen because of it, that is the purpose. It is called artha (purpose). It was useful to make an artha (purpose). It became arthakriya:kari (purposeful). Satya (real) is defined as that which is an arthakriya:kari (purposeful). It may not be nitya (permanent).\nA seed is useful for being sown. It gets useful to occupy a certain portion of land. It becomes useful for blowing some air. It becomes useful for taking in some undesired air. It becomes useful for leaves, fruits, and flowers. If it doesn’t, it becomes useful for shedding. It becomes useful for you to wipe off something. Even if it doesn’t solve any of those purposes, it becomes useful to at least be shown as a tree. That is also a purpose. artha (purpose) + kriya: (serve) + ka:ri (useful). arthakriya:karitvam satyatvam (that which was useful to serve a purpose is called satyam). This is what Vedanta shastra (scripture) proves. When you wake up after a dream, aren’t you reacting to it? You might say that you forgot what the dream was. Maybe to say that it was a bad dream or a wonderful dream. Or to say that you didn’t sleep properly because you had a bad dream. Isn’t it useful for those reactions? This is also artha kriya:karitva (being useful to serve a purpose).\nA tree that’s outside wasn’t there before. It’s here now. Hence, we can say that it is not nitya (forever existing). In fact, we can establish nityatvam (eternally existing) to it as well. A dream too! You can say it is not nitya (forever existing). At least, when you were dreaming, it existed. We were the witnesses. It was useful for witnessing. It was useful to talk about. Therefore, it is not nitya (permanent), but satyam (real). It is anitya (temporary), but not asatya (unreal). Similarly, anything you see outside can be called anitya (temporary) because it keeps changing. However, it is not asatya (unreal). There are some purposes. The world outside is not just for one person alone. It is formed for the collection of creatures. We should know this. This is true for anything. Anything will be useful for some purpose. In our life, there is nothing that is not useful without a purpose. Our body is the same way. All the activities done by the body are also the same way. They are formed for serving a purpose. It [body] is formed for a karma anubhava (experiencing past karma). It is the dharma (duty) of the body to be continuously engaged in work.\nsvam (object)\nOne is an object. One is the owner of the object. We use two words to denote them. An object and the owner. An object is called svam (object). God or nature has given us an object [the body]. This is svam (object). Meaning this body is svam (object). The work we do with this body is called dharma (duty). Meaning swadharma (one's own duty). Whatever work we must do whilst in the body is called swadharma (one's own duty). Other than the body is called atma (soul), meaning us. Whatever we must do for us - is called para (different) - different from that of the body. There are some tasks for it. They are its dharma (duty). That is paradharma (another's duty). There are some tasks done for the body. There are some done for the soul. Are you currently with the body or separate from the body? If you are separate from the body, then those tasks are called atma dharmas (duties of the soul). What needs to be done with the body is called sharira dharmas (duties of the body). The body is called svam (object). The work that must be done with it is called swadharma (one's own duty).\nIt is wrong to do paradharma (another's duty) while in the body. Let’s say you are working in an office. If you work somewhere else while being employed here, that’s wrong. You are a citizen of a country. It’s criminal to work as a spy for some other country. While you are in the body, you should work for the body and with the body. That is swadharma (one's own duty). Whatever should be done for atma (soul), which is different from the body, becomes paradharma (another's duty). What needs to be done for atma (soul) is atma sakshatkara (self-realization). When you are in the body, you must practice sharira dharma (ordained duties with the body). With this current body - are you a human, animal, insect, bird, tree, etc.? Let it be any type of body. We should reflect on the human body. We need not think of all other bodies. The others work as they are supposed to. Amongst humans, where do you stand? Depending on the race, group, state, etc., there is work to be done. Observe this and work. That is when it becomes swadharma (one's own duty). If you forget it or do something else, it becomes paradharma (another's duty).\nswadharme: nidhanam sre:yaha (If you feel it's not right for you or even if you lose your life while doing your swadharma, it’s still good for you). However, if you are here and try to practice atma dharma (duty of the soul), that becomes paradharma (another's duty) and is dangerous. Why? This is shreyan (beneficial). While you are here, doing work with it is useful. Even if you claim that you can do that other work better, it is still not right. paradharma:th svanushttitha:th (despite your ability to do it well, it is of no use for you). It is a waste. Bhagavan explained verse 3.35 for giving us clarity on swadharma (one's own duty) and paradharma (another's duty). Let’s learn.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "a:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nJai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIt is always beneficial for a human to perform work suitable to his stage. That is called swadharma (one's own duty). Whatever work done that does not suit his stage is called paradharma (another's duty). There are many stages for a human being. Depending on his birth, one is called a bra:mhana (Brahmin), kshathri:ya (Kshatriya), vaisya (Vaishya), or su:dra (Shudra). They are called with different names. Scriptures declared work that is suitable for each. Should we do those or stop doing those? Some think that all those activities are not necessary. However, remember that we are not allowed to stop doing those activities. When one is a bra:mhin (Brahmin), all the activities assigned for a bra:mhin (Brahmin) must be done first. If you are additionally a social activist, you should do those societal activities along with them. If you are also a businessman, you should do the corresponding activities along with them. However, if you stop doing the activities that came to you from birth and start doing other activities… It is called practicing paradharma (another's duty), activities not for you.\nSometimes, you may not be able to lead life with swadharma a:charana (practicing the activities of our stage). Swadharma (one's own duty) for a bra:mhin (Brahmin) is to learn Ve:das (Vedas), or scriptures, and teach others. Sometimes, he may not be able to sustain life with only that. If he is unable to sustain appropriately, he can resort to additional means. He can practice a kshathriya dharma (duties of a warrior) along with bra:mhana dharma (duties of a Brahmin) - but still not quit the original. While practicing his original dharma (duty), he can add more to it. We know Dro:na:cha:rya (Dronacharya). He is naturally a bra:mhin (Brahmin). So, his duties are to read and teach scriptures. However, he could not take care of his children with that. He was forced to take up kshathriya dharma (duties of a warrior). However, he did not give up the bra:mhana dharma (duties of a Brahmin) that was ordained upon him. To practice kshathriya dharma (duties of a warrior), he had to enter the warfield. If you are unable to support the bodily requirements, then you can add something more to it [swadharma (one's own duty)]. However, you should not quit doing your original duties. This is one aspect we must remember.\nIf you want to sleep while driving a car and want to sleep, how can that work? Why did you get in the car? To drive it. There are cars now with a ‘cruise’ feature. If you set it to cruise with certain miles/hour, it will automatically drive. While it is true that it drives by itself, you still can not fall asleep. It is your responsibility to steer it properly at a turn, or signal, or somewhere else. It takes on some effort from you, yet - you cannot simply set it up and fall asleep. Then, you won’t get up again. You will attain a permanent state of sleep! Your responsibility is to drive the car while you are in it. After you get down from the car, it is up to you if you want to play, eat, sleep, etc. You can decide. However, when you are there to drive the car, your responsibility is to only drive. You must work. Carry out your responsibilities. That is called swadharma (one's own duty).\nIn Bhagavad Gita (Bhagavad Gita), verse 3.35, Sri Krishna says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsre:ya:n svadharmo: vigunaha\nparadharma:th svanushttitha:th\nsvadharme: nidhanam sre:yaha\nparadharmo: bha:ya:vahaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is better to do one's own duty, even if imperfectly, than to do another's duty well. It is better to die in one's own duty; another's duty is dangerous.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSometimes you may feel that it is not a great work. But still… You may say that you will do the other work very well. You may be able to do other activities. But still you are not supposed to do that while ignoring your duty. It is not allowed. You may think that you can do the other activities very well. Still, you are a person made for a specific duty. It is preferable to do it despite having to sacrifice life for it. Why? When you are in a human body, it is right for you to keep doing activities relevant to your stage. You should not quit those activities to seek higher knowledge. This is what He says. It’s not right to quit one’s work and adopt other means. Some people want to try to attain liberation, resorting to other means, while neglecting their ordained responsibilities. In chapter 3, Sri Krishna instructs that this is not right to do.\nThere are some reasons for it. One is that it is easier because he is used to working. The body is formed to work. So, it is comfortable when put to work. Earlier, we alluded that engaging in [required] bodily activities is like the downhill flow of water. Because it is convenient, risk-free, beneficial and God’s instruction. All these [factors] are in it. So, you should work. Because it’s God’s instruction, do your work while submitting it to Him. He said the same in many chapters. thath krurushva madarpanam (do that as an offering to Me) mayi sannyasya (surrendering to Me). He says it in every chapter. Hence, when doing work, don’t do it thinking that you are the doer and it is for you. Jadabharata (Jadabharata) is shown as an example of someone who thought that way. He had to take another birth unnecessarily because of this. Submit to God. Realize that things are happening because of Him. Do your work believing that God is using you as an instrument and is getting work done through the soul and the body. This is nishprama:da (risk-free). Why? When you believe that it is one form of God’s instruction… If there is any error or fault for some reason in the work you do, or if you fell from it… Because you are doing it as His instruction, He will provide an opportunity to resume it properly. If you feel that you are the doer, He will only watch.\nThere is an interesting saying. If you are a bhaktha (devotee), God becomes a prapanna (one who has totally surrendered). If you become a prapanna (one who has totally surrendered), He becomes a bhaktha (devotee). What does this mean? Becoming a devotee or surrendering is something we should be doing. How does God surrender or become a devotee? We may have such a doubt. Acha:rya:s (spiritual teachers) in the lineage said this is wonderful news. What is it? If you are a bhaktha (devotee), God becomes a prapanna (one who has totally surrendered). If you are a prapanna (one who has totally surrendered), He becomes a bhaktha (devotee). What is the summary? What is bhakthi (devotion/holding on)? Bhakthi (devotion/holding on) is to hold onto something. What is prapatthi (surrender/letting go)? Prapatthi (surrender/letting go) is letting go. Simple! There is a long explanation of what that means. Let’s not delve into that now. What we need to remember is… As a devotee, if you make efforts to hold onto something, God becomes prapanna (one who has totally surrendered). Meaning, “Okay, you think you are doing. You are holding onto things. You can protect yourself.” “You are taking on a means. Then, I will watch.” He stays passive, leaving [everything to you]. Letting go is called prapatthi (surrender/letting go). Holding onto something is called bhakthi (devotion/holding on). If you are a bhaktha (devotee), then He becomes a prapanna (one who has totally surrendered). Thus, He steps aside. This is also referred to with an example of how a markata kiso:ra (baby monkey) behaves. The baby monkey desires to protect itself by holding onto the mother. The mother monkey lets go of the responsibility, i.e. protecting the baby.\nHowever, if you become a prapranna (one who has surrendered)… Meaning, if you believe that you are not the doer and let go saying… ni:vethappa nithaparamberuga! (I do not know anything else but You) ni:ta munchina: pa:la munchina: ni:ve gathi (drown me in water or milk, You are the means). If you can think this way, He becomes a bhaktha (devotee). Meaning, He holds you. This is referred to with an example of a ma:rja:ra kiso:ra (baby cat). When transfering from place to place, a mother cat holds the baby cat even though it knows how to walk. However, a baby monkey is not that way. It makes an effort for its own protection. The baby cat depends on the mother. So, the mother holds on to it. So, should God hold you? Or should you hold God? You should not be the one holding God. What strength do we have? What skill do we have? What knowledge do we have? If we think we are holding God, we are set for destruction. If we leave the responsibility to Him, and allow Him to grace us… Yes. He will take the ownership of protecting and saving you. He becomes a bhaktha (devotee). This is a beautiful process. If you say, “You don’t need to be bhaktha (devotee) or prapranna (one who has surrendered). I won’t be a bhaktha (devotee) or prapanna (one who has totally surrendered).”... “I will take care of myself.” Yet, God is showing proper direction even in that case. He says to at least adopt an easier path and walk it. If you want to walk by yourself, do it. However, at least know the path. If we want to walk in an unknown path, it's good for us to receive guidance from someone who is familiar with it. Is there a pit, or quicksand, or stones somewhere along the way? He explains all this. That will let you reach the destination easily. This is what God does.\nYou are in a body. It is made with certain rules. We talked about this earlier. A cat’s body and a human body are both bodies. But a cat, with eyes, can see at night. Whereas a human, with eyes, cannot see unless there is light. There is a substance called opium. It is a dark drug. If a human being takes it, it causes drowsiness. However, if it is given to a cat, it causes hyperactiveness. It is the same substance. However, the structure of the body is different. It works in different ways for the two. The same goes for human beings. Every human being is unique by nature. One is not the same as the other. We should remember this. Everyone who is educated knows this. However, when arguing, some claim ‘Aren’t we all the same? We all have blood running in our veins, etc.?’ No. Every individual is unique by oneself. There are some common things and some specific things. The common thing for everyone is to work. Do it. Realize your body, group, stage in life, race, country, and situation in your place. Work according to all of them. This is called swadharma (one's own duty). Not doing these becomes paradharma (another's duty). For a thatthva ve:ttha (one knowledgeable in realities)… It is his swadharma (one's own duty) to do karma yo:ga anushta:n (practicing karma yoga). If he renounces karma yo:ga (path of action) and resorts to jna:na yo:ga (path of knowledge) or ra:ja yo:ga (path of meditation/royal yoga), that is paradharma (another's duty). paradharmo: bhaya:vahaha swadharme: nidhanam sre:yaha (Another's duty is dangerous; it is better to die in one's own duty). So, do your work properly. Do it knowing that you are working for the Lord. This way is always beneficial. This is what He explained so far through verse 3.35.\nAfter this, Arjuna asked a question. Sri Krishna! What you said is really good. I want to follow what you said too. However, as if I am being pushed by a certain bhu:tha (evil power)… I am drawn toward something that I don’t like, or not capable of or not appropriate. Who is that pushing me from behind? This is the question that rose in Arjuna. We have many great thoughts. However, at the end, like a dog’s tail that curves back up, we want to do the same wrong deed. Who is it pushing us from behind? [Arjuna to Krishna]: “I don’t think you will push me like that.” “I know You are the great One. I know that I am in a body and that I should practice karma yo:ga (path of action).” “What is the power that is leading me toward bad deeds in this prakruthi (material nature)?” “What is it? Please tell me.” He asked in verse 3.36. Giving an answer to this, Sri Krishna closes this chapter. Let’s continue to learn.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIn Chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna asked Krishna a question: \"Who is behind me, making me commit all the sins?\"\nFirstly, what are sins? How does something I do become a sin? Sins are those where I violate Your instructions. Sins are only those that I do against Your wish. Sin is not a special activity. An activity by itself does not become a virtue or a sin. Any activity that is done as per His instruction is punya (virtue). Any activity that is done which is against His will is papa (sin).\n`yatvath priyam thadiyah punyam apunyamanyath` (whatever is dear to Him is virtue, anything else is not virtue), says the great Kuresha. Whatever is in alignment with God’s instruction, that is punyam (virtue). Whatever is not in alignment with God’s instruction, that is papa (sin). You may like or dislike something. He does not have anything to do with that.\nWhen needed within a nation’s military, a soldier must shoot if he is instructed to do so. He need not say that it is ‘papa’ (sin) to kill someone. He will not get punished for shooting. If a common man hits someone, the person gets punished [by law] and gets sent to jail. However, if someone serving in the military attacks traitors as necessary, he gets felicitated with various awards like chakra, vira chakra, parama chakra, etc. (Awards in the Indian Army). He gets promoted but does not get punished. He becomes a punyatma (soul with virtues).\nOne may feel, “How can the act of killing become a punya (virtue)?” The task he signed up for is such. He has been given diksha (initiation/vow), enrolled for protecting the nation. So, that is what he should be doing. Hence, it does not become a mistake. As long as someone is doing what they are supposed to be doing based on their job, it does not become a mistake or a sin.\n“We should not hit anyone.” “We should protect everyone.” Thinking so, if someone hosts and takes care of an enemy during war, believing it to be punya (virtue), the enemy will take his life. That is one person’s life but he would be allowing entry to someone who puts the entire nation at risk. He would become the cause for it. So, if he thinks of letting go of the enemy, he would be committing a dangerous sin. If he could bring the enemy into restraint, he would be doing a great punya (virtue). So, do we say killing is a sin or a virtue? Wise people decide if something is a sin or a virtue depending on the person and the situation.\nArjuna is in a similar situation. “Take part in the war.” `tasmat yujyasva vigata jvaraha` (therefore, fight without fever/sorrow). He said this earlier as well. “Wage war. That is good for you.” “How can I take part in the war?” “I am going to have to kill all of them with my arrows. Isn’t that a horrible sin?” “Won’t I suffer in hell?” “Won’t the system of society get wrecked?” In Chapter 1 and to an extent in Chapter 2, this is how Arjuna began to give a ‘discourse’ on Vedanta! That is not right. What should he do? He should do as per the instructions. What is God’s instruction? Wage war! For him at that time, his responsibility was to wage war. He was in a role of protecting, i.e., a military man. Isn’t that the duty of someone in the military? For someone in agriculture or business, their work is different. However, Arjuna was not in that role. Because he was a soldier, his responsibility was to wage war and kill his enemies. All that you do in that regard is punya (virtue).\n“Sri Krishna, this is right! I understand what You are saying.” “Somehow, I am not able to do it. It is against Your instruction.” “So, it is becoming a sin. What is the force driving me from behind making me commit the sin?”\n`attha ke:na prayuktho::yam pa:pam charathi pu:rushaha` (then by whom is this person driven to commit sin)\n`purusha` (one dwelling in the body, a being). It is not necessary to talk about other beings now. The current context is about human beings. So, let’s take it as human beings. `purusha` or `purusha` (both mean the same).\n`attha ke:na prayukthaha` (driven by whom)\n`anichhannapi` (not wanting to do it at all)\nOne who is standing in the water does not wish to get pushed by the flow. No, but he gets swept away. What is the reason? Generally, when needed, we want to sit quietly. However, right when it is supposed to be quiet, we cough or sneeze or [the phone] rings. Something else needs attention. What all we don’t want to happen, that’s when they all happen. Why? Nobody wants it that way. Who wants to make a mistake? No one. However, mistakes happen.\n`bala:d iva niyo:jithaha` (as if compelled by force)\nHe doesn’t even do it unexpectedly. These things happen as if someone is holding a knife against us if we don’t do them. We are all familiar with this. Early in the morning, if we want to perform japa (chanting) or tapas (austerity) or prayer, etc., the minute we close our eyes, all that we don’t need to think of in the world comes into the frame. What is the cause? What is the main reason for that? This is a wonderful question from Arjuna. What’s the reason for me doing things that are not liked by You? I don’t desire that. I want to act in a way that You like. I came all the way to You. I asked for You as well. I knew that armies were being assembled. I knew that it would mean that there are people on both sides. That is why, despite Duryodhana seeking 10,000 fighters, we felt all that we need is You alone. Thinking that way, we have set forth for the war. I came here. I was holding the bow and arrow. I even drew the string. However, I threw down the arrows as well as the bow. I did not mean this to happen. Then, why did this happen? I stood up to fight with all masculine power. `rathopasthau upavisat` (sat down on the chariot seat). I ended up trembling in retreat. What is that power making me do what I shouldn’t be doing, i.e. that which is against my dutiful responsibilities? This is what his question was.\nSri Krishna is giving a great clarification to that in verse 3.37.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsri: bhagavan uva:cha\nka:ma e:shah kro:dha: e:shaha\nrajo:guna samudbhavaha |\nmaha:sano: maha:pa:pma:\nviddhye:nam iha vairinam ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe Blessed Lord said:\nIt is desire, it is anger, born from the quality of passion (rajoguna).\nIt is a great devourer, a great sinner. Know this to be the enemy here.\n-----------------------------------------------\n`vairi` (enemy). He is a powerful enemy. Who? `kama eshaha krodha eshaha` (this is desire, this is anger). He is named kama (desire) and he is named krodha (anger). Where did these two come from? `rajoguna samudbhavaha` (born from the quality of passion). They are two children born to rajoguna (the quality of passion). They look like children but their behavior is dangerous. Mosquitoes are very tiny but their behavior is unbearable and dangerous.\nWho is this kama (desire)? Who is this krodha (anger)? `kama eshaha krodha eshaha` (this is desire, this is anger). He is called kama (desire). The other is krodha (anger). Where did the two come from? `rajoguna samudbhavaha` (born from the quality of passion). They are two kids born to rajoguna (the quality of passion). They are kids but they look like thunderbolts. What do they do? One is named `mahasanaha` (great devourer). Another is named `mahapapma` (great sinner). We are saying ‘one’ and ‘another’ but there aren’t two there. It’s just one. What is it? It is `kamaha` (desire). When it gradually matures, or dries, the underlying cause becomes visible. `rajoguna samudbhavaha` (born from the quality of passion). Both originate from rajoguna (the quality of passion). We are again stating them as two in number, but it’s only one. There is a gradual maturation in it.\nWhen a fruit is not ready, it is called unripened. After some time, the fruit becomes ripened. The unripened one and the ripened one - are they the same or different? They’re different - are they? No, they are the same. Are they the same or different? They are the same and they are different. We should know how they are the same, yet different. How can we say they are the same? From the perception of `jati` (class), they are the same. How can we say they are different? Based on the difference in their state. Based on the difference in the form, we say they are different. When do they become different? They don’t exist in the same time-frame. It does not become kama (desire) and krodha (anger) at the same time. At one point in time, it’s love. Later, it matures! Analogous to the unripened and ripened fruit – When unripened, it is `kaya` (raw fruit). The same gradually changes color and becomes `pandu` (a ripened fruit). Then, we changed the name. The same one, due to the change in state, has different names. Similarly, that which is born from rajoguna (the quality of passion) is called kama (desire). The same is called krodha (anger). Even more mature, it is also called `paga` (rivalry). Progressively more, it is called `kasi` (intense hatred). They are all names of the same. Where do they originate from? `rajoguna samudbhavaha` (born from the quality of passion).\nBased on the state, the resulting activity differs. A raw fruit is relatively sour. When it ripens, it becomes sweeter. At a state where it is more raw, it tastes astringent. The same, depending on the change in state, is astringent, sour and in another state, it is sweet. We see these three states. Similarly, being born from rajoguna (the quality of passion), no matter how strong you are, there is one thing that can forcibly push you. What is it? That is kama (desire). When it ‘ripens’ and changes, the same is called krodha (anger). Both are the same. When it is in the state of kama (desire), it is called `mahasana` (a great devourer). A gourmand is always fond of ‘eating’. It is born from Kumbhakarna. Kumbhakarna eats only once in 6 months. However, kama (desire) wants to eat every second! Not only does it want to eat, but as it is fed, the desire gets even deeper. It is never satisfied. We eat. We ate yesterday, the day before, the day before that, the previous year, the year before. We have been eating from our childhood. We have been eating for so long. Can we take a break? Can we decide to not eat for a few days? We can’t. We want to eat more and more. If we are not fed on time, we get so angry that it makes us want to eat the person next to us! Isn’t it amazing? Kama (desire) is simply a gourmand. What about krodha (anger)? It has another quality. It is `mahapapma` (a great sinner). It makes us do every bad thing possible. When its state changes, the repercussions also change. Sri Krishna is explaining these to Arjuna. He is moving us ahead further.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIt is customary for Telugu people to celebrate a baby’s first solid feeding in his/her 6th month. Perhaps, others also celebrate it around the same timeframe. In some countries, they begin from the 4th month. In any case, the substance being fed is prepared to be soft for the baby to get accustomed to. However, the baby is not used to it. Babies are used to having mother’s milk. They won’t want to eat anything else. They keep spitting it out. The mother, for his growth, distracts the baby with things like a bird, dog, hen, or the moon and slowly feeds him. She shows him the surrounding Nature to get him accustomed. In the beginning, he keeps spitting out the food. In fact he spits on the mother’s face many times as well. Yet, she doesn’t get irritated. She continues to feed him with love for sometime. After a while, he gets to a point where he doesn’t know anything else but food.\nEating has to be regularized. For that, you must give the ‘machine’ a break every 15 days. That day is named Ekadasi (a specific day for fasting). There should not be any intake on that day. If you can’t do that, then have some water. If that is difficult, then have some milk or buttermilk. If that is also difficult, then have only one small meal. If that is also difficult, at least reduce your regular meal size. One feels he will get weak. He will not be happy with this after getting used to regular eating. He will want to eat a variety of dishes but will not want to stop. If he gets ill and the doctor advises not to eat something because of the food’s effect on his health… Then he will stop eating those restricted items. Some people have the habit of eating food made of other animals. There are some who will say ‘no way’ without a non-vegetarian portion in the meal. When they develop a cardiac problem, they are advised strictly not to eat non-veg. They are warned that a repeat offense will make it so that they don’t need to visit a doctor, as it will be too late. If they are advised with that level of seriousness, then they stop eating while sulking about it. They don’t want to stop it. However, in the early days, they didn’t even like to or have a desire to eat it. In the world, we all know this to be the case.\nGod named this in Bhagavad Gita as kama (desire). It is very dangerous. There is no satisfaction no matter how much one eats. Kama (desire) keeps growing with more eating. When one lives normally, he lives that way. However, when living as an elected official, he dives further into this mindset. He wants to keep growing with more positions, including wanting to take over the world. Like Ravanasura (a demon king). We know Ravanasura (a demon king). He did not leave any loka (world/realm). He went to Yamaloka (realm of Yama, god of death), Swargaloka (heavenly realm), and Suryaloka (realm of Surya, the sun god). Finally, he also went to Kshirasagara (ocean of milk) itself. He encountered different types of experiences in each of those places. This is called asa (yearning/hope). There is no end to it. It sustains the fire until that which got it started gets consumed. Generally, we think it cools down if we sprinkle water on it. That’s true. It does get cooled when water is sprinkled. But, if someone adds something else like ghee or petrol, what happens? Shastra (scripture/sacred text) tells us.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna ja:thu ka:mah ka:ma:na:m upabho:ge:na sa:myathi\nka:maha ka:mya:na:m upabho:ge:na na sa:myathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhatever one wishes to satiate a desire with, the desire will never get satiated with that.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat happens?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nhavisha: krishnavarthme:va bhu: e:va abhivardhathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nKrishnavarthma (the name of fire god), the name of agnihotra (fire ritual), place of Lord’s worship via fire. It emits blue and red flames upwards. havisha: bhu:ya e:va abhivardhathe: (it continues rising upwards).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSimilarly, desires are never satiated with what we give to satisfy them. poranaireva khanyathe (they get deeper). If we fill pits on the roads with mud, rocks, or waste, they get filled. At least on the surface, they look as if they’re covered. However, in the case of desires, they get deeper with whatever we use to satisfy them. There is no way that our desires will be satisfied. They will grow from one level to the next, to the next, and next…. Initially, one might refuse to accept an official role. He gets convinced in accepting a small one. Later on, he takes on a higher position. After that, a further higher position. Where is the end? We don’t know. It will continue to grow throughout his life. It will only end with him. Akin to the flame that burns the matchstick that it lights, desire will simply burn him. This is a very surprising aspect. Someone with a sweet tooth will say that he will quit after a gulab jamun or two for the day. He will take a pledge - claiming it is only for today and never again. The next day, he will want to somehow acquire and eat them again. This ghani (deep pit); trushnakhani (deep desire), will continue to build up. People say, trushna na jirna vayameva jirnaha (desires do not get old, we ourselves get old). We get old. The eyes stop functioning. Teeth get lost. The legs wont work. The hearing goes! Yet, trushna (desire/thirst), desires won’t die. They continue to grow and grow. However, the interesting part is for the many things that we develop desire for, the intensity grows for all of those. Like rising fires, they constantly destroy him from all sides. Sri Krishna named this as kama (desire).\nArjuna posed a question in chapter 3, verse 36.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\narjuna uva:cha\nattha ke:na prayuktho::yam\npa:pam charathi pu:rushaha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nArjuna uvacha (Arjuna said): Who is pushing me from behind without my effort? Who is it?! It’s not I. I don’t think it’s You either. Who is pushing me? Not only me, but all the living beings. Who is pushing them all?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSwami answered the question in verse 3.37\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsri: bhagavan uva:cha\nka:ma e:shah kro:dha: e:shaha\nrajo:guna samudbhavaha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSri Bhagavan uvacha (The Blessed Lord said): kama eshaha krodha eshaha (this desire, this anger) rajoguna samudbhavaha (born of the quality of rajas).\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey are two offshoots emerging from the seed of rajoguna (quality of passion/activity). The early phase is called sapling. The next stage is called a small tree. Later it is called a tree. Afterwards, it is called maha vruksha (a large tree). The same one! Similarly, the first one coming out of the seed of rajoguna (quality of passion/activity) is called kama (desire). This will keep growing. After it grows further, it will manifest as anger. One will develop kama (desire) towards something. That desire won’t always be fulfilled. Let’s say he wants to attain some position, he won’t attain it the moment he imagines it. No. Because he won’t, he will be angry with someone else saying they blocked him. He will think that someone is causing him trouble. In fact, no one is troubling him. The one being troubled is he. However, he vents such feelings towards someone who he sees as an easy target. Or he wishes to get rid of that someone who he thinks is the hurdle for his desire being satisfied. The mental tendency of wanting to get rid of that someone is named krodha (anger). If this anger develops further, all good characteristics about the person will appear as bad. It is called irshya (jealousy/envy). This is also a tendency in the mind. These are all changes in jnana (one’s knowledge). If it grows further, irshya (jealousy/envy) manifests into a state where one cannot tolerate the goodness in another person. If it grows even further, every good quality starts to be seen as a sin. He will start scolding him. Despite the other person’s qualities being good, he will begin to scold him. He repeatedly scolds him using whatever horrible language he can use. If it grows further, it becomes like a maha vruksha (a large tree). That will result in the beginning of a physical reaction. Until then, he would stay at a place, but with boiling anger. Until then, he would stay at a place but with irshya (envy). Until then, he would stay at a place but develops asuya (jealousy/malice). Until then, he would begin to scold. After this stage, he won’t want to stay at a place. He gets up, moves around and begins to wrestle and pull the other’s hair, etc.! He will go that far. It will go to the extent of a full fight. It begins to result in physical reaction. All of these emerge from desire. In fact, if there is no desire, none of these will happen. Because of the intensified desire, they reach a state of physical combat with everyone. The underlying cause for it as well, is rajogunam (quality of rajas).\nkama eshaha (This is what is called kama). That is the one driving you from behind. Why did this happen? Because you developed raga (attachment/affection); a sense of favorable experience or love. krodha eshaha (The same manifests into anger). The root cause for both of these is rajoguna (quality of passion/activity). rajoguna samudbhavaha (born of the quality of rajas). Prakriti (Nature/primordial matter), has three qualities: sattva (goodness), rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance). One of them always takes predominance. When sattva (goodness) emerges to the top, rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance) are suppressed. When rajas (passion) emerges to the top, sattva (goodness) and rajas (passion) are suppressed. When tamas (ignorance) emerges to the top, rajas (passion) and sattva (goodness) are suppressed. It is never the case that all three are equally expressed. If that happens, it is the state of pralaya (dissolution/cosmic annihilation). There is always a state of flux. One is higher and another lower. All these are a result of a surge in rajoguna (quality of rajas). Rajoguna (quality of rajas) makes all these emerge from the seed of desire. This is very dangerous. He begins to explain the underlying cause and the process that makes one do all kinds of bad deeds… from verse 3.37 onwards. Let’s continue to listen.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nNature displays different kinds of weather - sunny, rainy, cold/hot, etc. This is the order of Nature. This is not organized by anyone. It is a natural process. In warm weather, young sprouts emerge. In rainy weather, greenery grows. In cold weather, leaves shed. When there is warm weather again, young sprouts re-emerge. This is an eternal process in a cyclic manner. Our bodies are also made of the same nature. Therefore, bodies also have similar characteristics. Whatever is seen all around is at a macro level. Our bodies also undergo the same process at the micro level.\nWhat is the reason for this? In Nature as well, when sattva (goodness) is predominant, young sprouts emerge. When rajas (passion) is predominant, it rains and there are more green leaves. When thamas (ignorance) is predominant, they change color, dry up, and shed. When sattva (goodness) again becomes predominant, young shoots and new leaves sprout. There is a constant flow of sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and thamas (ignorance). Sattva (goodness) brings out goodness from what exists. Rajas (passion) increases udrikthatha (intensity), traction. Thamas (ignorance) changes the form; it brings down what exists and creates opportunity for the new. That is what thamas (ignorance) does.\nRajas (passion) is something that… rajo: ra:ga:thmakam viddhi (know rajas as born of attachment). He says this later in the third shatka (third set of 6 chapters). Rajas (passion) always increases ra:ga (attachment), interest. We use the word anura:ga (deep attachment), passion. There is some object that you have anura:ga (deep attachment) for. You may or may not be able to obtain that object. It can be something that you can or cannot attain. However, because you are not able to obtain the object that you have ra:ga (attachment) for… It doesn’t let you have discretion on whether you have eligibility or not, or whether you have the capability or not. The effect of rajo:guna (quality of passion) increases the bha:va (feeling), the feeling that all is for me and because of me. It increases this bha:va (feeling) in the person. So, when it doesn’t happen, a variety of reactions occur in the person. There will be opposite reactions. Whoever he sees, he will develop anger on that person. That [reaction] is called kro:dha (anger). The initial state is ka:ma (desire).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka:ma e:shaha kro:dha e:shaha\nrajo:guna samudbhavaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis desire, this anger, is born of the quality of passion (rajo:guna).\n-----------------------------------------------\nRajo:guna (quality of passion) gives birth to all this. It results in the ‘movement’ that is the cause for all these pravrutthis (tendencies). “You have to know their qualities. So, let Me tell you the qualities.” maha:sanaha (great consumer). The stage of ka:ma (desire), desire, is maha:sana (great consumer), always wanting to ‘eat’, i.e. consume. The second one is maha:pa:pma (great evil) during the stage of kro:dha (anger). It does not let one discriminate between this and that. It doesn’t hesitate in making one adopt all kinds of evil activity.\nIn Sri:Ra:ma:yana (Ramayana), A:njane:ya Swa:mi (Lord Hanuman) explains the nature of one who is angry. He went to Lanka (Lanka) in search of Mother Sitha (Sita). He found her. He saw the way Ra:vana (Ravana) was talking to Mother Sitha (Sita). He saw how all the demonesses were torturing her. After seeing all this, he became quite upset. Because he is a wise messenger, he knows he should not react impulsively. Therefore, he tolerated it. After Ra:vana:sura (demon Ravana) left and the demonesses fell asleep, he spoke to Mother Sitha (Sita). He gave to Her the insignia from [Ra:ma]. He received hers as well. He properly concealed Her messages [to Ra:ma] in his heart. He thought he would leave but then he didn’t want to leave so suddenly, just like that. So, he thought it would be good to give them a quick warning. He thought it would be appropriate to tell them that he had come and left. He thought about what he should do. Ra:vana:sura (demon Ravana) is fond of Aso:ka Vana (Ashoka Garden), the garden named Aso:ka. Hanuma:n (Hanuman) thought this would be the fastest way to send his message and then leave. He destroyed Aso:kavana (Ashoka Garden). He displayed the might of all his anger upon it. A war broke out. The army commander in chief stepped in. Hanuma:n (Hanuman) killed him. Then, the sons of ministers stepped in. He killed them as well. Ra:vana:sura’s (demon Ravana's) son stepped in too. He killed him too. Finally, Indrajith (Indrajit) came and captured him. He stood Hanuma:n (Hanuman) up in front of Ra:vana:sura (demon Ravana). Hanuma:n (Hanuman) and Ra:vana:sura (demon Ravana) began a dialogue. Hanuma:n (Hanuman) conveyed his message in a direct and straightforward manner. However, when someone’s buddhi (intellect) is not set, good words don’t sink in. When death is awaiting someone about to be hanged, words of good people don’t sink in to them. So, poor Ra:vana:sura (demon Ravana) did not understand anything that Hanuma:n (Hanuman) was telling him. Not only did the message not make sense to him, but he became angry with A:njane:ya (Hanuman). Because monkeys are fond of their tails, Ra:vana (Ravana) ordered that Hanuma:n’s (Hanuman's) be set on fire. Originally, he thought of killing him, but Vibhi:shana (Vibhishana) intervened. So instead, Ra:vana (Ravana) instructed that his tail be set on fire because he [Hanuma:n (Hanuman)] likes it. After that, A:njane:ya’s (Hanuman's) anger strengthened with Ra:vana’s (Ravana's) disagreement and baseless reaction. The intensity of the anger was very high. The tail was lit. Although in the beginning, Hauma:n (Hanuman) felt the heat soon, he felt that it had cooled down. He looked back but it was on fire with rising flames, like the fire in the ocean. However, he was not feeling the heat. That’s good, he thought. I am lit by agniho:thra (sacred fire), fire, but it’s not causing any trouble to me. Therefore, he thought of satisfying it. Fire gets ‘satisfied’ when used for igniting other things, doesn't it? So, he decided to burn down the city of Lanka (Lanka). He flew high and started to set everything on fire. In the end, he set Ra:vana’s (Ravana's) house on fire as well! The entire city was burning as a result of his anger. Anger! Still not pacified. He wanted to burn more. However, he had already burnt so much and had to return before sunset. He wondered if he had enough time or not. Then, he paused and thought it through. He sat on a Mahe:ndra Mountain (Mahendra Mountain) and extinguished the fire by placing his tail in the ocean. He thought about why it didn’t burn him. His mind functioned properly and understood that it was because he is in Ra:maka:rya (Rama's work), the task for Ra:ma. Because he has the grace of Mother Si:tha (Sita). Because his father is Va:yu De:va (Wind God), de:vatha (deity) of air. Because Agniho:thra (Fire God), de:vatha (deity) of fire, is the friend of Va:yu De:vatha (Wind God). He imagined all these as reasons, but ultimately realized that it was only due to the grace of Mother Si:tha (Sita). Suddenly, he was shaken by the thought of whether Mother Si:tha (Sita) was also consumed by the fire! He felt bad for not even considering it earlier. That’s when he says anger reduces one’s discriminatory ability. It will not let you discriminate between… yuktha: and ayuktha: (right and wrong), kruthya and akruthya (what should be done and what shouldn’t), pu:jya and apu:jya (worshippable and not worshippable), arha and anarha (qualified and unqualified).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkrutthaha pa:pam na kurya:th kaha\nkrutthaha hanya:th guru:napi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhat sin would an angry person not commit? An angry person would even kill teachers.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere is no bad deed that an angry person won’t do. He does so many bad things, including not caring for father, mother, teacher, or God. Not this nor that; he will not think again to bring down anyone. That is what an angry person does. He blamed himself for believing that he was a wise person. “Everyone said I am an…” dushkaram kruthva (achiever of great tasks). “I believed in it and was proud of myself.” “I didn’t think of this simple thing.” “I was setting everything on fire without a sense of what would happen to Mother!” “What should I have done?” Anger is natural. Every being is subject to it. Even more so a human being. But, what should one do with the anger? Like a snake sloughs off its skin and accepts a new covering… Similarly, people should be able to shed anger like a snake sloughs its skin. “I know this. Yet, I forgot right vs. wrong when anger came upon me.” “Such a horrible element this anger is!” He understood the intensity of anger at that point in time. krutthaha pa:pam na kurya:th kaha (What sin would an angry person not commit?). Is there any sin that he won’t commit? That is why, Krishna gave a specific name to anger. He named ka:ma (desire) as maha:sanaha (great consumer)! He named kro:dha (anger) as maha:pa:pma (great evil)! Kro:dha (anger) is maha:pa:pma (great evil); it makes you do all kinds of wrong acts.\n“Thus, look at what you are doing.” “I brought you to this position, to this war.” “I protected your family all through twelve (exile) + one (incognito) = thirteen years!” “I have been protecting you like an eyelid protects the eye.” “Don’t you think I will protect you now?” “You are not thinking this to be the case.” You are thinking that you are the one killing them. That you are the one fighting the war. That you are the one killing all of them. That you are the one attaining victory. Or that you are the one reaching swarga (heaven). Or that you are the one going to naraka (hell). Or that you are the one causing the downfall of ancestors from celestial worlds to lower ones. Or that you are the sinner for all of that, as if you were the one elevating them in the first place. You are saying you have killed so many so far; that you are going to be killing many more. As if all of this is in your hands?! As if the whole world is in your hands?! As if the Sun is rising because of you?! As if the sun and moon and the directions are all set by you?! As if the moon is waxing and waning because of you? The moon’s movement because of you?! As if the wind blows because of you, and the trees are growing because of you!? And the birds are all flying because of you! Oh! This is maha:pa:pma (great evil), making you do all kinds of sins! Arjuna (Arjuna)! Realize this. viddhi e:nam iha vairinam (know this as the enemy here). The first and foremost enemy is anger, as well as its underlying desire. They both stem from the same, and therefore, should be referred to as one. This is your first enemy. First of all, distance yourself from this enemy. If you don’t do this and commence anything else, there won’t be any use. Hence, control the effect of ra:ga (attachment), that is a result of rajo:guna (quality of passion). Is that possible? Yes.\nOur ithiha:sas (ancient epics) show two people as the symbols of ka:ma (desire) and kro:dha (anger) each. Ra:vana:sura (demon Ravana) is the symbol of ka:ma (desire). Duryo:dhana (Duryodhana) is the symbol of kro:dha (anger). Know their stories. They and their families. Ra:vana:sura’s (demon Ravana's) family is Kumbhakarna (Kumbhakarna) and Vibhi:shana (Vibhishana). Both are around him. So, both are also forms of ka:ma (desire). The three - Ra:vana (Ravana), Kumbhakarna (Kumbhakarna) and Vibhi:shana (Vibhishana) - are symbols of ka:ma (desire). Duryo:dhana (Duryodhana), his 99 brothers, 1 sister, mother, and father are all a family. The family of kro:dha (anger)! The other is the ka:ma (desire) family. But, you can find good people in both families. We must remember this. Kro:dha (anger) and ka:ma (desire) by themselves are not bad. Ka:mam (desire) and kro:dha (anger) are two shades of bha:va (feelings). No bha:va (feeling) is wrong, but the path leading toward them makes them right or wrong. Ra:vana:sura (demon Ravana) was bad, but his brother Vibhi:shana (Vibhishana) became good. Duryo:dhana (Duryodhana) was bad but his brother Vikarna (Vikarna) was good. Vidura (Vidura) is another good person. Not everyone under the umbrella of Kauravas (Kauravas) is bad. There are some good people as well. There is goodness in kro:dha (anger) also. There is goodness in ka:ma (desire) too. Ka:ma (desire) by itself is not bad. Kro:dha (anger) by itself is not bad. What path do they take? We must observe this. If we do so, we can direct them appropriately. We must remember this. Saying so, Sri Krishna moves us forward in verse 3.37.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\napadām apahartāram dātāram sarva sampadām\nlokābhirāmam śrīrāmam bhūyo bhūyo namāmyaham (I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world).\nWhat makes humans good or bad? God explains this in Bhagavad Gita and tries to direct us appropriately. In chapter 3, verse 3.36, Arjuna asks a question: “Unknowingly, we are impelled to do bad deeds. Who causes this?” Sri Krishna gives the answer for it from verse 3.37 through to the end of chapter 3. He gave a name to it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsri bhagavan uvacha\nkama eshah krodha eshaha\nrajoguna samudbhavaha |\nmahasano mahapapma\nviddhyenam iha vairinam ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe Blessed Lord said: It is desire, it is anger, born of the quality of passion (rajoguna), all-devouring and greatly sinful. Know this to be the enemy here (in this world).\n-----------------------------------------------\nAs long as you are in this body, ‘he’ is your constant enemy. It is said that we must remember that our shadow is always watching us. That shadow which is constantly attached to you, is death.\nnityam sannihito mrityuhu (death is always near)\nAs long as your shadow is projected, remember that death is behind you. We don’t know the value of opportunities afforded to us. We don’t know when death will conquer this body. Because it is your very shadow, you cannot simply lock it away somewhere. Even if you try to lock it up, it will show up next to you as soon as you step out. So, death is always next to you. It can present itself at any moment. As you don’t know when it appears, get ready to face it whenever it comes. Hurry and do what you need to before that time comes. Do all good deeds quickly. Do not use ‘tomorrow’ or ‘later’ as an excuse - do it now. Now! This is what the wise tell us.\nBecause death is always next to us, we must be prepared for it. How? We should know who is the one supporting and controlling it. He is called rajas (passion/activity). Rajas is a quality of Nature. Rajas, sattva (goodness/purity) and tamas (ignorance/inertia), all three, are qualities of Nature. However, they are not always in the same intensity. This is what we must remember. Earlier, we discussed the different seasons - summer, winter, monsoon, etc. If it’s winter, there’s no need to constantly shiver from the cold breeze. It will be followed by the summer season. You should bear it until then. Because it’s summer, we need not think that the heat waves will be eternal. It will rain again as well. Whether it’s sunny, rainy, or cold - we should prepare appropriately. Then, they won’t trouble you and you will be able to withstand those times.\nSame for the body – We also have sattva, rajas and tamas. They always exist. They don’t exist in the same way. Sometimes sattva is predominant - it doesn’t mean that you will always be so sattvic (pure/good). Rajas will also rise. It doesn’t mean one is always always aggressive. Tamas will also rise. These keep changing. Hence, we should prepare for the change. This is very essential. How do we do it? If you have a goal, you will have the strength to tolerate them.\nThere is a couple with two children. They are all hurrying to catch a train. The couple loves their children. So they try to acquiesce to demands, to keep them happy. However, now is the time to urgently catch a train which is on the way. They had to cross a street and the kids' attention was diverted to street-side vendors. The kids kept asking the parents to buy them, crying! When there is no time and the train is about to leave, do the parents focus on anything else? Somehow they control the kids because their goal is to catch the train. They continue to move quickly towards it.\nSimilarly, kama (desire), krodha (anger), ajnana (ignorance); sattva, rajas and tamas continue to rise in us. What should be the goal despite them rising so prominently? We should first realize who is directing from behind the scenes. Accordingly, we should behave. What should we do? When you get angry, you feel like doing something to someone. You should not do that. You will feel like you should do something so that other person will no longer be around. Be careful not to get into that state.\nWhen Ravanasura became angry with Hanuman, his initial instruction was to behead him. But, there was someone named Vibhishana. That is why he heard that it is never right to hurt the messengers. “The messenger only carries the message. The message is sent by someone else.” “The messenger conveys the message as per the instructions of the sender.” “He does not say anything independently.” “So, if you want to convey something, it shouldn’t be to kill the messenger.” “Make one of his body parts unfit and send him away.” Saying so, a person named Vibhishana stopped Ravana from hurting Anjaneya Swami. That is why Ravana instructed only to burn Hanuman’s tail and then let him go. It is ‘Ravana’ who must suggest it but ‘Vibhishana’ must play his role.\nkama eshah krodha eshaha\nrajoguna samudbhavaha\nIt is rajoguna (quality of passion) that gave birth to the two [kama (desire) and krodha (anger)]. However, there is a companion to rajoguna. Vibhishana is next to Ravanasura. Sugriva is next to Vali. Both represent the same - but you should not become Vali, become Sugriva. What should you do for that? You should turn yourself towards Rama. Vibhishana turned towards Rama. Ravanasura had to die and Vibhishana could become the king. Vali met his end while Sugriva took the post of a ruler. At the time of the rise of rajoguna, we must turn towards God.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarvani karmani\nsannyasya adhyatma chetasa |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSurrendering all actions to Me, with your mind fixed on the Self...\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe said so in verse 3.30. Leave it on Me. Don’t put things on you. Leave the bhava (feeling) of ‘you’ in the process. Leave the bhava (feeling) that it is yours. Because I am the underlying One, leave it to Me and I will take care of it. That is why, our people recommend chanting a mantra when anger or desires grow. Those who perform sandhyavandana (daily ritual) everyday chant this mantra:\nkamaokarshin namo namaha kamaokarshit kamah karoti naham karomi kamah karta naham karta kamah karayita naham karayita eshate kama kamaya swaha (desire has done it, not I; desire is the doer, not I; desire is the instigator, not I; to this desire, swaha)\nIt is not I who has done it. It is the effect of rajoguna (quality of passion). The raga (attachment) due to rajoguna developed the desire in me. It is the responsibility of that. It is not my responsibility. Leave it on that.\nkamah karoti, naham karomi, naham karta (the doer is desire, I am not the doer, not I)\neshate swaha kamaya swaha (let the results of it be left to desire)\nSame with krodha (anger). The same is named manyu (vengeance).\nmanyurakarshin namo namaha (anger has done it, not I)\nManyu (anger) made me do this work, not I. It’s not for me. It’s not because of me.\nmanyurakarshit manyuh karoti\nnaham karomi manyuh karta\nnaham karta manyuh karayita\nnaham karayita\neshate manyuh manyave swaha (anger has done it, anger is the doer, not I; anger is the instigator, not I; to this anger, swaha)\nLet all of this be left to anger. One swahakara (offering) is made in the name of anger. One swahakara (offering) is made in the name of desire. Saying so, they are burnt in the fire. It sounds fine but is difficult to do. The intensity of it doesn’t let us be conscious of it. That is why, don’t leave it to anger or desire which are achetana (unconscious and lifeless). “So, leave it with Me because I promised to protect you due to my love for you.” “Bound My feet with that.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarvani karmani\nsannyasya adhyatma chetasa |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSurrendering all actions to Me, with your mind fixed on the Self...\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnirasir nirmamaha\nyudhyasva vigata jvaraha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n...free from hope and possessiveness, fight without any mental distress.\n-----------------------------------------------\nGod says, “With no such issues, move ahead. I will take care!” He names it [krodha (anger)] as mahapapma (great evil) in 3.37. It is a big enemy. It’s a dangerous one. Oh dear! It is not an enemy that will settle down easily. So, you should be very careful with it. We talked about it earlier. Nothing is bad. Neither rajoguna (quality of passion) nor tamoguna (quality of ignorance) are bad. If tamoguna (quality of ignorance) is not in the refuge of God, it becomes bad.\nVali did not seek refuge from Rama. Hence, he had to leave. He was very strong and capable but he had to leave. His own brother Sugriva sought refuge from Rama. In fact, there is not much difference in the both with respect to committing mistakes. Both did not care about Rama. Sugriva was behind Rama with folded hands, lying flat at His feet, until he got the kingdom. Vali was killed and he got the kingdom. Rama was observing chaturmasya (a four-month rainy-season penance) at the mount of Malyavan. Not even once did he come to ask about Rama’s welfare. There is no home and nothing for Him while Sugriva had the kingdom and pleasure. Not one wife, but with two wives too! He was enjoying all the variety of pleasures. Rama was at the hills, feeling extremely low! He was bearing the heat, cold, and rain. We don’t even know if there was any cave. He [Sugriva] could have checked on Him at least once. He forgot. He thought he sought refuge from Rama. Until his desire was fulfilled, he was next to Him. Afterwards, he forgot. That is why, Rama sent Lakshmana to issue a warning!\nyena Vali hatogataha nacha sankuchitah panthahah (the path by which Vali was killed is not closed)\nsamaye tishta Sugriva ma Vali pathamanvagaha (Sugriva, stay on the right path, do not follow Vali's path)\n“Careful. The path that Vali was sent out is still open!” “I know you are his brother, but don’t try to take his route.” “Careful! Whatever route you decided as the right path earlier. It is right to stay the same.” Sugriva was wise. So, he returned. He was able to earn a prayer-worthy state for monkeys!\nSo, kama (desire) is also not a bad thing. If it is attached to God, it’s good. Krodha (anger) is also not a bad thing. If it is used to seek refuge from God, it will turn good. Duryodhana, “Yes! He is a bad person.” Dhritarashtra, “Yes, He is a bad person.” However, Vidura who was with them became ‘prayer-worthy’. He became ‘worship-worthy’. So, no bhava (feeling) is bad. However, which way is it traversing is the question. Even poison is good. If administered in the right way at the right time, it can also save a life. Otherwise, it can be used to end an otherwise healthy life. Any object is not bad. It is the bhava (feeling) of the person using it, that can be bad. It’s not the object that should change, it is the bhava (feeling) that must change. This is the instruction that Sri Krishna is giving in verse 3.37. He is taking us forward detailing its bad conduct further.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nWho is Bhagavad Gita for? Who is this upadesa (teaching) for? Morals, rules, and teachings! Who are these for? They are not for those uninterested. Whoever wishes to learn or wishes to reach an elevated state from their current state, or whoever desires to improve, this teaching is only for such people. Many varieties of objects are presented in the shops on the street for the purpose of selling them. They are not for everyone. They are put up for sale to make them available for those who need them. Same with Bhagavad Gita. Sri Krishna did not teach Bhagavad Gita for everyone. There were many people there. However, he taught it only for Arjuna who had jidnyasa (curiosity). Arjuna wanted to become a better person. He had a feeling that he did not want to go to nether-worlds. He had a quest to find happiness. That is why, there was curiosity in him on whether he should fight in the war or not, or if something is right or wrong. Bhagavad Gita is not necessary for someone of this nature, wanting to live on his own terms. Bhagavad Gita does not work for such a person. It is only for those who wish to become at least somewhat a better person.\nWhat should one do to be that way? What should one do to attain that? Firstly, one should have some knowledge. If one must accomplish a task, one needs some knowledge on the task beforehand. To ride a bicycle, one needs knowledge related to it. To drive a vehicle, one needs knowledge related to it. Any work happens only when the doer has the basic knowledge about it. There is knowledge that one needs post completion of work. There is a different goal for the knowledge that one must have post completion of work. The goal for knowledge one should have before beginning the work is different. The knowledge before beginning the work is about what the work is, how much, how, when, what, etc. Am I eligible or qualified for that work? This is also part of knowledge before beginning the work. There is knowledge post completion of the work. There is also knowledge one should have while the work is going on. Who am I working for? How am I doing it? How should I feel about it when I am doing the work? This is the knowledge one should possess after the work is completed. Initial knowledge is the basic knowledge. The later knowledge is what decides whether he attains the goal or not.\nGenerally, we attain the initial knowledge by learning about it ourselves or through a teacher. Let’s say the task is to shoot a video. We need the basic knowledge of cameras, the lenses, shades, the angles, etc. This is all basic knowledge of how to shoot, whether the head or front or rear, etc. Beginning from how to hold it towards how to capture shots, etc., is all primary basic knowledge. When shooting the video, there is another level of knowledge. Who are we working for? If we are working for an employer, then we understand who is the owner. We think about how to shoot the video as per their instructions, etc. This is the later part of the knowledge.\nArjuna has the initial basic knowledge. He knows who he is, who his family is, who the Kauravas standing on the opposite side of him are, etc. What he did all this time, how much struggle they went through for all the 12 + 1 years. He is aware of all of this. After all this, they came to the battlefield prepared to fight. After seeing the people standing across, he saw them as his relatives and his people. And that they are his teachers. “How can I kill them?” Everyone came prepared for the war. This side and the other side too. That side gathered their army together. This side also got their army together. The preface took place with one level of knowledge. What is the task in hand now? To fight in the war. The related initial activities also were all completed. Conches had been blown. Arrows positioned. He came forward midway. He looked at both sides. With this, he underwent some change in the manas (mind). Something came in between him and the work he is supposed to be doing. What is it? Where did it come from? This is what Arjuna had a question about in chapter 3. He asked Krishna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\narjuna uva:cha\nattha ke:na prayuktho::yam\npa:pam charathi pu:rushaha |\nanichhannapi va:rshne:ya\nbala:d iva niyo:jithaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nArjuna said:\nBy what is a person impelled to commit sin,\neven unwillingly, O Varshneya (Krishna),\nas if by force?\n-----------------------------------------------\nattha ke:na prayukthaha (By what is one impelled?) I did not want to think of quitting war myself. I did not want to think of shedding the bow and arrow. I did not want to think of crumbling down in worry. I did not want to think of becoming weak. Don’t know what it is. Something was compelling me from behind, making me wonder how I can hurt all of these people. Such bhavana (feeling) is rising in me. You are instructing me to take on the responsibility of fighting in the war. However, I am not feeling inspired to do it. What am I feeling motivated for? I am feeling motivated to do something that I am not supposed to be doing. What is the reason for this? This is Arjuna’s question. Sri Krishna is clarifying that.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsri: bhagavan uva:cha\nka:ma e:shah kro:dha: e:shaha\nrajo:guna samudbhavaha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe Blessed Lord said:\nIt is desire, it is anger,\nborn of the quality of passion (rajo-guna).\n-----------------------------------------------\nDear! This is called kama (desire). Kama is a desire that develops in a person. That which drives the desire is called raga (interest). Depending on the rise of qualities in nature, raga keeps flowing in different ways. Our body is made of Nature. We have learnt that each body is the miniature form of the entire Nature. Like Nature goes through various changes, the body also goes through changes. There is udrikthatha (intensity) in nature at times. There is udrikthatha (intensity) in the air, cold, heat, and rain. At times it is very peaceful. Sometimes, it goes into a state of no change, a sleeping state! It is said that the reason is the various dharmas (characteristics) or gunas (qualities). One is sattva (goodness), the second is rajas (passion), and the third is tamas (ignorance). When rajas (passion) is on the rise in nature, it will give rise to several udrikthathas (tractions). When tamas (ignorance) is on the rise, no matter what there is, they all go to a state of sleep. When sattva (goodness) is on the rise, we see a very calm and peaceful state in nature. The same with the body.\nHowever, we are not in control of what rises high and when. Air, rain, heat, cold. When do they all take shape? While there are respective seasons and order in nature, nowadays, we don’t know what happens when. Same with the body. Different pravrutti (tendencies) develop at different times. Why? Because of the differences in the qualities [sattva, rajas, and tamas] within. Whenever rajo-guna (the quality of passion) rises, kama (desire) develops. Earlier, when we had seen an object or met a person, we could have developed liking or disliking. Those are formed as vasana bijas (seeds of imprints) within us. Today, when we see that object or meet that person, we might experience hate or anger. What is the reason for that? It is a vasana (seed) sown from the previous experience with that person or object. It entered us, but is not always apparent. A seed needs water to germinate… There are hundreds, thousands, lakhs, and crores of vasana (imprint) seeds that exist in us. Let’s think that they exist in the form of software. Because you would think that they must occupy some space considering their large number. That’s not the way they exist. They exist in us in the form of knowledge.\nWhenever sattva (goodness) rises in us, sattvic (of goodness) ‘water’ flows. Whenever rajas (passion) rises, rajasic (of passion) ‘water’ flows. Whenever tamas (ignorance) rises, tamasic (of ignorance) ‘water’ flows. When these ‘waters’ flow through them, those respective seeds begin to germinate. When rajas (passion) rises, some imprint seeds begin to germinate. On whatever we developed kama (desire) for, they become active due to the effect of rajo-guna (the quality of passion). When they activate, you tend to think something is right for you, you will want it and attain it. This bhavana (feeling) increases. Sometimes, we know that something is good for us. However, due to the effect of indwelling pravrutti (tendency), we may not have a relation with it. Sometimes, we may know that something is not good for us. However, due to the effect of rajo-guna (the quality of passion), the desire to attain it may grow. It strengthens.\nRajas (passion), tamas (ignorance), and sattva (goodness) are three qualities of the body. They exist naturally with the body. As long as one is in the body, there is no way out of the effects of these. Veda itself says it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnahavai sasi:rasya sathaha priya:priya yo:ho apahathirasthi\nasari:ram va: vasantham priya:priye: na sprusathaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIndeed, for one who is embodied, there is no freedom from likes and dislikes.\nBut for one who is disembodied, likes and dislikes do not touch him.\n-----------------------------------------------\nsasi:rasya sathaha (as long as one is in the body) priya:priya yo:ho apahathi hi asthi (it is impossible to come out of ‘I like this; I don’t like that’). If there is a state without the body, then these may not be affecting him. What does it mean to not have a body? Even after leaving the current body, there will be another body that gets formed for him. What kind of body gets formed is not in one’s control. It depends on the karmic load and the portion of karma that is in the state of maturity. Accordingly, he gets that new body as soon as he leaves the current one. Our people say it’s truna jaluka (like a worm that moves on the grass). It leaves something only after it holds another. If it holds the next, it leaves the previous one. Only after holding onto the next, it leaves the current. Similarly, there must be a new body formed for him before he leaves current body. Only then, he will be able to leave it and enter the other one. This is an eternally ongoing process. The reason for this ongoing process is the seeds of karma vasana bijas (karmic seed imprints). The main one in all of these is kama (desire). The raga (interests/likes) that we have developed. The dvesha (disinterest/dislikes) that we have developed.\nSri Krishna touched on raga (likes) and dvesha (dislikes) earlier in chapter 3. He instructed us not to come under their control. How can we not come under their control? When we are sitting on a floor filled with oil, how can we expect not to get oiled? Similarly, when we are in nature filled with raga (likes) and dvesha (dislikes), how can we stay ‘untouched’ by them? How can we not be entangled in them?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthayo:r na vasam a:gachche:th\nthau hyasya paripantthinau\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne should not come under their sway,\nfor they are indeed one's enemies.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe talked about these earlier, mentioning them as dangerous enemies. It is true. How do we get away from them? How do we liberate ourselves from them? How can we not fall into their control? In the same chapter, verse 30, He gave a means to this: mayi sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasya (surrendering all actions to Me). “If you leave responsibility unto Me and if you behave as per My orders, I will ensure they don’t tie you up and I will take care of you.” We have durahankara (false ego). We think, “Do I need you? Can’t I do it by myself?” No matter how great a person one is, if he thinks that he can do it, it is inevitable for him to be trapped by kama (desire) and krodha (anger).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka:ma e:shah kro:dha: e:shaha\nrajo:guna samudbhavaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is desire, it is anger,\nborn of the quality of passion (rajo-guna).\n-----------------------------------------------\nThese get hyperactive due to the effect of rajo-guna (the quality of passion). They will get you under their control. They will not step back in making you do various kinds of bad activities. Both of them! To describe them, Bharatiya (Indian) literature gave us two histories. We alluded to this earlier. To explain the ill-effect of kama (desire), the great Ramayana scripture emerged. To explain the ill-effect of krodha (anger), the great Mahabharata scripture emerged. Both these scriptures were formed only for the purpose of the two qualities.\nKama (desire) is desire. It is not wrong to have desire for what is appropriate for the person. Sugriva is shown as an example of what trouble one faces when desire is not at the right place. Another example shown is Ravanasura. It was Vali and Sugriva. And another time, it is the three brothers. In the three brothers, Ravanasura is the primary one. His desire was so huge that he wanted the entire world to be in his control. “Anything great in this world must be in my control.” It didn’t matter whose or from where it was. Even if it belongs to God, he wanted to bring it to his control. This is Ravanasura. It is the peak stage of kama (desire). He is an example of how far it can take one. Ravanasura was born in rakshasa jati (demon community). No one becomes bad by community. Whatever community one is in, someone is said to be good or bad based on their pravrutti (behavior). Ravanasura has two brothers: Vibhishana and Kumbhakarna. But, they are dependent on him. The primary responsible role was taken by Ravanasura. Vibhishana tried to tell him hitam (the right thing to do). However, Ravanasura not only paid a deaf ear to hitam (the right thing) but also got into an agitated state, throwing Vibhishana out. Kumbhakarna also suggested hitam (the right thing). He also taught him great morals. However, Ravanasura shouted at him and scolded him. Because he was the younger brother, he felt he should obey him and he did so. Therefore, he also had to get destroyed. Ravanasura and Kumbhakarna got destroyed. The community is good but the nature of the individual soul was bad. Isn’t that what we talked about? Despite being from the same community, Vibhishana understood the ill side of Ravanasura. He understood the qualities of Rama. He realized what is not right for him. He realized that he needs to be on the side of Rama. He left Ravanasura. He reached the abode of Rama. He reached Ramachandra’s abode. So, Vibhishana demonstrated that one’s desire should not be to hurt and capture others. It should be for serving the side of Ramachandra and a society like that of Ramachandra. He said it and he practiced it. What is the result of that? The same Rama threw out Ravanasura and Kumbhakarna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nabhyasiccha lanka:yam\nra:kshase:ndram vibhi:shanam\nkruthakruthya thada: ra:maha\nvijvaraha pramumo:da ha!\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAnd he crowned Vibhishana, the king of the Rakshasas, in Lanka.\nHaving accomplished his task, Rama was then free from anxiety and rejoiced!\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt surprised Valmiki. That’s what it did. He had to be made the king of Lanka. He was crowned. Ramachandra was happy. Vibhishana stood by the principle that one should experience only those which are to their level and stage. That is why he was able to become the king of Lanka. The kingdom was also happy. Think of this body as a Lanka. If it is ruled by Vibhishana who is a Rama dasu (humble servant of Rama), then, Lanka will also be a good kingdom. However, if Lanka becomes captive of Ravana sending away Vibhishana, if it gets to a state where desire outgrows to such a level that goodness gets compromised, then, it [desire] destroys Lanka. What is the result when kama (desire) goes beyond limits while not being attached with God? Sri Ramayanam is a great scripture explaining this moral. Therefore, kama (desire) is a dangerous one. It will make the person go out of his control. A person neck deep into water gets pushed by the flow leaving no room for his intervention. Be aware! That’s how it works on you. Saying so, Sri Krishna explains the swarupa (form) and swabhava (nature) of kama (desire) as the clarification for Arjuna’s question…\nattha ke:na prayukthaha (by what is one impelled?)\nLet’s gradually learn about it.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nThere are internal and external powers that influence people to act. We may or may not yield to the influence from external powers. We may or may not care for them. However, it is impossible not to care for the influence of the internal powers. They draw a person in somehow. Death will not care for whether the person likes it or not. It will not care for whether the person agrees or not, or whether people around accept it or not. It will take away the person on the decided time. Similarly, the internal *pravrutthis* (tendencies) also keep dragging the soul in their path.\n“What is that? How does it take place?” asked Arjuna at the end of chapter 3, Bhagavad Gita.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\narjuna uva:cha\nattha ke:na prayuktho::yam\npa:pam charathi pu:rushaha |\nanichhannapi va:rshne:ya\nbala:d iva niyo:jithaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nArjuna said: O Krishna, by what is a person impelled to commit sin, even unwillingly, as if by force?\n-----------------------------------------------\n“Krishna! Who is it driving from behind the scenes?”\n“He is making me do things that I don’t want to.”\n“No matter how much I want to stop, he forcefully throws us out, holding us at the neck.”\n“What is this?”\nSri Krishna is giving the answer to it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsri: bhagavan uva:cha\nka:ma e:shah kro:dha: e:shaha\nrajo:guna samudbhavaha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe Blessed Lord said: It is desire, it is anger, born of the quality of passion (rajo-guna).\n-----------------------------------------------\nOh dear one! It is called *ka:ma* (desire). *Ka:ma* (desire) which means desire. It is that which is formed because of *ra:ga* (liking), liking for something or someone. If we develop *ra:ga* (liking) towards something, it gradually intensifies and becomes *ka:ma* (desire). If something is becoming an obstacle for that *ka:ma* (desire), it transforms into *kro:dha* (anger). In fact, are *ka:ma* (desire) and *kro:dha* (anger) the same or different? One is a raw fruit and the other is a ripened one. Both are the same, expressed in different forms. Let’s take *ka:ma* (desire) as the fruit that is raw and *kro:dha* (anger) as the same fruit in a ripened state. This is why Sri Krishna uses the singular number when referring to them.\n*ka:ma e:shaha kro:dha e:shaha rajo:guna samudbhavaha |*\n….\n*viddhi e:nam iha vairinam ||*\n*E:nam* (this) is singular. Lord Sri Krishna uses singular everywhere. When we have *ka:ma* (desire) for something, we may not attain it immediately. Or one may not make the effort to get it. *Ka:ma* (desire) never let’s one consider his own lack of effort or his eligibility, etc. The minute he fails in his attempt, he feels that something is blocking him, worthy or not. He will form a negative feeling about that which is obstructing him. “It is obstructing me. It is a hurdle for my happiness.” That mental state of agitation is called *krodha* (anger). If it intensifies further, making him want to harm the other side - it is known as *kasi* (spite). If we are worried that something might obstruct our happiness, it is called *bhaya* (fear). These are all a result of only one thing. That is *ka:ma* (desire). The preceding state is *ra:ga* (liking). Fear is an after-effect. Then comes anger. If that intensifies, it becomes vengeance. It will grow to a level of wanting to destroy the other side. All these are various states of *ka:ma* (desire).\nTherefore, *ka:ma* (desire) and *krodha* (anger)! We alluded earlier that one of the great histories emerged to depict *krodha* (anger). It is called *Bha:ratham* (Mahabharata). People use an idiom called ‘*cha:thabha:ratha*’ (a long story)! This is *krodha* (anger). Duryodhana is symbolic of it. While Ra:vana:sura (demon Ravana) is symbolic of *ka:ma* (desire), Duryodhana is symbolic of *krodha* (anger). If we go through Duryodhana’s character from beginning to end… We will have a proper understanding of the nature of *krodha* (anger), how it grows, how it behaves, etc. Finally, he ends up destroying himself, his family, and everyone who was with him. 11 *akshouhinis* (divisions of army) of the army stood by him. No one was spared. He destroyed even his gurus, grand-parents, brothers, and parents! No question of who it was - completely rooted out. Fire is called *a:srya:sam* (burning the wood that it was holding onto). Similarly, anger also destroys the person who is holding onto it. This is an extensive history. It is called *Bha:ratham* (Mahabharata).\n*ka:ma e:shah kro:dha: e:shaha*\nSo, we should know where both of these come from. Let’s think of them as two offshoots but there is a root for both of them. That root is called *rajo-guna* (quality of passion). We discussed earlier… If we have some experience in the past of seeing, or hearing, or smelling, or tasting something… That creates a *va:sana: bi:ja* (seed of the tendency). It will begin to sprout as soon as ‘waters’ of *rajo-guna* (quality of passion) flow through it. When it germinates, it becomes *ka:ma* (desire). When it gradually ‘grows’, it becomes *krodha* (anger).\n*Ka:ma* (desire) and *krodha* (anger) were shown separately in two different histories. Perhaps, our sages wanted to show them together in one person. Srimad Bhagavatam gives us the history of Kamsa. He is symbolic of *rajo-guna* (quality of passion). *Ka:ma* (desire) and *krodha* (anger) are shown as Cha:nu:ra and Mushtika, two demons growing in his kingdom. We heard stories about the two. They are wrestlers. They can fight very well. They have the muscle power to overthrow anyone. They are *ka:ma* (desire) and *krodha* (anger). We talked about how it is impossible to get out of their control. They are such wrestlers. Where do they grow? They grow under *rajo-guna* (quality of passion), i.e. Kamsa.\nWho is Kamsa? There is a wonderful *dha:thu* (root word) in Sanskrit.\n*kasi sa:sthe:* (he just orders) - a beautiful *dha:thu* (root word).\nHe just orders. He is a dangerous dictator. He does not care for his mother or father. Neither a guru nor his people, or even other people. It doesn't matter who it is, if they stand as a hurdle to his happiness, he will order them and get them killed if needed. We may have heard of some people in history who jailed even their fathers. Aurangajeb is one. He got his father jailed because he felt him as a hurdle to his happiness. He arranged for his brother Da:ra to be stabbed in the back, because he felt him as a hurdle to his happiness. They are all ‘descendants’ of Kamsa. We notice some people like this in history. *Kamsthe: kamsa:the: kamsathe:* (its root in Sanskrit) is its *dha:thuvu* (root word) in Sanskrit. It is part of *ada:di gana* (group of 'a' and others).\nKamsa has two tools, Cha:nu:ra and Mushtika, whom he can instruct. Sri Krishna is very kind-hearted - He wishes for all to be happy. By nature, He has the urge to bestow bliss upon everyone. It did not matter how many wished to follow Krishna’s path. Kamsa is the one who could not tolerate them and wanted to destroy their happiness. The root cause of their happiness is Sri Krishna. So, if He is put away, their happiness gets destroyed. Therefore, he established Sri Krishna as his goal. He tried many ways to get rid of Krishna. He sent Pu:thana.\nHe was the king of Mathura. Let’s take the city of Mathura as our *manas* (mind). The internal tendencies are not visible to us. Great sages of the past wanted to ‘show’ them to us. So, they took the example of a king closest to those [tendencies] and proved that through their life history. In those days, King Kamsa was relatively close and suitable. A *maha:nubha:va* (great person)! Kamsa was ruling the city of Mathura. Nandago:kulam (Nandagokulam) was approx ~9 to 10 km from Mathura. River Yamuna is in between the two. Kamsa was ruling this Mathura. In fact, the actual king was Ugrase:na, his father. Because he did not like his father Ugrase:na’s instruction, he sentenced him to jail. He declared himself as king and he began to rule the kingdom. As he was ruling, he heard that De:vaki’s eighth child would hinder his happiness. Immediately, he put De:vaki and Vasude:va in jail. Later, he started to destroy their children. The history of that episode is not important now, but we are recollecting it as an allegory.\nSri Krishna took birth as the eighth child. As soon as He was born, He left the barred jail and entered Nandago:kula (Nandagokulam) which was on the other side of River Yamuna. That is, He reached Nandavraja and was staying there. An ‘infant girl’ got them to escape from jail to the other side [of River Yamuna]. She gave *darshan* (divine appearance) to Kamsa as Shakthi (divine power) with 16 hands. “Stupid! The One who is going to kill you is already growing up. Beware!” She said so and disappeared from there. He set out on a mission passing an instruction to kill all infants born the month prior. Everyone, sent in different directions, were returning successfully except from one direction. Whoever was sent across Yamuna to Nandavraja were not returning. It was one-way traffic. He sent Pu:thana, no return. He sent Sakata:sura, no return. He sent Thruna:vruttha, no return. No matter whom he sent, they were not returning. “There was someone there. That someone was doing something.” He could have stayed calm until the time was right, however, he could not wait until that Someone came. This is the effect of the intensity within. He wanted to either destroy Him there [at Nandavraja] or destroy Him inviting Him over to his place. That is the effect of *rajo-guna* (quality of passion).\nHe had two wrestlers who depict how *ka:ma* (desire) and *krodha* (anger) behave. He arranged for an event called *dhanurya:ga* (bow sacrifice). He sent Akru:ra to fetch Him. Krishna arrived. He got rid of obstacles in the path and crushed Cha:nu:ra and Mushtika to pulp. In the end, He destroyed *rajo-guna* (quality of passion), i.e its representation, Kamsa. He re-coronated Ugrase:na as the king for that kingdom. Then, Krishna left the place. Why did He do this? Because, there are other people there under His protection. Because Krishna was their very life-force… When Krishna was in ‘difficulty’...the question here is not about whether He feels any pain or loss. When Krishna was under ‘attack’, they felt anxiety. Love for Sri Krishna made them worried. To take away their worry, He must ‘protect’ Himself. To protect Himself, He must get rid of *a:suri: pravrutthi* (evil powers). This is what Krishna did. In fact, they did not alleviate their sorrows. People in Nandavraja did not harm or do anything to Pu:thana, Sakata:sura, and any other demon. They just got scared that something was going to happen to Krishna. They felt anxious and worried. They have complete surrenderance towards Krishna. Because of that, He took away their pain and made their love useful.\nLet’s look at this as our story. Let’s think of *manas* (mind) as the city of Mathura. *Rajas* (the quality of passion), the quality of greedy and dominant nature, rules it. In nature, while there are *sattva* (goodness), *rajas* (passion) and *thamas* (ignorance), what dominates primarily is *rajas* (passion). *Sattva* (goodness) lives in a corner somewhere, almost as if it doesn’t exist. With *thamas* (ignorance), we won’t realize anything. It’s symbolic of ignorance. However, for as long as we have knowledge, the ruler of the kingdom is *rajas* (passion). Kamsa! Kamsa is ruling this. Where does Krishna reside? He resides in the same place as devotees. Nandavraja! The place of happiness - that’s where He resides. There is River Yamuna between the two [Mathura and Nandavraja]. That is the representation of *ka:la* (time). Yamuna, *Ya:mini* (night) - both of these are necessary for life. In our life, we see the night and day. Time! It is like a long river. People in Nandavraja are those who are on the other side of time. They all have great love for Krishna. Wherever people devoted to Lord reside - that is called Nandavraja. Wherever people surrendered to Lord reside - that is called Nandavraja. God resides there happily. Those who cannot tolerate the existence of God, live in Mathura, i.e. where *rajas* (passion) rules. It does not accept [God]. It says there is no one higher than it. It says it can do anything. It challenges why it should bow down to anyone. It says there is no one superior to it. This is the *pravrutthi* (behavior) of *rajo-guna* (quality of passion).\nIn the world, there are both types of people. The effect of *rajo-guna* (quality of passion) in those people make them desire everything for themselves. It makes them want to get rid of anyone who cause any obstacle. He [representation of *rajo-guna* (quality of passion)] has *ka:ma* (desire) and *krodha* (anger) at his disposal. In various ways, he tries to get rid of Krishna. It didn’t work out, right? Similarly, those who cannot tolerate the existence of God try various ways to destroy Him. When *rajo-guna* (quality of passion) reached the peak stage, it invited Krishna to itself. God takes care of *ka:ma* (desire) and *krodha* (anger). He does this for the sake of those who have surrendered to Him. He got rid of both Cha:nu:ra and Mushtika by Himself, to reduce the effect of *rajas* (passion). Finally, He also eliminated *rajas* (passion). He destroyed *rajo-guna* (quality of passion) and placed Ugrase:na there. Ugrase:na is Krishna’s devotee. In fact, Kamsa is his son and Krishna is his nephew. However, the elder one [Ugrase:na] is one who realized the greatness of Krishna. But, Kamsa could not tolerate Him because of the threat to him. This is what *rajo-guna* (quality of passion) does. This is the troublesome state caused by *ka:ma* (desire) and *krodha* (anger). Therefore, our Elders, the great people, encapsulated it beautifully in an ancient scripture called Bhagavatam. The part spans from the time Sri Krishna takes birth through to the time He destroys the danger in Mathura. The purpose is to make us aware of the effect of *ka:ma* (desire) and *krodha* (anger).\nSri Krishna is teaching Arjuna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsri: bhagavan uva:cha\nka:ma e:shah kro:dha: e:shaha\nrajo:guna samudbhavaha |\nmaha:sano: maha:pa:pma:\nviddhi e:nam iha vairinam || 3.37\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe Blessed Lord said: It is desire, it is anger, born of the quality of passion (rajo-guna); it is a great consumer, a great sinner. Know this to be the enemy here.\n-----------------------------------------------\n*Ka:ma* (desire), desire, is our primary enemy. If we want to reduce its effect, what should we do? *Ka:ma* (desire) is not necessarily bad in itself. But, if the tendency of *ka:ma* (desire) is caused by *rajo-guna* (quality of passion), it takes us on the wrong path. *Ka:ma* (desire) means desire. Is desire wrong? If the desire does not walk the proper path, then it becomes wrong. It’s not wrong to desire to eat food. If you can eat properly, it’s good for you. “If it is only for satisfying your hunger, then it is wrong.” He said this in the beginning of this same chapter. Transform the same activity as *yajna* (sacrifice) and make it as *yajna se:sha* (remnants of sacrifice) - and then consume it.\n*yajna sista asinaha santhaha muchyanthe: sarva kilbhishaihi* (those who eat the remnants of sacrifice are freed from all sins)\nWorship the Lord - make an offering to Him and only then consume it. He said, “it is not a mistake then.” What you do with the body is not wrong. Desire is not wrong. If in a state only to satiate the body, then it gradually takes one down the path of destruction. If he can do it with the sense of submission to God, it will uplift him. Earlier, this was likely reinforced within the education system as our *samska:ra* (culture/refinement), early on in life. Our life [every year] starts with consuming a neem flower during *Uga:di* (Ugadi festival). It is a dish made of *shad ruchi* (six tastes) - bitter, sweet, chili, sour, salty, and tangy. However, it is dominated by bitterness. You must savor that as well. What it means is that you may find some experiences suitable or not. Yet… It is essential to experience and tolerate them. They should be for the Lord. To teach this, our people made it a practice to savor this popular neem dish.\nSri Krishna is teaching Arjuna that both these [*ka:ma* (desire) and *krodha* (anger)] emerge from *rajo-guna* (quality of passion). Depending on what form it takes, it behaves accordingly. If it is in the form of *ka:ma* (desire), it is *maha:sanaha* (a great consumer/glutton). If it changes to *krodha* (anger), it is *maha:pa:pma* (a great sinner). If it is in the form of *ka:ma* (desire), one becomes a gourmand. If it is in the form of *krodha* (anger), it lacks discerning ability [of what’s right and wrong]. This is what Sri Krishna explained. We experience these daily in life. Even then, let’s learn from them and move forward.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\n(I repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.)\nSri Krishna describes *kama* (desire) and *krodha* (anger) to Arjuna in Bhagavad Gita, chapter 3. That is, at the end of chapter 3. They (*kama* and *krodha*) are both two states of knowledge in a soul. Knowledge is always flowing, like water. In the effect of *rajo:guna* (quality of passion), knowledge, named *kama* or *krodha* depending on its stage, flows from the root, known as ‘I’ (soul). Both are different flows. Should we stop the flow or let it flow? We talked about this earlier. We should never stop the flow but we should also not let it flow as it wishes.\nKnowledge flows through gates called senses. We know this. Knowledge is released from the *manas* (mind), and then passes out of the body, through the senses. If knowledge emits from the *manas* (mind) via the eyes, it is called sight. If knowledge emits from the *manas* (mind) via the ear, then we call it hearing. When it is passed through different sense organs, the relevant type of knowledge is given to the indwelling soul. This is a flow. Do we let it flow or stop the flow? If we must stop the flow, then we must close all the sense organs. If we close the senses, life ceases to exist. God did not provide sense organs for the sake of shutting them down. He structured them for the purpose of experiencing. However, He arranged them so they should be made to behave the way they should. It is essential for human beings to know how it [knowledge] should flow and how senses should behave. It is not essential for other beings. They behave fine in their life. It is necessary for human beings to know.\nWe should control the flow of water but we should let it flow. Controlling should happen like in a dam. Flowing should happen through canals. Through canals, we can utilize it for agriculture, electricity, and many other needs. The flow of water will then serve as the means for the purpose for all such needs. It will become a tool to make things better. Otherwise, the flow of water will flood the towns. If you let it flow on its own, it will merge into the ocean flooding all the areas on the way. If you try to curb the flow, it will flood areas on the opposite side. We know the nature of the flow of water. To control it, there must be a dam. From it, we must let it flow through the canals as we need. We discussed this earlier. The same goes for our own activities. We should harness them at a dam called Sri Krishna. As per His instruction, we should recognize everything around in Nature as God’s property and thus… We should do whatever service we can to all beings at the level we can, and respond to the needs. This is what we discussed. Instead, if we want to experience saying ‘this is for my happiness, this is because of me,’, then they will turn troublesome. We talked about this as well.\nMainly, there are two forms for the flow that is caused by *rajo:guna* (quality of passion). We learned this as well. One is *kama* (desire) and the other is *krodha* (anger). Ravanasura is a symbol of *kama* (desire). Sugriva as well. Sugriva has *kama* (desire). Vali also has *kama* (desire). Both are symbols of that. However, the *kama* (desire) that Vali has made him want to snatch his brother’s share as well. It also made him forget his owner, Sri Rama. When being opposed, it made him exile Sugriva. Sugriva also has *kama* (desire). However, his *kama* (desire) made him seek Rama’s help. It made him surrender to Rama. Sugriva surrendered to Rama, but Rama made Sugriva his leader. That is Rama’s choice.\nsugri:vam na:tha micchathi\n(He desires Sugriva as his leader)\nRama took him as his leader, but Sugriva surrendered to Rama. In one form, *kama* (desire) fought against Rama. In another form, *kama* (desire) sought refuge in Rama. One who sought Rama became Sugriva, one with a good voice. The second one became Vali, strong and autocratic. Because he became strong and autocratic, he had to be thrown out. Sugriva was made the king. Rama Himself took care of crowning him as the leader of Kishkindha and the Vanara army. *Kama* (desire) is good. When it sought Rama, it turned out to be good. When it turned against Rama, it turned out to be bad. Rama is a role we saw in this *ithiha:sa* (history). In our lives, He is the symbol of *ma:navathva* (humanity). If it goes against humanity and increases selfishness, such desire is bad. We must put an end to it. If it respects humanity… Then, such desire can be made the king of this Kishkindha and the army of *vanaras* (monkeys) can be put under his control. Rama Himself then takes his [Sugriva’s] help. Humanity respects such desire. Therefore, *kama* (desire) is not bad. However, if the channel in which it flows changes it becomes spoiled.\nIn Ramayana, we can see good *kama* (desire) elsewhere as well. In fact, with three people. Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrughna. Lakshmana has so much desire.\naham sarvam karishya:mi\n(I will do everything)\nHis desire is at a level that… As Rama was getting ready to leave, He questioned Lakshmana on what he would do in the forests?\nsarvam karishya:mi\n(I will do everything)\nSuch a great wish. Everything?! He asked, when will you do it?\nja:gruthaha svapathasya\n(awake or sleeping)\nWhatever You need, I will do that. When?\nbhava:nsthu saha vaide:hya: girisa:nushu ramsyathe:\n(You explore the mountains with Mother Sita, I will take care of everything required)\nThat is the *a:sa* (desire). There is no limit to his desire. Our *pu:rva:cha:ryas* (lineage of teachers), explain the desire and longing of Lakshmana as…\nattuso:rum unnave:num, adugiraso:num unnave:num\n(When someone is hungry, he wants to eat everything on his plate no matter what the dish. He will want to eat whatever is getting ready next as well.)\nSimilarly, the desire of Lakshmana Swami to serve Rama is so much that… There is no satisfaction no matter how much he does.\nella:adime:galum seyyaam e:vikkolayum ve:num\n(He wants to serve. He wants to do everything. He wants to do everything that He is instructed to do.)\nThat is how big his desire is. This is also a symbol of *kama* (desire). It is such a wonderful *kama* (desire) that we should strive to earn it, to ‘buy’ it if possible! It’s the *kama* (desire) for God, that is *bhagavad vishayaka* (related to God). That is *sre:yaskara* (that which benefits us). Lakshmana has that *kama* (desire).\nBharatha also has *kama* (desire). He also has a great craving to serve Rama in such intensity. However, Bharatha is a representation of service that is done to please the recipient and not the doer. Bharatha was asked to take the crown as his father died - neither the eldest brother nor the other brothers were present. A kingdom cannot exist without a king. Sage Vasishta and others ordered him to accept it.\nvilala:pa sabha:madhye:\n(sadly, crying out loud, he set forth to bring Rama back)\nHe forced Rama to come back in many ways, but Rama didn’t accept. Because father instructed him to, Rama did not want to come back. However, he promised to return after 14 years, but how could Bharatha work until then? He said he is not the king and requested that he be given something as Rama’s symbol… As per Vasishta’s instruction, Rama gave Bharatha *swarna pa:duka* (his golden footwear). By vesting authority on those *pa:dukas* (footwear), Bharatha also satiated his intense desire to serve Rama. Meaning, one should serve but should serve as per the instruction of the recipient, not as per one’s wish. This is what Bharatha demonstrated. He is also a symbol of *kama* (desire).\nAnother role is Shatrughna. He also has intense *kama* (desire). What did he do with that desire? He became devoted to Bharatha, who belonged to only Rama, following His instructions. We should be in the Lord's service. However, we cannot abandon society thinking that we are serving the Lord. We are not allowed to cut down its priority. Firstly, if we think we are in service to the Lord, we should serve the society that belongs to the Lord. Shatrughna establishes this. All three are symbols of pure desire. This is *udrikthatha* (a drive) rising from *satthva* (goodness). Ravanasura is the symbol for the *udrikthatha* (a drive) rising from *rajas* (passion). In one way, Ravanasura got destroyed because *rajas* (passion) or selfishness became priority. Sugriva is also a symbol of *kama* (desire) influenced by *rajas* (passion), but because he sought refuge of Rama, he became ideal for the world… Whereas Vali was taken down. Lakshmana, Bharatha, and Shatrughna established the nature of *sattva-influenced kama* (desire influenced by goodness). Lakshmana Swami like a shadow for Ramachandra… Bharatha - as *ajna:nuvarthi* (instruction-follower) - irrespective of difficulty or loss… Shatrughna - as the one who acts in accordance to the world that is in line with Rama's instructions and that Rama is happy with. All three have the same quality.\nparava:nasmi\n(we will abide by whatever You instruct)\nthoyi varsha satham sthithe:\n(even if it takes a hundred years)\nIt is the quality of all the three. They are *maha:nubha:vas* (great beings), with *sa:tthvic pravrutthis* (tendencies of goodness). They demonstrate *kama*-like tendencies that way.\nComing to *krodha* (anger)… Vibhishana also has anger, but his anger is influenced by *sattva* (goodness). It was useful in the killing of Ravana. Sugriva also has anger. So, the anger was useful in killing Vali. Lakshmana Swami also has anger but his anger acted upon those he thought would cause harm to Rama. As we approach the end of Ramayana… Bharatha and Shatrughna’s anger killed demons like Lavanasura. Their anger was visible in action when they were eliminating whatever hindered Rama or Rama’s *pravrutthi* (nature) or Rama’s kingdom. We must serve God. It must be applied with everything that is related to God. There must be anger on those that hinder them. *Kama* (desire) is not bad. *Krodha* (anger) is not bad. However, what is their nature?\nOne is *maha:sanaha* (a great eater / gourmand). *Kama* (desire) is a gourmand. There is no satisfaction despite how much it ‘eats’.\naham sarvam\n(everything for me)\nIn the aspect of serving God… [every service opportunity is for me]. In worldly aspects, if it is driven by *rajas* (passion), that is how it acts as well. It is *maha:sanaha* (a great eater / gourmand). No matter how much it ‘eats’, it wants more and more. Sages say,\nna ja:thu ka:ma ka:ma:na:m upabho:ge:na sa:myathi\n(desire is never satisfied by enjoying desired objects)\nhavisha: krushna varthmve:va bhu:ya e:va abhivardhathe:\n(like fire fed with ghee, it only grows more)\nYou desire to have a *ladoo* (sweet). You decide to have it today and give it up starting tomorrow. Because you had one, you will not find it wrong to have two more. Whatever you want to use to satiate a desire, it will only deepen the desire further but not reduce it. We see people with bad habits. They know it's the wrong substance or with the wrong characteristics. They know it’s not appropriate to try it. The desire is not wrong but if the path or its influence is wrong, then it causes various dangers. That is why we talked about the examples. No matter how much it eats, there is no satisfaction. Whatever we want to use for satisfying the desire, it will only deepen the limits of satisfaction. It will act like ghee or petrol, poured on fire. It will intensify the desire further.\n*Ni:thi sa:sthra* (moral principles) in *Panchathanthra* (Panchatantra), say…\nna:gnisthrupsyathi ka:sta:na:m\n(Fire is not satisfied with wooden sticks. It will grow by burning them too.)\nna:paga:na:m maho:dadhihi\n(The great ocean is not satisfied with rivers.)\nGreat volumes of water merge with the ocean, but the ocean never says enough. Crores of gallons flow in it, right?\nna:nthakaha sarva bhu:tha:na:m\n(Yama, the God of death, is not satisfied with all beings.)\nDoes Yama, God of death, ever get satisfied with the number of people he takes? For ages, there have been so many, many leaving the world. We have seen so many [leave] during Coronavirus time. Like Yama, ocean, or fire that is never satisfied, *kama* (desire) also is not satisfied with what it takes. It is *maha:sanaha* (a great eater / gourmand). It is just a gourmand.\n*Krodha* (anger) has a name called *maha:pa:pma* (great sin). There is no sinful activity that *krodha* (anger) spares anyone from. When Anjaneya was in Lanka, he talked about how bad anger is. If anger rises, it does not matter if the person is father, mother, teacher or God - nothing!\nkruddha pa:pam na kurya:th kah kruddhah hanya:th guru:napi\n(Who would not commit sin when angry? An angry person would even kill his teachers.)\nAnjaneya Swami states that an angry person will not revert from killing even the one who is advising him of the right thing. This is the stage of anger. When it is for our own self, anger becomes bad. That is why it is named *maha:pa:pma* (great sin). This [*kama*] is named *maha:sanaha* (a great eater / gourmand). No matter how much one ‘eats’, it won’t be satisfying. Both are dangerous. Both become bad when they are acted upon for themselves. However, if we can use them for God, [it becomes a good thing]. *Alwars* (Alwars) are being worshiped. They also have *kama* (desire). It is *kama* (desire) towards God. Therefore, it is good. The cowherds hated those who hated God. Therefore, that anger also became good. *Kama* (desire) and *krodha* (anger) are not bad by nature. However, if the path they take is bad, they become bad. If they are influenced by *sattva guna* (quality of goodness), they become good. If they are influenced by *rajo: guna* (quality of passion), they become bad. When do they become influenced by *sattva guna* (quality of goodness)? If you seek refuge from God and surrender to Him, they will be influenced by *sattva guna* (quality of goodness). Otherwise, the body will take over everything. So, we should be very careful with *kama* (desire) and *krodha* (anger). This is what Krishna taught Arjuna.\n“How do these surround us?” “Tell me where they exist. I will properly clean them.” That is impossible. To explain how impractical that is, Sri Krishna gives three examples. Generally, He gives one example - but in chapter 3, He gave three.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndhu:me:na:vriyathe: vanhihi yattha::darso: male:na cha |\nyattho:lbe:na:vrutho: garbhaha thattha: the:ne:dam a:vrutham || 3.38\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAs fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, and as an embryo is covered by the womb, so is this world covered by desire.\n-----------------------------------------------\n*idam jagath* (the entire world) *the:na a:vrutham* (conquered by) *kama* (desire). By what?\n*dhu:me:na:vriyathe: vanhihi* (Fire is covered by smoke). Fire is anyway something that burns. Yet, if covered by smoke, it won’t be seen. If covered by *nimuru* (a layer of ash), we won’t be able to see the burning fire inside. There is no way that the fire by itself gets rid of the ash that’s formed as an outer layer. If it needs to be removed, we need to take it out from the exterior.\nThe second one…\n*yattha::darso: male:na cha* (as a mirror is covered by dust). A mirror cannot clean up the layer of dust that covers it. Someone must come to clean it. Both of these have a chance of getting cleaned if someone cleans them.\nHowever, there is one thing that requires no one else to remove it… That is…\n*yattho:lbe:na:vrutho: garbhaha* (as an embryo is covered by the womb). A baby in the womb stays in as its lining holds it as a layer. The baby cannot emerge by removing that layer by itself. At the right time, the uterus lining gives way and the baby comes out. There is a chance that smoke on the fire or the dust on the mirror is cleared by someone else. However, when covered by the lining of the womb, it is only the time that is capable of bringing the baby out. It is not something that can be removed otherwise.\n*thattha: the:ne:dam a:vrutham* (so is this covered by it). *idam jagath* (the entire world) *the:na* (by *kama* (desire)) *a:vrutham* (conquered / covered). Saying so, Krishna explained them. He gave three examples. We need to examine all three - let’s do so.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI repeatedly bow to Sri Rama, who removes all calamities, bestows all wealth, and delights the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhere is the birthplace of desires? Do they originate in a market? Or in substances? Heart or mind? Where do they originate? Where do they exist? Where is their home? Desires are referred to as kama (desire). Where does this kama (desire) exist? What is its form? What does it do? In verse 3.38, Sri Krishna gives three examples to explain this.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndhu:me:na:vriyathe: vanhihi\nyattha::darso: male:na cha |\nyattho:lbe:na:vrutho: garbhaha\nthattha: the:ne:dam a:vrutham || 3.38\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAs fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dirt, and as an embryo is covered by the womb, so is this (knowledge) covered by desire.\n-----------------------------------------------\ndhu:me:na:vriyathe: vanhihi (fire is covered by smoke). At one point in time, fire burns properly. However, when there is an element of water in the wood - which is the source of fire - smoke begins to emit. When there is smoke, fire won’t be visible. When smoke increases, the fire begins to subside. If we want it to burn properly, what should we do? First, [understand that] the smoke emitting originates from the wood. Or after burning for some time, the resulting ash on the surface also originates from the wood. They do not originate externally. That is because of the effect of water within. It does not let the fire burn and emit heat properly. Similarly, because of the effect of water (rajas) that dwells with us, the naturally existing fire (jnana) gets covered by the smoke (kama). This is what Sri Krishna explains.\nWe think it [kama] is caused due to external objects such as perceived by sight, smell, or touch of something external. However, the example God gave is dhuma (smoke). dhu:me:na:vriyathe: vanhihi (fire is covered by smoke). Let us take both the smoke or the ash that’s formed from the burning wood. He spoke of only smoke, but we must also consider the ash on the surface as well. That also does not originate from outside. Smoke is emitted from within along with fire. Ash is also formed from within. Similarly, within us too. We accumulated vasana bijas (seeds of karmic imprints) from the past. Their effect, when ‘moistened’ by rajasic (passionate) ‘water’, releases ‘smoke’ of kama (desire). The smoke of kama (desire) grows and covers the fire. It gradually also forms ash that surfaces over the fire. So, it is not something that can be cleared by itself. How do we remove them? With wind. There should be an external source, a person or wind. Then, the ash gets cleared or the moisture in the wood slowly dries and the fire starts to burn well.\nSimilarly, we need two things to take kama (desire) out of us. One is the upadesa (teachings) of the Wise. Second is the compassion of the Lord. They are external sources. When the wind blows, the surface air becomes clear. Due to the effect of the teachings of the Wise, there is a chance of getting rid of kama (desire) that has conquered one. By practicing God’s instructions as defined in Sasthras (scriptures), there is a chance for the moisture of the indwelling rajoguna’s (quality of passion) effect to get dried. In fact, we discussed earlier that these are inevitable as long as you are in Nature. Body is made of Nature. Because we are in the body, rajas (passion) always exist here. The cause for the formation of the body is vasana bijas (seeds of karmic imprints). We have more than enough of these. So, this is a wet wooden log. Thus, smoke is inevitable. Ash formation on the surface is also inevitable. Therefore, if we want the effect of this to be reduced… The ‘breeze’ of teachings from the Wise is essential. Sasthriya acharan (practicing what scriptures say) is also essential. Sasthras (scriptures) are God’s instructions. Obedience and humility towards God are essential. For as long as we are acting with these two, the indwelling fire burns, i.e. knowledge gradually shines. This is the first example. dhu:me:na:vriyathe: vanhihi (fire is covered by smoke). Just as a wooden log cannot be free [from smoke and ash] by itself, we also cannot be free [from inappropriate desire] by ourselves. Teachings and practicing are those which are graced by the Elders. Now for the second example...\nyattha::darso: male:na cha (just as a mirror by dirt). We clean a mirror neatly. After some time, dust settles on it. We can see it on the surface of the wipe. This is the case even on a very neatly cleaned mirror. “I have shut all the doors and windows in an AC room.” “There is no way for dust to enter. We have done antibacterial procedures, etc.” “Room is pretty much clean.” Even in such places, dust will settle on the surface of the mirror. In the case of fire, smoke and ash formed from within the wood. They have come from within and over-powered the fire. However, the dust settling on the mirror is not created by the mirror. It will settle and cover the mirror. It will also gradually layer up. This is from an external source. Meaning, firstly, there is the chance of doshas (flaws) of desire developing from within. If one practices somehow and is indulged in cleaning those mistakes emerging from within… We are living in Nature, we are amidst Nature wherever we are. Any place prior to reaching river Viraja (celestial river) is all part of Nature, including Brahma Loka (the realm of Brahma). Nature too is made of rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance). No matter what kind of a person one is, the desire rising externally will also overtake him.\nA mirror must show our face properly. Meaning, knowledge must reveal the nature of all objects fully and properly. However, that is not always the case. Why is knowledge not able to make us realize that? Because there is a chance that one gets affected by the doshas (flaws) of kama (desire) from external objects as well. When? That happens only when one feels that one can control them. When one thinks that he is working for himself… When one thinks that he is the ultimate doer, and he is doing this for his own sake… This must change. A mirror cannot clear the dust that settles on it. The dust will remain there for as long as you leave it there. If it needs to be cleared, then there is a need for an external person’s effort. That’s when it can be cleaned. Similarly, if a soul is to be unaffected by the external influences of kama (desire), he will need the same two means. What are the two? One is the teachings of the Wise. Second is the sasthriya acharan (practices as instructed by scriptures). If those two are with him… yattha::darso: male:na cha (just as a mirror by dirt). The dust on the mirror gets cleaned by external means. Similarly, you can get cleansed. “The One who can cleanse is I.” In the same chapter, verse 3.30, He says… mayi sarva:ni karma:ni sannyasya adhya:thma che:thasa: (Mentally, leave the burden of your work on Me). You need not stop doing your karma (activities). He did not ask you to stop doing your work. He did not ask you to stop experiencing things. However, the doership of those experiences must not go along the lines of… “This is all my effort. This is all because of me. This is all for me.” It is this bhavana (feeling) that destroys people. Leave it on Him. Then, He can make sure the ‘mirror’ is clean. The next one…\nyattho:lbe:na:vrutho: garbhaha (just as an embryo is covered by the womb). We talked about how a mirror needs an external source to be cleaned. However, the placenta or womb the baby is attached to or is in, is neither created from within nor formed by an external source. It is a natural formation. The baby cannot break it. It’s not a situation where someone can create a hole in it from outside and get the baby out. Time must bring it to a stage allowing the baby to gradually emerge. This is the case for the womb. Similarly, kama (desire) envelops the soul. We cannot expect it to be removed from within or from someone externally. It requires practice. That should be done by Me. It is a primary enemy. He says this in the next verse.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:vrutham jna:nam e:the:na\njna:ninaha nithyavairina: |\nka:ma ru:pe:na kaunthe:ya!\ndushpu:re:na anale:na cha || 3.39\nSLOKA MEANING -\nO son of Kunti (Arjuna), knowledge is covered by this eternal enemy of the wise, in the form of desire, which is insatiable and like a fire.\n-----------------------------------------------\navrutham jnanam (knowledge is covered). Despite thinking that you are a very great person… ethena jnanam avrutham (knowledge is covered by this). ethena (because of this)… We see in Gita Bhashyas (commentaries on Gita), that many ‘great’ people also were confused on how to describe ethena (this). The great Ramanujacharya Swami shows wonderful scriptural agreement in Gita Bhashyam (commentary on Gita). nithya vairina: kama rupe:na (in the form of desire, the eternal enemy). Kama (desire) is nithya vairi (a constant enemy). It is not enough to think that you handled it once today and can therefore not worry about it. We cannot be assured that everything is okay because we took care of it once. It is a nithya sathru (constant enemy). When does death leave us? When does a shadow leave us? Will shadow ever leave us? No. Just like a shadow is an eternal companion, kama (desire) never leaves us. What does it do? jnanam avruthya thistathi (it covers knowledge). It attacks our jnana (knowledge). What should we do with it? It is dushpura (unfulfillable) and anala (insatiable). He gave two names to it. dushpura (unfulfillable) - it is not something that can be fulfilled. There are certain things we can give to some people and satisfy them. However, there is no way that anything can satisfy this. It is eternally [seeking more]. Kama (desire) is given another name, manmadha (one who agitates the mind). mam madhnathi (it constantly keeps pounding one like a hammer). It dwells within and makes one act. One is dushpura (unfulfillable), not fillable. It is anala (insatiable). ala (enough) means enough. anala (insatiable) means not enough. It never makes you feel enough. Even when one is full and is offered something delicious, he doesn’t refuse. He says, ‘later.’ He would say, “You should have brought it earlier.” He will ask for it to be saved for later in the evening. He won’t say ‘no’. He will not want to say ‘no’. This is the nature of kama (desire). Therefore, it is named anala (insatiable). Anala (insatiable) also means agni (fire). It also means that which is never satisfied. It cannot be ‘filled’. It is a constant enemy. Sri Krishna named it… dushpu:re:na anale:na ka:ma rupe:na kounthe:ya (O Arjuna, in the form of desire, the insatiable fire, the unfulfillable). jnanam avruthyaa thistathi (it covers knowledge).\nCan we say kama (desire) is bad? It is said that there is nothing better than kama (desire). There was a great poet scholar named Amudanar, also called Srirangamrutha Kavi. Eulogizing Ramanuja, he said… semanar vidum porulum tharumamum siryanar kamamum ennivai nangenbar (Dharma (righteous living), artha (wealth), kama (desire), moksha (liberation) are the four objects of human pursuit). Are these four good objects? Yes, all four are good. However, kama (desire) is utthama purushartha (the best object of pursuit). Really? When? When it is directed towards the object that it should be directed to. nanginam kannanukke:a:madu kamam (if one develops desire towards God, there is no better human pursuit than this). aramporul vididarkennurai than (dharma is whatever practice that aligns with that [divine] desire). Artha (wealth) is the supporting means to carry on with [practices]. Moksha (liberation) is the liberation from all other things. Therefore, when kama (desire) is about God, it becomes the best object of pursuit. The other three purusharthas (objects of human pursuit) will support it. This is what Ramanujacharya graced. When kama (desire) grows, it’s called moha (fascination). When fascination intensifies, it’s called vyamoha (deep desire). Ramanujacharya has a great deep desire for something. Do you know what it is? Gold! Isn’t that unfair? He is a sannyasi (one who has renounced), one who has surrendered to the Lord in all respects. How could he have a desire for gold? It’s not the usual gold. It’s gold that won’t get destroyed in any way. He has a great deep desire for the undestroyable gold. It is also called twin-gold. What is that twin-gold? It is explained in a eulogy about Ramanujacharya as follows… yo nithyam achyutha pada:mbuja yugma rukma vya:mo:hathaha (who is always intensely desirous of the twin-gold lotus feet of the imperishable Lord). rukma (gold). yugma rukma (twin-gold). What is it? achyutha pada:mbuja (God’s lotus feet). achytha pada ambuja yugma rukma (the twin-gold lotus feet of the imperishable Lord). If it is the usual gold, there is no sowgandhya (fragrance) and sowkumarya (softness). If it is the usual lotus, there is no permanency. Gold has permanency and radiance. Lotus has beauty, softness, and fragrance. Both such sets of qualities are in those divine feet. Similarly… nithyam (forever). With no break even for half a second… That is why, like mother Lakshmi says she cannot stay away from Lord’s heart… yo nithyam achyutha pada:mbuja yugma rukma vya:mo:hathaha (who is always intensely desirous of the twin-gold lotus feet of the imperishable Lord). Because of the intense deep mad desire… tadithara:ni thruna:ya me:ne: (he considered everything else as a blade of grass). This is also kama (desire) but this is utthama kama (the best desire), the best desire. It is kama (desire) worth having. This is kama (desire) that can be desired for. So, kama (desire) is not wrong. But if it is selfish or against the Lord, it becomes destructive. We always worship alwars (devotee saints). Because the kama (desire) they have is towards the Lord. That is why we always worship them. The state is such that God also runs after their songs.\nWe spoke about Prahlada. He also sought God for a desire. When God appeared in Narasimha Swami avatar (incarnation) and destroyed Hiranyakasipu (a demon king)..., He asked [Prahlada] if he wanted any boon. “Swami, like some people have a craving for sensual pleasures, please grace me with such desire for your divine feet.” “I want that kama (desire).” He wished for it. He became a model for us. So, kama (desire) is good - but if directed away from God, it becomes a constant enemy. It becomes a great enemy. It can cause destruction to the lowest levels in many ways. It will not let you have any ujjivana (upliftment) in life. Hence, it is dushpura (unfulfillable). Don’t say, “I can eliminate it with my efforts. Not to worry, no need for Your help. I am not stupid. I have power and skill.” Don’t we feel like this at times? We are also like Arjuna. We all have immense belief in our strength, knowledge, power, intelligence. With this belief, if we say that we will get everything done… “That is stupidity! That won’t work.” Teaching this in verse 3.39, Sri Krishna further explains… Where does kama (desire) exist? In what ways does it intensify? He proceeds - let us also try to know.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "a:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nJai Srimannarayana!\nPriya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nIf we want crops to grow well, we carefully pluck the weeds that block their growth. To keep our home clean, we block the openings where rodents or flies enter. Sometimes plaque forms on teeth or things get stuck in between causing the mouth to smell bad. If one knows where it's emitting from exactly, one can brush properly and fix the situation. Meaning, if we know the path dirt is taking, we can get rid of it.\nWhere do desires in us originate? Where is the place of kama (desire)? Arjuna did not understand this. Sri Krishna said kama (desire) developing within is very dangerous. Some of it emerges from within and some of it is from outside. What emerges from within activates due to the influence of rajas (passion). It will destroy us. Even a great jnaninaha (knowledgeable person) is not spared; it doesn’t hesitate in destroying even such a person. Sri Krishna explained this in verse 3.39. He also said that it has two names, dushpura (insatiable) and anala (never satisfied).\nArjuna became a bit egoistic. “You said it [kama (desire)] burns everything. I will burn it fully. I will clean it up.” If we know our hair has become dirty, we can properly oil it and then shampoo, or use shikakai (herbal hair wash) and get it fully cleaned. Because we know where it is. Arjuna thought it was within and therefore he could clean it up. Perhaps using a brush, bath powder, shikakai, herbal powder, acid, etc… “Whatever it is, I will clean it up.”\nKrishna: “At least you developed a resolve to get rid of it. That's a great thing. Most people don’t even want to get rid of it. What happens if it’s there or whichever way we are? At least, you have the desire to clean it/eliminate it because it is bad, and it is the [internal] dirt. I am happy about it. I will tell you where all it exists. Try it.”\nArjuna: “Go ahead. I will definitely try.”\nThis is still egoistic. “I will eliminate it. I will eliminate it with my effort.” Both of these are very wrong. What is dangerous is: ‘I’ and ‘My effort.’ It does not happen with our efforts. It is not something that can be eliminated by our efforts. It works as per His instructions. So, it is not such that we can get rid of it by ourselves.\nWe spoke about this earlier. If you enter a new house guarded by dogs and you try to control them, they will tear you apart. It is better if you seek the owner, he will instruct them what to do and how to behave. Similarly, the Nature you are in is akin to a new house. This body, for this soul, is a new home. We entered this. In fact, this is not our home. Our home is there (the higher abode)! We left that place and entered this place. Due to the effect of karma (actions), we got this body. We are staying here for some duration of time. There are guards for this [body] like sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), tamas (ignorance). Additionally, there is the activation and rise of previously acquired vasana bijas (seeds of karmic imprints). Accordingly, the resulting kama (desire), krodha (anger), moha (delusion), lobha (greed), mada (arrogance), matsarya (envy) are like the ambushing dogs. These are nitya shatru (constant enemies) who can attack and suppress even the highly knowledgeable people. We are living amidst them.\nWe have seen many stories from puranas (ancient scriptures) and itihasa (historical accounts), history of great people who had set out to achieve high goals… Performed tapas (penance), but turned away from their goals due to the effect of various desires. We rarely see those great people who have been steadfast with them. Dhruva performed penance only for 6 months before attaining darshan (vision) of Lord. The intensity of penance was so great that God graced him asking what he wanted. He started the penance for a reason. He wanted to sit in his father’s lap, but his step-mother did not let him. No matter what was required of him, he wanted to do that and committed to tapas (penance). However, as he performed the intense penance of 6 months, God appeared and asked what he wanted. Because he was wise, he said…\nkacham vichinvan samavapya ratnam (though looking for a piece of glass, I found a diamond worth crores)\n“I was desiring something temporal but I got You. You are the tattva (ultimate reality), who is not easily accessible even to Brahma or other great souls. I got You. What other desires [can I ask for]?!”\nswamin varam nayache krutardhosmi (I have completed the work I started, I have no other desires)\nBut, can everyone be this way? Will others be this way? History says No. Despite Prahlad being a great devotee, when his grandson Bali Chakravarthi was in trouble, he also worked against God. This puranic (ancient scripture) reference exemplifies how kama’s (desire's) effect can destroy even the greater beings.\n“Whatever it is, you developed a desire for eliminating it, recognizing that it is a bad thing. That’s good! I will explain where it exists. Try it. I must at least tell you where all it lives.”\nVerse 3.40…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nindriya:ni mano: buddhihi asya:ddhi:shtta:nam uchyathe: |\ne:thair vimo:hayathy e:shaha jna:nam a:vruthya de:hinam ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe senses, mind, and intellect are said to be its abode. Through these, it deludes the embodied soul by covering its knowledge.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDehinam (one with a body). This is primarily aimed at human beings. Despite dehinam (one with a body) meaning every being with a body, we will limit this for humans. Dehinam jnanam avrutya (it takes him over, preventing his knowledge from working freely). E:thair vimo:hayathi e:shaha (leads him astray). Because of whom? Indriyani manaha buddhihi (senses, mind, intellect). What are the places of abode for kama (desire)? First - the senses. Manas (mind) is the place where they reside more firmly. Buddhi (intellect) is the place where they reside even more firmly. Asya adhishtanam (these are the places of abode for kama (desire)).\nIn a drainage basin, let’s say dirty water is flowing through. Normal water and the dirt flow together. Filters get fitted at specific points to strain out the dirt. The solid waste gets filtered at those points and the finer water flows. Meaning, one type of waste stops at the filter. Afterwards, partly filtered water flows down. The dirty water that is flowing, one channel further down will have finer dirt. Only the visible dirt stops at the filter. The finer invisible dirt does not get stopped at the top-channel. It comes through the filter. There is more dirt at this [lower] channel and it is more dense than the previous one. Meaning, this dirt is denser. It comes down and flows through the channel below. If there is a setup that can filter it too, then another level of super-fine dirt will still pass through it and stay. Let’s say there is another filter after that [second] channel too. If we clean out any drainage, we end up cleaning the visible waste that gets stopped at the filter. We cannot see the dirt that does not get stopped at the filter. It is ‘high-power’ dirt compared to the earlier one. Whatever gets through it is even more ‘high-power’ dirt. We observe this in the drainage. It is easier to clean the top portion of the dirt. It is harder to clean the dirt at second level. It is even harder to clean the third level of dirt that passes through the second stage filter.\nSimilarly for kama (desire) that gets developed because of the effect of imprints of tastes for objects. Firstly, we experience them through senses. It gets attached to those. Indriyani manaha buddhihi (senses, mind, intellect). These are the places of the abode. Generally, if it is cleaning, washing, or cutting - elimination is done for what is visible. We can see the stick there. We can get a saw and cut it into pieces. We can take a piece away. Are senses visible parts? We know they are there within, and that they are working. However, not a single one is visible. How can we clean them? In what way? When? What you call an eye is a fleshy organ, but it is not chakshurindriya (the sense of sight). It is a door for the flow of chakshurindriya (the sense of sight). Ears are doors for the flow of shravanendriya (the sense of hearing). The nose is a door for the flow of ghranendriya (the sense of smell). They are all parts made of flesh, but not indriyas (senses). That is why they are divided into groups. The visible organs such as hands, legs, and tongue are all called karmendriyas (senses of action). The invisible ones are called jnanendriyas (senses of knowledge). They keep accumulating dirt inside. It gets deposited as finer aspects into deeper levels and piles up. If there is dirt on the skin, we can clean it with soap or other cleanser. If in clothes, we wash them and remove the dirt. But, are senses visible to us? How do we remove the dirt on them? What can we do to control the senses? That is the first place. They tempt one. How do we clean them? To clean them, they must be controlled in their work. How do we do that? If we see certain foods tempting the tongue, we must stop it.\nVishayan indriyaihi charan (indulging the senses with objects). He said this in Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2. If you keep satisfying the senses, they will never listen to you. You can clean them too, but there is a method prescribed for it. What should be done? Indriyaischaran vishayan charan (indulging the senses with objects). Wherever you think there is danger, pull away from it and cage the senses. Then, let them work when necessary. However, if you let them lose, they will not be in a state to listen to you.\nWe discussed two stories. You might remember but let’s review them again. It seems the rat population grew wildly during the reign of King Krishnadevaraya. Rats! What should we do? Can’t do much… But, he called for an inquiry and arranged a commission. How can we eliminate the rats? There are cats that eat rats. What should we do then? “Let us supply one cat for each house.” It’s a good idea. What is the plan to feed the cats? They are brought in to feed on rats - not sure why there is a need to think of nurturing them! Wise ones think that way. To feed the cats, let’s also provide a cow for milk. What about feeding the cow? There must be a farmer. What should the farmer be given to live? ~5 acres of land. If the king wishes, anything will happen. Every house received 5 acres of land. A cow. Wait! One cow is not appropriate. It should be a set of two. So, a pair of cows, and a cat. The king gave 6 months of time. In those 6 months, the cats should not die. Cows should not starve. Farmers should be safe. Deliver the report.\nSix months passed. The enquiry team gathered the update. Cows have grown five-fold. Why? There is 5 acre-land being tilled. The grass is being fed to the cows. The cows are eating well. They are giving milk. The cats are being fed with milk. Cats are growing happily and properly because of being fed with the milk and curd. Rats have grown their families. 1 has become 2, 2 grew into 4, 4 became 16, 16 became 64 and so on. Except in Tenali Ramakrishna’s home. It seems his house did not have rats anymore. What did he do? Cats in his house also are fine. Cows are fine, and the farmer is fine but rats are gone. What did he did? There is not much he did. Normally, he fed cats with cow milk for a couple of days. Cats were happily roaming and were fine. They are playing with rats playing and singing together. Their programs are all going nicely. He thought, if they are all eating everything, then what is there for us? He stopped feeding the cats with milk but cats are not supposed to be starving. So, it shouldn’t look like he denied milk to it. So, what did he do? He boiled milk and brought it to high temperatures. He placed the boiling milk in front of the cat. The cat put its mouth in it and it burnt. The same thing happened the second day too. The same repeated the third day as well. On the fourth day, it got used to running away from anything white in color, out of fear. If it saw milk, it would get scared. But, it should live and so it has to eat. So, it started looking for rats. It would hunt for rats and eat them as food. So, the cat was fine. Tenali Ramakrishna and his kids were having the milk from the cows. The kids were growing healthy. “The cats were growing healthy. Because cats were eating the rats, there were no rats in our home.” “Why are you not feeding the cat with milk?” “What can I do? It is not drinking. No fault of mine because I gave milk to it. It runs away as soon as it sees milk. It is not drinking. It is running after the rats and eating them.” This is what you should do with indriyas (senses). If you give them whatever they want, why will they listen to you? So, if you regulate the way it should be, it will do what it is supposed to.\nThere is another similar story. How should one be regulated? A king had to select and appoint a minister. What should be the process? An elderly person from those times gave a suggestion. “Announce that whoever can feed a goat to its satisfaction, that person will be appointed as minister.” The king announced. “Not your goats, but whoever can satiate our goats will get the position.” Definitely. All the farmers took the goats from the kings’ farm and started feeding them all through the day. By evening, their tummy would grow big and they would return them back. In the evening, the elderly person who was with the king would give them green leaves and they would immediately open their mouths. They [farmers] would be sent back home saying the goats were not satisfied. They failed. The wise Tenali Ramakrishna took up the task. He took the goat in the morning hours. He didn’t tie it up on a farm. He tied it up on a hard floor. He held a hard rope in his hand. He held green leaves in another hand. He would show green leaves, then it would open its mouth. Immediately, he would hit it with the rope. He would again show the leaves to the goat. It would open wide and he would hit. He repeated the same from morning to night. The goat became accustomed to being beaten on seeing green leaves - so, it would simply jump out of fear. It’s stomach caved in. Earlier, those who took the goats, would bring them back with full stomachs. This goat, however, was returned with a swollen face and thin stomach. He returned it to the king. The King asked if the goat was fed. Tenali Ramakrishna replied “Do your test.” As the green leaves came near, the goat immediately untied itself and ran away. It came to a state where it began running away from green leaves all together. This is the state of being in control. Indriyas (senses) do not listen to you if you keep giving them what they want, just like goats. They will continue to keep seeking the same. So, control the senses. Then, give them what is necessary. That is the first process of cleaning.\nHowever, indriyas (senses) are only the first abode for kama (desire). So, indriyas (senses) must be regulated that way. You cannot keep giving them whatever they want. They will never come into your control. Also, you can’t see them. Regardless of how wise one is… vimohayatyenam (tempts and deludes him). No doubt about that. Avrutya tishthati (does not retreat in covering his knowledge). He said indriyas (senses) are the first place of abode. He explained how to control them. One must not stop them from working. However, they must be streamlined and made to work. This is the first place [of kama (desire)]. The next dangerous [place] is manas (mind). An even more dangerous [place] is buddhi (intellect). Kama (desire) settles in those places in a subtle form. Sri Krishna introduces them and explains how to work with them, while reaching the end of chapter 3.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord),\nBhagavad Gita is a great upade:sa granttha (scripture), bestowed by God to mankind. It is not only worth listening to, but also useful to practice. This is Bhagavad Gita.\nAn essential objective goal for humans is to develop nirahanka:ra stthithi (an egoless state). Ahanka:ra (ego) is a quality that mars humans. Ahanka:ra (ego) is named as samsa:ra (cycle of birth and death) by our sages. What does it do?\nana:thman a:thma buddhihi (identifying the non-self as the self)\nasve:svamithi ya: mathihi (thinking what is not mine is mine)\nIt raises these two. It is a natural do:sha (problem) obtained from prakruthi (nature). Whatever is not ‘I’, it makes you feel that it is ‘you’. Whatever is not ‘mine’, you feel that it is ‘yours’. In fact, it is the ji:va (soul) who is ‘I’. But, the ji:va (soul) does not want to self-identify as ‘I’. He wants to know himself as his body.\nBody is a means that he got. It is a tool. Ji:va (soul) got it as a tool to do some work. What is the work to do and how to do it? That is declared by the scriptures. He [soul] is not the tool. If we are holding a pen, we are not the pen. The pen and we are different. We should use it. We should use it appropriately. We don’t need to be suitable for it. Body is also a tool. It is a tool that is obtained to use for our purpose. To make it suitable for us, there are indriyas (senses), manas (mind) and buddhi (intellect). While carefully taking care of them, we should use the tool for our purpose. We should then enter a state where we are not forced again into this cycle of birth and death. We should act in such a way that we need not repeatedly enter the cycle of birth and death. This is the goal.\nHowever, we don’t feel as if we need to reach there. Our natural state is jna:na (knowledge of realities). What does that jna:na (knowledge) say? “There is Someone driving me from behind the scenes.” “I belong to Him. He gave these tools to me so I can take that path.” “I must realize that I belong to Him and do everything as His service.” “As a result, I should reach there.” This is the natural jna:na (knowledge) that he has. But, that is not the jna:na (knowledge) he realizes. What jna:na (knowledge) is he understanding?\nFirstly, he identifies himself as the body. Hence, he identifies as male or female. He assumes age, color, caste, race. Firstly, he is tying himself with the body.\nan:thmani a:thma buddhi (identifying the non-self as the self)\nThe body is not the soul, it is only a tool. So, it is called ana:thma (not the soul). He is thinking ana:thma (body), as a:thma (soul). He is concluding that he is the body. He says, this [the body] is how I am.\nSecond is the jna:na (knowledge of realities). He does not realize that jna:na (knowledge) belongs to him. He thinks that everything related to the body is all his.\nasve:svamithi ya mathihi (thinking what is not mine is mine)\nOnce you think ‘I am the body’, everything related to the body becomes ‘mine’. All the nutrition for the body has become for him. They became the priority for him. He started using his jna:na (knowledge) for their nourishment. Because of that, he is facing a downfall. The ana:thma nischayam (thinking that he is the body), is called samsa:ra (cycle of birth and death). It is that which needs to be shed. It’s not the body nor the surroundings that we must get rid of. The change should come in that nischayam (attitudinal decision). If that happens, the rest becomes straightened out.\nBut, such a difficult change! It is a very hard change. Indriyas (senses) drive you for their happiness. Manas (mind) becomes driven by indriyas (senses). Buddhi (intellect) keeps strengthening the manas (mind). We run behind everything that indriyas (senses) desire. Our mouth wants food. The eyes want a form. Ears want sounds. Body wants touch. We chase them. Indriyas (senses) are chasing them. They are also dragging the manas (mind) with them. In fact, manas (mind) is their leader. It should regulate them as a leader. It becomes delighted with them and follows them.\nA ruler must make efforts to keep the residents happy. He should instruct them with what is right for them. But, in the name of democracy… If they declare that someone or some group is seeking or wanting something, and therefore they do the same… Such governments are in the state of decline. If the indwelling ji:va (soul) makes his manas (mind) run behind satisfying the indriyas (senses)… He will get stuck in a path like falling in a pit of thorns. They are the same.\nIndriyas (senses) may desire various things. But, if you are wise, if you are a jna:ni (knower of truth)… You will first consider whether they are proper or not, worth it or not. If something is not worthy, you must first instruct the manas (mind). Prior to that, you must instruct the buddhi (intellect) that it is not right. If buddhi (intellect) decides, then it will control manas (mind). If manas (mind) is controlled, then it will control indriyas (senses).\nIndriyas (senses) are horses. Horses are kept in control by reins. Reins are controlled by the driver. The charioteer should hold reins and steer the horses. Horses shouldn’t be running wherever they want, taking the reins along with them, followed by the driver. If they are 4 or 5 horses, he will also break into that many pieces. He will get destroyed. Or he will have to leave them all and perish. We know that.\nThere are five senses. Think of them as horses. There is manas (mind). Think of it as reins. There is buddhi (intellect). Think of it as the driver. We are traveling in it. What is it we should do? Whatever is our goal, the driver should steer the vehicle towards that. To enable him to steer that way, he should hold the reins accordingly in his hands. The horses should abide by the reins and run accordingly. If that happens, you will reach the planned destination. Otherwise, if they are running as per their wish… If the reins are with them, then the driver will have no set direction. You will fall somewhere. We know this.\nSamsa:ra (cycle of birth and death) is that buddhi (intellect) which has no control, leading to destruction. What does it do to him?\nsam (whatever are supposed to be looked at separately: horses, reins, path, etc. are seen as the same)\nsar (deciding actions accordingly)\nMeaning, he is getting destroyed in it. The path is good. The horses are well. The reins are strong. The driver is able. You are also good. However, the control is not with you but went under the control of horses. And thus, you will die.\nFirstly, make the driver a proper one. Then, he will hold the reins properly. Then, he will steer the horses properly. The paths will be right. You will be able to reach the destination. So, you should first put indriyas (senses) in control.\nSri Krishna explains this in verse 3.41:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:th thvam indriya:ny a:dau\nniyamya bharatharshabha! |\npa:pma:nam prajahi\njna:na vijna:na na:sanam ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, O best of the Bharatas, first control your senses.\nGive up this sinful desire, which destroys knowledge and discernment.\n-----------------------------------------------\nFirst, put indriyas (senses) in control. Don’t succumb to all their demands. Think of them as animals. Think of all the experiences as plants. You can take the horses to the plants. If these are not the right plants, and they eat them all, leaving nothing remaining… If you can first let the plant grow strong and then take the animals there, you can tie the animal to the tree. There won’t be any problem. The tree will be there as is. The animal will be there independently. You can work by yourself.\nThink of jna:na (knowledge) as the growing plant. Firstly, you must put a good fence around it so the animal doesn’t reach it in its sapling phase. Let it grow. After it grows fully, then take the animal there and tie it to the tree. There will be no problem.\nthasma:th thvam indriya:ny a:dau niyamya (Therefore, you must first regulate the senses)\nFirstly, you must regulate the indriyas (senses). [Regulate] the body through indriyas (senses). Don’t let it go wherever it wants. Pull it back a little. When they are in a stage where they will listen to you, then you can let them travel ahead. To do so, where will you pull them to? Through whom will you pull them back? Can you even reach them? That is why, He asked you to leave that to Him.\nIn the same chapter, verse 3.30…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmayi sarva:ni karma:ni\nsannyasya…\nnira:si:r nirmamo: bhu:thva:\nyudhyasva vigatha jvaraha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSurrendering all actions to Me, with your mind fixed on the Self,\nfree from desire and possessiveness, fight without any fever of the mind.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhy do you bother? I will take care of them. I will put them in control. I will take care of how the reins should be. I will keep the driver in check. Don’t take the responsibility into your hands. This is what He said.\nFirst, indriyas (senses) - and then the manas (mind). What does manas (mind) do? Manas (mind) makes resolutions. Making resolutions is its work. Logic. Manas (mind) always uses logic to make statements and conclusions. It thinks of what’s right, what’s wrong. Buddhi (intellect) makes decisions. Manas (mind) makes resolutions. Indriyas (senses) work.\nIf indriyas (senses) want something, you end up giving. Kids tend to run behind whatever they see on the roadside. The wise mother or father gives them what is suitable for them. They will deny what’s bad for the kids by either consoling, or caressing, etc. We know this.\nWhen indriyas (senses) seek something, manas (mind) tends to use logic to conclude that they are fine to have. We might have heard examples from history. Despite knowing that it is not right, manas (mind) will think ‘Yes, this is fine. Let’s do it’. We think it was Benjamin Franklin who once decided to be a vegetarian. He decided he should not eat non-vegetarian food. He was traveling from Philadelphia to Florida on a ship. Back then, it would take a month or so. Considering the length of the journey, there was a need to eat during the journey. There was food arranged but whatever was suitable to him soon ran out. What can he do? They had to get food from the ocean! What do you get in the oceans? Sea food, like fish, etc. Everyone else was eating those. He decided not to eat them but how long can he starve? It had been 3 or 4 days. He was feeling hungry. What should he do? He thought, “I have to live. I need to eat to live. It’s inevitable that I will eat them.” Gradually, he brought his manas (mind) to arrive at a suitable logical conclusion, and he began to eat. This is what he wrote in his autobiography. He knew that it was not right for him. When the underlying ka:ma (desire) to eat, influenced him to act, he devised supportive logic. Meaning, he made his manas (mind) accept it. After that, the buddhi (intellect) joined in. Then, he proceeded to eat.\nEven before a burglary, a thief’s manas (mind) will use some logic to decide if it is necessary or not. “Yes. God gave me a family. Because it's my primary responsibility to take care of them…” “I have to take care of my family. So, I have to do something. Now, I am presented with burglary as an option. I must do it.” He makes a resolution with his manas (mind). Then, he makes the decision with buddhi (intellect). Then, buddhi (intellect) inspires manas (mind). Manas (mind) inspires indriyas (senses). Indriyas (senses) put him into action. There is activity in all these places. Therefore, it is indriyas (senses) that are primary tools for anything. They are the ones that act. But, buddhi (intellect) and manas (mind) help them. So, it is very important that you first regulate the indriyas (senses).\nthasma:th thvam indriya:ny a:dau niyamya (Therefore, you must first regulate the senses)\nIf you want to qualify jna:na (knowledge), you must first clean the indriyas (senses).\nWe are told, “You must fast on e:ka:dasi (a fasting day).” You did not have breakfast or lunch. By 3 or 4pm, you will feel starved. By evening, it will grow even more. If you can make it through the night as it’s already evening, then e:ka:dasi (fasting) is achieved. Otherwise, if he moans and complains… In fact, nothing will happen if he doesn’t eat. He won’t die. There is no loss if one fasts for a day. However, if he can cross the ‘painful’ state and remain in control, he will easily succeed. But indriyas (senses) don’t let him be that way. They will trouble him. Because there is a state that holds you during that difficult phase. We talked about this earlier. Just as Tena:li Ra:makrishna utilized the goat or cat appropriately, there must be some effort to control indriyas (senses) to some extent, restricting them from every desire. The same is described in chapter 2.\nvishaya:n indriyaischaran (the senses moving among sense objects)\nIf manas (mind) is logically looking for ways to conclude that they are suitable and worth eating, or doing, you must show it something better.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvishaya: vinivarthanthe: nira:ha:rasya\nde:hinaha rasavarjam\nraso:pyasya param drustva: nivarthathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSense objects turn away from an abstinent person,\nbut the taste for them remains. Even that taste departs\nwhen one experiences the Supreme.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhatever pain that he is feeling will come down only when you can show something better. Drawing a longer line makes the first line shorter naturally. The same goes for a third longer line compared to the 2nd. Only if you can show the unique Bhagavad thatthva (truth of the Lord) that is different from the worldly objects… Only when you can teach them to act for the Lord… Indriyas (senses) will come under control.\nWe all know - we don’t like to enjoy things without those that we like. Despite liking it or despite it being right next to you, or despite you being hungry… When your child is not next to you, you will have the sahanam (patience), to wait until he arrives. It is called thithiksha (tolerance). Similarly, change the pravrutthi (tendency) of thinking that all activities are by you and for you. “This is for Krishna’s. It is meant for Him. This is because of Him.” If we can instill this bha:vana (feeling/attitude), the intense speed of the indriyas (senses) will reduce. If you practice this and improve on it gradually, the manas (mind) will come into control. You must make a firm decision on it. Thus, you are responsible to give the same to buddhi (intellect). Whatever it is, it is the indriyas (senses) that put you into action.\nthasma:th thvam indriya:ny a:dau niyamya bharatharshabha! | (Therefore, O best of the Bharatas, first control your senses!)\npa:pma:nam prajahi (give up this sinful desire)\npa:pma:nam (sinful desire)\nthe ka:ma (desire) that makes us do all kinds of wrong things\nKa:ma (desire) causes one to perform pa:pa karmas (sinful acts) inspired by the attitude of ‘I’, ‘by me’, ‘for me’, ‘mine’.\nprajahi: hi (you must definitely win over them)\nWhat does it do?\njna:na vijna:na na:sanam (destroys knowledge and discernment)\nka:ma (desire) destroys jna:na (knowledge)\nWhat jna:na (knowledge) does it destroy? It destroys the jna:na (knowledge) that we are different from the body.\nvijna:na na:sanam (destroys discernment)\nThere is jna:na (knowledge) that is vivichya (which allows one to discern). Objects are not bad. Activities are not bad. The body is not bad. The ji:va (soul) is not bad. If you link them to ‘I’ instead of linking them to God, then they become bad [for you]. So, what we do should be inspired by Him, as a service to Him…\nbhagavatho: bale:na (by the Lord's strength), bhagavatho: vi:rye:na (by the Lord's power)\nbhagavathasthe:jasa: (by the Lord's radiance), bhagavathaskarmana: (by the Lord's action)\nbhagavad karma ka:rayishye: (I will perform actions for the Lord)\nWhen you are doing it for Him, they won’t bind you. Otherwise, they make you undertake pa:pa (sinful) acts.\nvijna:na na:sanam (destroys discernment)\nThat is ka:ma (desire). So, learn to control indriyas (senses) first. Start the journey from there.\nWhat is most important to regulate? It is essential to know this. Where should we start control? What is the most intense one? What is the most dangerous one? Most commentators on Gita have interpreted this incorrectly. Ramanujacharya Swami gives a wonderful explanation on verse 3.42.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nindriya:ni para:nya:huhu\nindriye:bhyah param manaha |\nmanasas thu para: buddhihi\nyo: buddhe:h parathasthu saha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe senses are superior to the body;\nthe mind is superior to the senses;\nthe intellect is superior to the mind;\nand that which is superior to the intellect is the Self.\n-----------------------------------------------\nindriya:ni para:ni (senses are very powerful)\nindriye:bhyah param manaha (mind is stronger than senses)\nmanasas thu para: buddhihi (intellect is even stronger than mind)\nyo: buddhe:h parathasthu saha (that is stronger than intellect)\nWhat is it that is stronger than buddhi (intellect)? Many of them said it is God and linked Him to it. It is ka:ma (desire) that is stronger than buddhi (intellect) and is harder to bring into control.\nsaha ka:maha (that is desire)\nSaying so, he moves ahead. Let’s learn.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

Some obediently obey instructions. However, some are very naughty and very adamant. If an instruction is passed, they do the opposite of it. They do the exact opposite of what’s being told.

What is it that is really hard to bring under control? We must know this first. We can then work on those which can be easily controlled and bring them to our side.

If you say that bitter gourd is good for health, you may eat it the first day, crying. The second day, you won’t go near it. If you say that sugar is not good for health, you will literally only want to eat sweet foods. You will only go in that direction. They are the ones that you want to eat. Despite knowing that it is not right for you, you will want to pick up that first from the prasa:dam (sacred offering) plate. Because indriyas (senses) got used to them, they become defaulted to them. It is difficult to get them to work on things they are not used to.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nindriya:ni para:nya:huhu\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe senses are very adamant.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAs discussed earlier, if required we must punish them and withdraw them gradually. It could take a year, two years, or five or ten years and the interest or attraction towards them might reduce. Even after reducing, they will try to run after them when they encounter those same temptations. With a very long term practice, they may be able to keep distance. If we separate vishayas (objects of experience) from indriyas (senses), there is a limited chance of coming into control.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nindriye:bhyah param manaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe mind is stronger and more adamant than the senses.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf we try to bring manas (mind) in control, it looks to be in control - but in reality, cheats us. We plan on performing japa (chanting) for sometime. We send away everyone and sit for meditation. Once we close our eyes, the manas (mind) starts to pace. It goes here and there, does that and this. It won’t say that it is going somewhere, doing something there, or returning. After settling back, then we realize manas (mind) has wandered to unnecessary places. Can’t it ask permission first? Can’t it notify us when returning? No, it won’t. We may not realize at other times but we experience this precisely when doing puja (worship), meditation, or reading some good book. When a person picks up a self improvement book, all of this comes into experience. Firstly, indriyas (senses) go against him. Eyes want to sleep. Mouth wants to eat something. Legs want to move. Hands want to do something else. Indriyas (senses) wander wherever they want to. Manas (mind) travels wherever it wants and we won’t know about it. Regulating manas (mind) is harder than regulating indriyas (senses) because it is stronger and more adamant.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nindriye:bhyah param manaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe mind is stronger and more adamant than the senses.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBecause that is the impact on manas (mind) from vishaya va:sanas (imprints of experiences with objects). After some practice, manas (mind) might listen. If indriyas (senses) start to listen after repeated instructions and pulling back… We might be able to gradually bring manas (mind) into control by chanting some sthothra (hymn) very diligently. We should do something such as a bhajan (devotional song), loud chanting of prayers, so the mind won’t be able to think of anything else.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nviswam vishnur vashatka:ro:\nbhu:tha bhavya bhavathprabhuhu\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe is the universe, Vishnu, the controller, the Lord of past, present, and future.\n-----------------------------------------------\nMaking someone chant or chant it ourselves. If we start this process, gradually after a certain time, manas (mind) will start to think favorably. It might let you read that book. Initially, it won’t even look at it or hear it or sit for it. After a certain period of practice, it might sit for some time. When one sits in jail, he won’t be allowed to do anything like using a cell phone or watching TV. What will he do? He won’t be allowed to go out of the four walls. How long will he sit like that? He will end up falling asleep. If he can’t sleep, he will think of something. After some time, one can bring the body into control. Similarly, in some time, one can try to bring manas (mind) into control. By giving manas (mind) that which is suitable… What is meant by ‘suitable’ things? Krishna told Arjuna to give [manas (mind)] those that are related to Him. If you train manas (mind) that way for a period of time, buddhi (intellect) might decide it on some day. “Those others are not suitable for us. Let’s stop them.” But, it’s very difficult. Because no matter how old one might be, if we tell that person that he is being made Prime Minister… He will be very excited. If someone has done all that he could in politics and thought he doesn’t want to do anything with it anymore… At 90 years old, if someone tells him that he is being made the Prime Minister… He will run like a 9 year old. We know of such examples. Initially, manas (mind) has some logic prepared to say that those things are not suitable. But, the underlying buddhi (intellect) is even stronger, the decisive faculty. Initially, one may decide that [retiring] is right for him. But, when someone comes and says he might be getting that seat, the earlier decision breaks. It starts to make efforts to get to it again. We are witnessing this in society. Meaning, buddhi (intellect) is so powerful. It is perhaps possible to control the indriyas (senses). It is perhaps possible to control the manas (mind). However, it is extremely difficult to control the buddhi (intellect). After working hard for some time, even if you get buddhi (intellect) into control, regulating desires is even more difficult.\nWe may have heard about Dhruthara:stra. He knows Pandavas are good people. He knows his sons are being bad. Yet, he did not pull his buddhi (intellect) away from his sons. He knew that Pandavas were good people. His manas (mind) was in his control. Indriyas (senses) were in his control. Yes, the buddhi (intellect) had decided that his own sons must get the kingdom. What can he do? The war almost ended. Duryodhana was the only one remaining. Bhima fought with him and killed him by breaking his thigh. It’s all over. Finally, his buddhi (intellect) came to the conclusion that his sons wouldn’t get the kingdom. The ka:ma (desire), and wish must be in control. Right? He should think, “Pandavas will now rule the kingdom. Let them happily do it.” But the desire in Dhruthara:stra was so strong that he called Bhima over to eliminate even him! Sri Krishna was next to them. That’s why he was saved. Otherwise, they [Pandavas] would have been consumed by the fire of desire. In fact, they would have been killed long ago.\nkrushna:sraya:ha (leading lives resorting to Sri Krishna only)\nkrushna bala:ha (our strength does not matter, we are useless, Sri Krishna is the real strength, the goal is to walk the path He shows)\nkrushna na:ttha:scha pa:ndava:ha (they felt Krishna is everything)\nThat is why, He gave them life. Even in the last minute, He protected Bhima and the rest from not falling prey to Dhruthara:stra by controlling him. Because they took refuge in Him, because they have surrendered to Him… He protected them. This is what Mahabharata enlightens us with. Ka:ma (desire) in us is also of that nature.\nHe explained it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nindriya:ni para:nya:huhu\nindriye:bhyah param manaha |\nmanasas thu para: buddhihi\nyo: buddhe:h parathasthu saha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe senses are superior to the body; the mind is superior to the senses; the intellect is superior to the mind; and the soul (or desire) is superior to the intellect.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKa:ma (desire) is very dangerous. It can mislead buddhi (intellect) too. It can change the decision achieved by buddhi (intellect). In Chapter 2, He explained that buddhi (intellect) is of two types. One is vyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi (resolute intellect). Second is avyavasa:thmika: buddhi (irresolute intellect). Vyavasaya:thimika: buddhi (resolute intellect) is when it is e:ka (fixed with a single focus). Pandavas have decided that Krishna is everything for them. Whatever He tells, that is what they do. There is no second independent thought about it. Finish! This is\nvyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhi hi e:ka (fixed intellect in one direction)\nbahusa:kha:hi anantha:scha: buddhayaha avyavasa:yina:m (there is no fixed direction for intellect, it goes in multiple directions)\nIf buddhi (intellect) is not firm on something, manas (mind) will always make resolutions in favor of indriyas (senses). It will drive buddhi (intellect) along with it. That will destroy the person. Therefore, dear one! Ka:ma (desire) is something that can mislead buddhi (intellect) also. What should we do about it? Swami is explaining the method for that in verse 3.43.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:vam buddhe:h param buddhva:\nsamsthabhy a::thma:nam a:thmana: |\njahi sathrum maha:ba:ho:!\nka:maru:pam dura:sadam ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThus, knowing that which is superior to the intellect, steadying the mind by the intellect, O mighty-armed one, conquer this enemy in the form of desire, which is difficult to overcome.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKa:ma (desire) is stronger than buddhi (intellect) and is very adamant. It will consume those interested with it. If one says he does not drink coffee, the person next to him will encourage him to try. It will give you relaxation. It will give good stimulation. You can drink it. It should not become an addiction - what’s wrong in it. That’s how one feels in the beginning. After some time, it makes one addicted that if he doesn’t have it at that time, he feels like the world is turning upside down. That’s how far desire takes him. Things around him also will add and grow the desires in him, like fuel to fire. Remember we talked about this earlier… Smoke, mirror, and placenta. He gave three examples. For some, desires arise from within. For some, they are influenced by external forces. For some, they are ever existing. Ka:ma (desire) is always encapsulating him. It is a very dangerous one. It is stronger than buddhi (intellect).\ne:vam buddhe:h param buddhva: (realize that it is stronger than intellect)\nsamsthabhy a:thma:nam (mind) a:thmana: (intellect) (control your mind with intellect)\nGod termed both of them as atma (self). We learned earlier that the word atma (self) is used to refer to many things.\na:thma (self) ji:ve: (in the living being) dhruthou (in courage) de:he (in the body) swabha:ve: (in one's nature) parama:thmani: (in the Supreme Self)\nThe word atma (self) can be used for all of these. Here, He is using atma (self) for two. One is that manas (mind) has the name of atma (self). The second one is that buddhi (intellect) also has the name of atma (self).\nsamsthabhy a:thma:nam (mind) a:thmana: (intellect) (control mind with intellect)\nWhen you control them, you can defeat nithya vairi (eternal enemy) known as ka:ma (desire).\njahi sathrum maha:ba:ho (mighty-armed one)! (win over the enemy called…)\nka:maru:pam dura:sadam (that ka:ma (desire) which is impossible to control in anyway)\njahi (win over it)\nHe called Arjuna as mahaba:ho (mighty-armed one)! Why? Because he has ahanka:ra (ego), a feeling that he is powerful and can achieve it all. “I pleased Paramasiva with my thapas (penance).” “I pleased Indra with my efforts.” He has such pride. “You think you have such strong shoulders - yet, your strength is not enough to control ka:ma (desire).” Your muscle power cannot stop it.\ndura:sadam (unsuppressible)\nIt is very strong. What should be used to suppress it? It should be suppressed with buddhi (intellect). It is buddhi (intellect) that should be used to suppress manas (mind) and ka:ma (desire). That is why one must work on enhancing buddhi (intellect). What He said about buddhi (intellect) in Chapter 2, vyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhi (resolute intellect), we must revisit and apply it here.\na:thma:nam (mind) a:thmana: (intellect) samsthabhya (control mind with intellect)\nIf you can qualify manas (mind) with buddhi (intellect), there is a chance that ka:ma (desire) can be controlled. This is the great upade:sa (teaching), which He is giving us. He started by advising us to do everything as yajna (sacrificial action), every activity as service to the Lord. That is at the beginning of Chapter 3. He said, He created everyone alongside yajnas (sacrificial actions). He said that yajna (sacrificial action) is the center of everything. He asked us to live life as yajna (sacrificial action). He said yajna (sacrificial action) is nothing but worshiping Him.\nyaja de:va pu:ja:ya:m yajnam (Yajna is a:ra:dhana (devotionally driven service and prayer) to the Lord.)\nYajna (sacrificial action) is a:ra:dhana (devotionally driven service and prayer) to the Lord. You must lead life as yajna (sacrificial action). The activities of indriyas (senses) are for yajna (sacrificial action). The resolutions in mind should be for yajna (sacrificial action). The firm determination of buddhi (intellect) is to lead your life in the process of yajna (sacrificial action). If you do all of that, then…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nde:va:n bha:vayatha: the: de:va: bha:vayanthuvaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBy this, you nourish the gods, and may the gods nourish you.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou can worship Nature and Nature will cooperate with you. Since I am also with you, if you submit everything you do to Me through Nature, I will receive it. I will bestow the necessary help for you. Whatever work you are doing, do not take the burden yourself. “This is all me. It is happening because of me. This is all mine.” It is your responsibility to change that bha:vana (feeling). He stated this clearly. He started Chapter 3 with this. As He reached the end of the chapter, He said…\nka:ma ru:pam dura:sadam jahi (you must win over ka:ma (desire) which is difficult to overcome)\nEven though you don’t wish for it, it [ka:ma (desire)] is that which is inspiring you. I am telling you to submit all that you do to Me. Yet, it is ka:ma (desire) that is not letting you submit them to Me. So, what you must take control of is ka:ma (desire). It is your primary enemy. It is not something you can try and satiate with various things. It is not something that you can suppress even though you try. So, you must take control of it.\nmaha:ba:ho (mighty-armed one)!\nTo win over it, focus on Me. Submit your bha:va (feeling) on Me. That is when it transforms into yajna (sacrificial action). All activities that you do as yajna (sacrificial action) will become divine worship. Whatever you attain because of that will be amrutha (nectar of immortality).\nyajna sista amrutha bhujaha (one who experiences the nectar of immortality as a result of performing yajna (sacrificial action))\nya:nthi bramha sana:thanam (he will realize atma (soul) or God, then nothing will bind him)\nSaying so, He does the swaru:pa niru:pana (establishes the true nature) of karma (action) that is practiced. He establishes who the activities should be performed for and how. Sri Krishna thus ends Chapter 3 of Bhagavad Gita. It is called karma yoga (path of action). It is a scripture of 43 verses. Now that is concluded, let’s progress toward Chapter 4.\nJai Srimannarayana!"
