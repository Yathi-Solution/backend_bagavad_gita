    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We have been navigating the ocean of Bhagavad Gita. So far, we have completed chapter 1. We are entering chapter 2. Bhagavad Gita is a jnana amrutha-dhara (flow of knowledge nectar), an extremely pure and sacred river that sanctifies the one taking a dip in it.\nIf bathing in the waters of Bhagavad Gita, i.e., becoming a recipient of its knowledge... Elders say, “samsara mala mochanam” (cleansing of the cycle of birth and death). Samsara (the cycle of life) refers to the ego that is inculcated! The knowledge waters of Bhagavad Gita are the only waters that can cleanse that dirt - the ego! If we bathe in ordinary water, only the dirt on our physical body will be cleansed, to some extent. To cleanse the dirt accumulated and embedded in our inner layers, we must attain the knowledge given in Gita. Gita removes our defects absorbed in each internal layer, in a systematic and orderly fashion.\nOne of the common blemishes we see in humans is cowardice and sorrow. It is very important to be free from sorrow. Even someone like Hanuman, upon entering Lanka and not being able to locate Mother Sita, felt deeply disappointed. He was engulfed with sadness. However, as he was an intelligent being – buddhimatha:m varishttha (the most intelligent), he introspected. He realized that it is highly unwise and dangerous to succumb to grief. It is the cause for all tragedies.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nso:ko: na:sayathe: dhai:ryam so:ko: na:sayathe: srutham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nGrief annihilates our strength.\n-----------------------------------------------\nNo matter what advice, how it’s given, or the number of attempts, it all falls wayward when we are immersed in sorrow.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nso:kaha na:sayathe: sarvam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nGrief makes us useless.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna:sthi so:ka samo: ripuhu\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“There is no worse enemy than sorrow”, says Hanuman.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSorrow is like a dangerous enemy. If this dirt enters or engulfs us, it is equivalent to opening the gateway of doom. The knowledge of Bhagavad Gita cleanses us of this dirt, also termed as sorrow, in a systematic way and purifies our heart. In Bhagavad Gita chapter 1, Arjuna experienced grief. Not simply ordinary grief, but inappropriate grief. Yamunacharya Swamy describes Arjuna’s grief at that moment.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nastha:na sne:ha ka:runya dharma:dharma dhiya: a:kulam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nArjuna felt belongingness (sneha) at an undeserving (astha:na) place - it led to compassion...\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe lost his sense of dharma (righteous practice) and adharma (unrighteous practice) and became indecisive about what needed to be done as well as what needed to be abstained from. The advice that Lord gave Arjuna in this precarious situation is named Bhagavad Gita. That was how Bhagavad Gita was born, sa:sthra avatharana (the descent of scripture), says Yamunacharya Swami.\nIn fact, we can be called human beings only when appropriate emotions surface at appropriate times. Example: If power is to be shown, let it be. If pity has to be felt, let it be. If pride should be expressed, let it be. One must feel proper emotions at fitting times and places. If inappropriate emotions are experienced at inappropriate situations, it can be fatal. For example, feeling a sense of bonding where there should be detachment can lead to downfall.\nWe have probably heard a few historic episodes. There was a great man by the name of Jada Bharatha. We must have heard his name. He had an amazing power in his past life. He was the famous one, due to whom this entire world came to be known as Bharatha. His descendants are the well-known Bharatha vamsa (dynasty). There is a misconception that this land is called Bharatha after the son of Sakuntala, who also had the same name. However, that is untrue. Ages before that, a great king named Bharatha used to rule the land. All the dwellers on every continent of this world had a great sense of pride, belonging to him.\nIn those days, after reaching old age, one would delegate any household responsibilities to others in order to adopt a life of austerity and meditation in the forest. Bharatha, too, left for the forest to meditate. He had only three to four months left to live. One day when bathing at a river, he noticed a frightened, pregnant doe jumping over the water. It gave birth to a fawn and died. Bharatha saw the newborn deer and took pity. He should have just brought it out of the water to safety and left it there. Instead, he took it along with him to his hut. He started feeding it milk and made regular efforts to fetch the milk to feed it. From there, he got entangled with the activities of the baby deer. He began activities to procure its food and to feed it.\nWhen it was approximately 1.5 months old, it began to wander. From then on, he experienced fear that it might be attacked by wild animals. Even whilst meditating, his thoughts ran towards the baby deer and kept worrying about its safety. His japa (meditative activity) gradually declined and he began focusing completely on the deer. At the time of his death, he had no other thoughts. He was consumed with worry for the deer and anxiety over its safety after his departure. He departed from this world with his consciousness solely focused on that deer. As a result, he was reborn as a deer. However, since he had accumulated positive merits from his earlier birth, he gave up his life as a deer and was again born as a man along with his earlier good merits. He spent his new life without attachment, seeking knowledge, and without any interest in worldly matters. So, he was called ‘Jada’ – the indifferent one or non-responsive [to worldly matters]. He was named Bharatha again. As he was indifferent to worldly matters, he came to be known as “Jada Bharatha”. He was extremely knowledgeable.\nLater, Veda Vyasa tells us how Jada Bharatha enlightens a king in spirituality. During the past birth, he had developed a bond with the deer at an inappropriate time. After that, he began to have compassion towards it. Thus, he too suffered from the blemish of astha:na sneha ka:runya. So he had also become dharma adharma dhiya: a:kulam, unable to distinguish between dharma and adharma. What was his dharma? He had come to the forest to lead the life of an ascetic and to shed his mortal coil at the divine feet of the Lord whilst in penance.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyoge:na anthe: thanu thyaja:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe had been living like that all along, but unfortunately, towards the end, he wavered.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe forgot his dharma and wrongly undertook responsibility that was not meant for him. People may ask – isn’t it correct to empathize and show compassion towards all beings? That is true, but, within boundaries. It should not exceed those limits. It is foolish to think that one is solely responsible for everyone and everything in the world. He should participate in the welfare of those around him, within his capacity. The rest should be taken care of by themselves.\nWe sometimes see wild animals bringing up the baby of a human or another animal. It is not necessary to think that all such abandoned creatures could get killed and therefore should be sheltered and brought up by us. Nature or God make appropriate arrangements for everything. He [Jada Bharatha] should have had that faith. However, by taking the responsibility of that deer upon himself, instead of achieving liberation from the cycle of birth-and-death after human life, he had to unfortunately be born as an animal. History teaches us this.\nSo, we should remember that compassion is good, but it can be destructive when it arises during inappropriate situations (astha:na). In Bhagavad Gita chapter 1, Arjuna too felt an untimely and unwanted sorrow after having prepared fully well for the war. That’s because he felt pity when he shouldn’t have. He felt empathy in the wrong place. In reality, there is no need to pity the enemy. When the enemy is unleashing violence, it becomes a warrior's responsibility to subdue that violence. Arjuna lost that wisdom and was overtaken by grief. He threw down his weapons. Directly in front of God, who had descended to uphold dharma, he sacrificed his weapons and sat down in the middle of his chariot – ratho:pastha upa:visath (sat down on the chariot).\nHe refused to wage war, which was his dharma. He filled his heart with compassion for the undeserving. That is how Bhagavad Gita chapter 1 concluded. The same sorrow continues in the second chapter as well. However, there is a subtle difference between the sorrow in chapter 1 vs chapter 2. What is that difference? Can there be differences in sorrow too? Yes, sorrow can be of various kinds. We will see those details as we continue. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Sorrow is a kind of disease that entraps and torments a person. It occurs due to many reasons and can be of different kinds too. Human beings at times experience sorrow caused by feelings of jealousy, envy, hatred, love, or compassion. There can be different levels in the state of sorrow as well – basic level, aggravated level, completely crippling state, and so on.\nIn Bhagavad Gita, God has given a wonderful message aimed primarily at addressing this sorrow. If sorrow arises out of selfishness, it is detrimental. However, if it arises out of compassion for others, it is said to be beneficial. If sorrow arises in one to benefit or help another, it is good, despite the suffering it may cause for the one trying to help. What is very important is whether the empathy for the other person is for a worthy cause or not. \nIf you come across a drunkard on the street lamenting for money and you donate some for buying alcohol, even though the action is a result of compassion, we do not consider it to be healthy compassion. It is important to have the underlying compassion and the sorrow for wanting to reform a person. \nWhat does compassion actually mean? In the first chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna was moved with compassion. It progressively increased. The second chapter begins with it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nసంజయ ఉవాచ - \nతం తథా కృపయాఽవిష్టమ్,  అశ్రుపూర్ణాకులేక్షణమ్  ।\nవిషీదన్తమిదం వాక్యమ్,  ఉవాచ మధుసూదనః ॥\nsanjaya uva:cha  -\ntham thattha: krupaya::vishtam, \nasru pu:rna:kule:kshanam ।   \nvishi:dantham idam va:kyam,\nuva:cha madhusu:danaha  ॥\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSanjaya said: \nSeeing Arjuna overwhelmed with compassion and his eyes brimming with tears, Madhusudana (Krishna) spoke these words.\n-----------------------------------------------\nCompassion has fully enveloped Arjuna. What caliber of Arjuna? Arjuna, who during the first chapter, in the presence of Sri Krishna, the One who descended to protect dharma, followed his dharma, organized the stage [for the war] himself, gathered everyone at the battlefield, sounded his conch too [signaling strong will and readiness], and was all set to unleash his weapons. At this moment, Arjuna was overcome with compassion. This should not have happened at all.\nOn the operation table, having laid the patient down, having given all the medication necessary, having cut the body open to begin the surgery essential for his health, if the doctor feels compassion and gives up the act, letting go of his ‘weapon’, knife and other instruments off his hand, what do we call such a surgeon? The surgeon would be arrested and put in prison [for risking the patient’s life]. He is not allowed to do that. After preparing the patient for surgery and making all the arrangements, it is imperative that the surgeon remove the defective part, complete the surgery, and do whatever is necessary to restore the patient’s health. After completing that, he can retrospect and feel compassionate but not before that. Whatever is necessary to be done, must be done - mandatorily.\nAt this point, Arjuna is in the position of that surgeon. The people lined up in front of him had committed different crimes. If an eligible and capable person leaves the guilty free, he will be considered more guilty than the ones who were originally declared guilty. Arjuna right now is in such a state. The ones in the opposing party that day are all those who were unjust and cruel to him. They were Duryo:dhana, Dussa:sana, Karna, and others, and also those like Bhi:shma and Dro:na who took their side, although with pain. All these people, who had wronged Pandavas, knowingly came prepared for war. Now Arjuna is in the middle of this battlefield. However, is compassion well placed here?\nRight now, Arjuna is possessed by compassion. Sometimes we see some people are ‘possessed’ by de:vathas (gods) and sometimes by demons. People say so, we can’t see either the de:vathas or demons. The behavior of the ‘possessed’, for example, the way they speak, indicates whether they are possessed by a de:vatha or a demon. In any case, the person does not behave in his natural manner. He loses his own nature and exhibits the mannerisms of the other entity which has taken him over. Similarly, Arjuna is now possessed with ‘compassion’. His true self has disappeared. He has forgotten himself. He is under the influence of the compassion that has possessed him.\nWhat is his condition now? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nఅశ్రుపూర్ణాకులేక్షణమ్\nasru pu:rna a:kule:kshanam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHis eyes are distraught and filled with tears.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe can determine from his appearance that he is a dhi:ro:da:ththa na:yakudu (noble hero). Such a noble hero should not wail helplessly. There is a rule in our texts that a hero should not wail helplessly. Does that mean that there are rules for the emotions flowing from within? Well, a hero should not wail helplessly, but should be more restrained. He may feel sorrow, but to what extent? To the extent that his eyes fill with tears, but the tears do not flow down! Right now, he is in that situation. \nHis eyes are welled up, and he is therefore indeed a noble hero. He is in a state of commotion, very disturbed. He has vision, but is not able to see. Why so? Because of the tears welled up in his eyes, he is not able to see that which he should see. He is not able to understand what he should understand. That is because sadly his manas (mind) is hurt and clouded. \nIn the sloka, they speak of his eyes as a representative of all senses (indriyas). However, it is not only his eyes, but even other senses are not functioning at their best. As a result of the overwhelming compassion, his other senses are also partially clouded. He is listening to what he should through his ears, but is not following it in the way it should be. That is the effect of compassion. Senses, body, and mind were all weakened. There are three karana:s (instruments) for a human being, right? All three failed for him [Arjuna] at this point. Why? Because of the effect of the wave of emotions. He is speaking that which he ought not to and not which he ought to. He is unable to differentiate between what he should do and what he should refrain from.\nIn fact, what is krupa (compassion)? Scriptures give three kinds of definitions for this. When scriptures say something, it is based on the states experienced [by people] in this world. So, what are those? \n- para duhkha asahishnutha (unable to bear the pain or sorrow of others)\n- para duhkha nira:chiki:rsha (not stopping at the intolerable pain of seeing others’ sorrow, he desires to take away the pain)\nHowever, does everyone really work towards this desire? Just because one is not able to tolerate something, does one work on relieving it? Many times, we too encounter disturbing events and feel agonized that it should not happen like that. However, do we respond to it? We strongly wish to eliminate it. Do we respond? No! One may not necessarily need to respond to someone’s pain although it is intolerable to see it. One may not get a chance to alleviate someone’s pain, even when desirous of doing so. That could be for various reasons, like one’s inability or magnitude of pain.\nOur elders tell us there is a third quality to define krupa, compassion. \n- para duhkha duhkhithvam (a state of experiencing another’s pain as his own). He should feel that the pain is caused to himself. And so, he immediately feels that he does not want the pain. He spontaneously reacts to eliminate the pain; cannot keep quiet in that case. Thus, although para duhkha asahishnutha or para duhkha nira:chiki:rsha refer to krupa, our people define krupa to be para duhkha duhkhithvam.\nLord Rama had that quality in Him. If ever He saw anyone crying or suffering, He would experience the same agony as the other person. When one cries for another as if he is experiencing the pain himself, then spontaneously he will not want it. He will necessarily strive to eliminate it. To get rid of his own pain, he needs to address the pain of the other person. Hence, he will act on doing so. Subsequently, he will succeed in it. That is called krupa, compassion.\nArjuna is feeling this compassion now. We are discussing for whom this compassion should be felt. He had felt compassion in the first chapter, and up to some extent in the second chapter as well. In the first chapter, Arjuna felt compassion towards the entire army in general, that soldiers may get hurt. He wanted to remove the pain that would be caused to all of them. That was in chapter one. But later, in the second chapter, that compassion got gradually focused towards two individuals primarily. Who are the two? One person is his grandfather Bhi:shma. The other is guru Dro:nacha:rya, who taught him to use weapons and brought him up. Now his compassion is centered on them. \nSo the compassion and the resulting sorrow that Arjuna feels in the second chapter is primarily for the two great people - Bhi:shma and Dro:na. How did he feel this compassion? And what did it do to Arjuna? How was that answered? We will get to know in the second chapter, as we go along. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), The great knowledgeable people… rushis (sages), seers… all the various incarnations of God… and the acharyas (teachers) who enlighten us about thatthvam (true nature of existence)… they all have one goal. We must become faultless, live happily and peacefully, so that we can eventually attain life’s goal.\nWe are all called ‘samsarulu’ (those caught in the cycle of birth and death). ‘Samsara’ means to believe that our external body (deha) and the soul (atma) residing in it - which we refer to as ‘I’ - are one and the same. This is called ‘deha-atma-viveka-rahityam’ (inability to differentiate between body and soul). Our elders termed it ‘samsara’. ‘Sam’ means two different objects, ‘sar’ means to believe that they are one. Both are different entities. The body is a different entity. The soul (atma), residing in it, is different.\nAs long as the atma resides in the body, the body is able to do different activities. It is also capable of various thoughts. However, if the atma exits the body, it is simply a wooden log – a conscious-less object. Then the body is not aware of whether it’s burned, frozen, or affected in any other way. However, if these are felt, it means that there is something else [other than the body] that is pervading it. That entity is capable of ‘knowing’ things. It resides somewhere inside the body and is infusing energy throughout the body. It is also ‘knowing’ different occurrences.\nAs it pervades throughout the body, it is named ‘atma’. As it gives life to the body, it is also named ‘jiva’ (living entity). Since it is the reason for consciousness in the body, it is called ‘chit’ (consciousness). It has a few other names too. This atma is there inside the body somewhere. We do not know its size. We cannot say with certainty where it resides within the body. But with the power of knowledge it has, atma pervades the whole body, in every atom of it.\nEven after the atma leaves the body, it exists elsewhere. It roams somewhere, does something. Whilst in the body, it works within the boundaries of the body. The body is a vehicle for it. The soul entered the body to utilize it as a tool. Man needs to know that both atma and the body are different entities. He needs to work while not obstructing its goal and not misusing the body. Thus, knowledge is very important to man.\nWhat knowledge? Knowledge is not defined as the know-how of identifying material objects like tables, chairs, etc. Parashara Maharshi (sage) says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nतद् ज्ञानम्, अज्ञानमतोऽन्यदुक्तम्\ntad jnana, ajnana mato'nyaduktam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nReal knowledge is that which enables us to understand that there are three distinct entities – I (atma), this body (deha), and the thatthvam (true nature) that drives them - are existing currently as one unit.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is real knowledge – ‘tad jnana’. Knowledge other than this, of any kind, in any magnitude, is ‘ajnana uktham’ (nescience). Such pseudo-knowledge need not be termed as ‘jnana’ (knowledge) - even animals have it! Even insects have such instincts. They too know such things, but we don't refer to them as knowledgeable. In fact, they have greater knowledge [of certain aspects] than us.\nIf we observe a mosquito, it tends to hide on our body, where our hand cannot reach. It bites us there and knows how to escape. Observe any species other than humans, you will realize they have great intelligence. However, their knowledge is limited to protecting their body, procuring their food, and scaring away whatever danger they encounter. It does not extend to what is within the body. Most animals do not even have the awareness to think about the future. Even they have the ability to do so only temporarily, like sparrows.\nAt the proper breeding time, they plan to build a nest for little ones. The sparrow designs and constructs a beautiful nest, although it may not have any means or any tools to do so. On the other hand, man has limbs and various tools that he can put to use. Whereas the sparrow only has a beak, with which it gathers sticks, leaves, and fibers. It spots a place on a tree out of reach of other animals and builds the nest there to hatch eggs and give birth to chicks. Once the chicks grow older, they no longer need that nest. It abandons the nest and goes its way. It does not reuse the nest when it needs to breed next time. It builds another one from scratch.\nThus, its ability to look into the future is limited and temporary. It cannot think about the purpose of its existence here. If indeed any animal had this ability to think about it, the very existence of man would be at risk. The animals would all rebel against man. Man alone has such awareness. So, he should not limit it to the present body or only the current lifetime. Instead, he should think of ways not to return to this vicious circle of birth and death.\nOur rushis (sages) instruct us to acquire such knowledge. That is the real knowledge. All other knowledge makes us think in lines of body and atma being the same - and our actions are in accordance with that ignorance. Such ignorance is termed ‘samsara’. We are all obsessed with our external body and its safety, its nourishment, its comfort, and its maintenance. The body is not permanent. One day, it is vibrant, but eventually, it wrinkles and disintegrates.\nIf the body succumbs to mechanical problems, it stops functioning properly. Since man has made himself dependent on this body, any changes or degeneration in it makes him anxious and sorrowful. Sorrow is good in a way. But what should be the reason for sorrow? Man should be sorrowful when he reflects upon the questions such as… What should I do? What should I achieve? Where am I? Where should I have been? …and realizes that he has only something so mundane when in fact he deserves a lot more! That should be the reason for his sorrow.\nHowever, since he is oblivious of his goal, he is absorbed in only worrying about the body, which is temporary. Thus, God had to begin delivering the message of Gita so that humans could have a means to emerge from sorrow. This sorrow must arise because of the ignorance within. This is not sorrow which arises because of loss to or pain in the body. Because this sorrow is due to lack of knowledge, it should be corrected only with right knowledge. Knowledge should be attained by upadesam (instruction) from Elders. Therefore, it must be given through upadesam.\nArjuna was inflicted with sorrow that day. He felt what he was about to do was wrong as he saw relatives [on the battlefield]. The very nature of killing is sinful. Moreover, killing a relative is even more sinful; killing a relative in war is even more so. So, he thought he should refrain from war. When does a war become unjust? When the war is waged simply for the sake of it, without valid reason, then it is wrong. When a country is under attack from another nation causing internal commotion, we retaliate to teach a lesson - this is not an evil act.\nIn that event, if extremists who are taking the lives of people are killed in order to contain them, then it is not wrongful. Only when a war is waged without an appropriate reason, then it is wrong. Here, the other side [Kauravas] caused so much grief to [Pandavas], grabbed the kingdom, humiliated their wife in assembly, and did all kinds of misdeeds. So, the war waged against them can be described as dharma-yuddham (the rightful war). However, Arjuna has lost his ability to differentiate between dharma and adharma (righteousness and unrighteousness).\nIt is easy to explain to someone who either knows fully or does not know at all. Neither is he completely knowledgeable, nor completely ignorant. Partial knowledge is always dangerous.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nअज्ञः सुखमाराध्यः सुखतरमाराध्यते विशेषज्ञः\najnaha sukham-a:ra:dhyaha sukhatharam-a:ra:dhyathe: vise:shajnaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWe can easily explain anything to a person who is completely ignorant. We can educate him and bring him to the right path. In the case of a knowledgeable person, he will understand with a simple explanation.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHowever, as the saying goes…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nज्ञानलवदुर्विदग्धं ब्रह्माऽपि नरं न रञ्जयति\njna:na-lava-durvidagdham naram na ranjayathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is impossible to convince someone who thinks he knows everything.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe can awaken someone who is fully asleep or talk to someone who is already awake. However, if someone is just pretending to be asleep, it is impossible to wake him up. Is Arjuna fully ignorant? The soldiers on the battlefield can be called ‘ajnas’ (ignorant ones). They are ready to obey the instructions given. ‘Ajnaha sukham-a:ra:dhyaha’, it is easy to instruct such soldiers and shape them accordingly. Dharmaraja (Yudhishthira) is an intelligent one, ‘vise:shajnaha’. We see that he did not have any doubts. Once he set his mind on war, he did not flinch. Hence he is known as ‘Yudhishtira’.\nEarlier, during the days of exile (aranya-vasa) when a celestial being (gandharva) abducted Duryodhana, he sent Bhima to subdue that gandharva and free Duryodhana. He did this because it was a time to show pity [towards Duryodhana]. However, when both the parties have finalized to wage war and are ready to fight, there is no question of stepping back. Nor is there a chance for any mental doubts. That is why he is named ‘Yudhishtira’. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nयुधि तिष्ठति\nyudhi thishttathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe was steadfast in war.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHowever, Arjuna can neither be categorized as ‘ajna’ (ignorant) nor ‘vise:shajna’ (knowledgeable). He is in between. That is why he started having doubts. Thus, God had to address these doubts. It is indeed very difficult to satisfy such people. To achieve that, He had to give a 17-chapter discourse. Dharmaraja did not need any of these instructions. The rest of the army did not need any such teaching. He [Sri Krishna] had to bestow this knowledge to Arjuna. All of us are in the same state as Arjuna as well. We should all get rid of our sorrows. We should learn what is meant to be learned. We have to be molded in such a way to be ready to discharge our rightful duties. That is the goal of Bhagavad Gita. Let us get to know how it is achieved as we move forward.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita begins chapter 2 with a moral from Sanjaya. Sanjaya apprises Dhrutharashtra, describing Arjuna’s state of mind.\nSanjaya Uva:cha (Sanjaya said):\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntham thattha: krupaya:vishtam asru pu:rna:kule:kshanam|\nvishi:dantham idam va:kyam uva:cha madhusu:danaha||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe, who was overwhelmed with compassion and whose eyes were filled with tears, spoke this sorrowful statement.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna is possessed with the feeling of mercy, like someone overtaken by an external power. He lost [control of] himself. He speaks as if he were under its influence. In fact, he didn’t know much, but he spoke as if he knew everything. This is dangerous. If one who knows about dharma (righteousness) and adharma (unrighteousness) speaks about them, then it is beneficial. However, if one who doesn’t know speaks as if he knows, then it is harmful. These days you find many such people. You are all nice folks. Like us, there are speakers who don’t know anything despite acting so knowledgeable. We speak as if we know it all and do not like to admit our ignorance. Arjuna is now in a similar state. He is consumed by sorrow. He is unable to differentiate good from bad. He is unable to decide whether to wage the war or not. He is disinclined to wage war. He would like to withdraw from the war but he knows that’s not right. They (Pandavas) came prepared for the war. He is well aware of his own capabilities.\nUnder normal circumstances, an individual’s sorrow can be pacified accordingly. However, an agitated person cannot be appeased with a normal conversation. He also acts in a way that is unnatural to him. He behaves according to that which is consuming him. Poor Arjuna was behaving thus. Though Arjuna did not want to wage the war and threw down his weapons while collapsing in his chariot, he is not incompetent. He knows that he is fully capable. Because, earlier, during the war of Uththara Go:grahanam, the same Arjuna successfully waged the war. He fought these same Kauravas and all these elders then. Dro:na, Bhi:shma, Duryo:dhana, Ashwattha:ma, and Sakuni were all there then. He fought alone against all these men on that day. During exile, he attained pa:supata:sthra (a powerful weapon) by penance exclusively in preparation for the war. He sought this weapon knowing he will need it later. So it is incorrect to say that he is averse to the war. Also, it cannot be concluded that he is incapable. Earlier (during Uththara Go:grahanam war), this same “elder” [Arjuna] gave advice many times to Prince Uttara Kuma:ra. The abundant advices that Sri Krishna is giving to Arjuna now…this same Arjuna was giving it to the Uttara Kuma:ra then. Does he not know about it? Yes, he knows. But it’s the effect of anxiety.\nSri Krishna said to Arjuna – “Hey! Today you speak this way. With what authority are you speaking thus? You say you will not fight the war, and questioning why even wage war at all.” [Sri Krishna] – “Having arrived in the battlefield, you now say, as an inept person, that you will not fight. Your assumed role of Bruhannala (a disguise) was over. Today you should neither act nor speak that way.” Arjuna sank to the depths of sorrow as he lost the ability to differentiate right from wrong. He is in a deep state of visha:dam (despair). \n… visi:dantham …\nVisa:dam results when the mind gradually degrades and is lost. Imagine a mud ball. When it dries, it develops cracks. Later, when water is spilled over it, the mud ball softens, gradually flows out and merges into a plain land. If the mind goes through a similar experience then it is termed as visha:dam. It then loses its original identity, melts, wanders around and settles on something entirely different. Arjuna is in that state today and therefore, Sri Krishna advised him. To relieve him of sorrow, Sri Krishna delivered seventeen chapters of guidance! We alluded earlier that sadness felt under normal circumstances can be dealt with. However, sorrow due to aggravation cannot be addressed easily. That … a:bha:sa sukham (false happiness) … i.e when one does not realize real sukham (happiness) and dukham (sorrow) … then it is challenging to reveal the meaning of real sukham. Arjuna is dwelling in that state now. Actually, he needed to be told to crush his enemies and enjoy the victory, and the kingdom. \nbhunksho bho:ga:n samruddha:n (Enjoy the abundant pleasures)\nThis is what he [Arjuna] needs to do - this is actual sukham. Yet, he is contemplating to quit war, give up the kingdom, live in a forest and beg alms! He thinks of this as sukham. No! To realize happiness one has to endure sorrow. Since Arjuna was not experiencing this himself, Sri Krishna manifested an environment where the sorrow would dawn on him. In chapter 1, we learned that one of Bhagavan’s names is Hrushi:ke:sa (the one who controls the senses). He therefore controlled Arjuna’s senses and made him feel sorrow.\nsukham hi dukkha:ni anubhu:ya so:bhathe: (One who experiences sorrow appreciates happiness)\nUnless one experiences sorrow, he won’t realize the value of happiness. The value of light is appreciated only when one is in dark! A taste of spice will make one appreciate the sweetness of a dessert. Similarly, only the one who endured sorrow will appreciate the taste of happiness. Therefore, to make Arjuna truly realize what happiness is, Sri Krishna is actually making him feel the pain of sorrow. The sorrow of Arjuna is imbued with thrikarana suddhi (purity of thoughts, words, and actions). Meaning that he felt the sorrow via thrikarana suddhi. \nthrikarana suddhi is segregated as mano va:ka:yamulu (mind, speech, and body) …\n… i.e. he felt sorrow in his mind, in body and in senses. Sanjay explained this with words:\nasru pu:rna:kule:kshanam |\nvishi:dantham…\nWe mentioned earlier that sadness felt under normal circumstances can be dealt with, but sorrow with anguish is hard to manage. Such sorrow can be overcome only via thaththva jna:nam (knowledge about absolute truth). Further, such people [in visha:da] can decipher thaththva jna:nam only to a limited extent. Others [those not under distress] are able to grasp it all and choose the right path. However, for these people, they are only able to grasp enough to fulfill their current need. How far did Sri Krishna’s instruction benefit Arjuna? It only helped him enough to wage war. In reality, he did not gain the thaththva jna:nam despite listening to the entire Bhagavad Gita. He waged the war and later forgot all about it. \nUsing Arjuna as an excuse, knowing that we would be in a similar state where we think we know it all … when we really don’t, taking life to a distressed state not knowing what sukham and dukham are… Sri Krishna shared this to show the path. To pull ourselves out of sorrow, what does anyone do? We tend to search everywhere. Does it alleviate our sorrow when we make money? Or when we erect large buildings? Or when we own cars? Or when we have a large following? We try in innumerable ways. However, nothing will relieve our sorrow. On the contrary, these efforts worsen our sorrow. Because whatever we obtain needs to be maintained which further requires more earning and more effort. Therefore, whatever we do in this world with hopes of making us happy adds to increasing grief. Man attains eternal happiness only through thaththva jna:na. Bhagavan’s aim is to imbue this thaththva jna:na in all. This is the goal of Bhagavad Gita. Not just for Arjuna, but for all. For that reason, He began instructing this Bhagavad Gita. It began with sorrow. He started with Arjuna, who was consumed by sorrow. He concludes at 18.66…\nma: suchaha.\naham thva: sarva pa:pe:bhyo: mo:kshayishya:mi ma: suchaha || [18.66]\nSri Krishna states – “It’s not right to be depressed. Let go of that sorrow.” This is His final instruction. The verses that follow are treated as Uththara Pi:ttika (epilogue), meant to wrap up His guidance. But His intended message ends with 18.66. Bhagavad Gita started with the intent of getting over sorrow… and goes on until He states, “let go of sorrow.” \nAfter 10 chapters, Arjuna thought he had learned it all! At the end of the 10th chapter, instead of recovering from sorrow, Arjuna was faced with new doubts. “You claim many things. You say that You govern this universe. That the world is operating because of You. And that every aspect of every being is regulated by You. Is that true?” Arjuna thus wondered again. Despite listening intently, he heard it all with a sense of doubt. “If You truly are that powerful, then will You show it to me? I would like to visualize it.” It implies that Arjuna’s faith was still wavering. In chapter 11, Sri Krishna had to then reveal his Vira:tru:pam (divine universal form). After seeing that form, Arjuna believed Him. Sri Krishna, wondering whether Arjuna really understood everything, summarized the entire message again to further clarify. \nTherefore, Bhagavad Gita was not intended just for Arjuna. It was to melt the sorrows away from all of us. The manner it reached was… Arjuna initially felt mercy for all his relatives, feeling sad that they would all be killed. “I would also go to hell…” \n… luptha pindo:daka kriya:ha\npathanthi pitharaha  || [Sloka 1.42]\nHe was worried that they would all die and other unjust things would happen in a righteous war. His concern then gradually moved from all his relatives and fixated on two of them. Who are they? One is Dro:na and the other is Bhi:shma:cha:rya. It stopped with these two. Sanjaya was thus explaining this to Dhrutharashtra in the beginning of Chapter 2.\ntham thattha: krupaya:vishtam asru pu:rna:kule:kshanam|vishi:dantham idam va:kyam\nuva:cha madhusu:danaha||\nHere, Bhagavan is addressed as Madhusu:dana (the one who can remove faults). Bhagavan’s work is to eliminate faults, wherever they may exist. He doesn’t have to offer anything new; instead, he simply needs to remove these sins… similar to unblocking a stream whose flow into an agricultural field is ebbed by a levee. We also have blockages that prevent the free flow of knowledge in. He needs to clear those up for us. \nmadhusu:dana (the one who can remove such blockages)\nArjuna is facing such an impediment now. To help him overcome this, Sri Krishna began this conversation with him. He was questioning Arjuna. “Due to the sorrow you are experiencing, you’ll be accruing three sins.” What are they? How are they manifested? Let’s try to learn these as we move forward in this 2nd chapter. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We are discussing Bhagavad Gi:tha, Chapter 2. After Bhi:shma’s demise, Sanjaya explains the situation at the beginning of the war to Dhruthara:shtra. That is, on the 11th day of war, Sanjaya recounts the happenings of the first day of war. He is detailing Arjuna’s despaired heart on that day, and Sri Krishna’s effort to help him overcome it.\nSeeing Arjuna in the agony of sorrow, Sri Krishna questioned him [in verse 2, chapter 2]. If a mirror is stained, we cannot see the reflection correctly. Our heart is like a mirror. If tainted, it loses the ability to reflect things. That is, we cannot understand what ought to be understood, clearly. We lose our natural strengths as well. They get buried. It clouds our heart. This happens at certain times. When a man is overtaken either by grief, or is bustling with enthusiasm - he loses himself. \nIn case of being overcome by sorrow, he loses the ability to think what to do next. In case of being flooded with enthusiasm - he also loses himself. However, there is a slight difference. In the first case, he becomes sort of disabled – unable to take any action. In the second case, he works at a multi-fold level. Let us say the reason for sorrow is that somebody spoke harsh words. The mind is then disturbed. Due to that disturbance, man loses his natural ability. Or if somebody praises a person, then he becomes bustling with energy. He jumps forward to work with multi-fold productivity. \nIf somebody extols the virtues of a person, that person’s excitement knows no bounds. There are some misers who are not interested in donating. Even a miser becomes excited when praised. Or if in a group of people with everyone making donations to a cause, he too feels anxious for recognition and pledges to donate. Not only a pledge, he may actually donate as well. Encouragement given to do noble things is good. Conversely, if somebody keeps pulling a person down by his words, he can even lose his fighting spirit in the midst of a war. \nPeople refer to such a situation as salya sa:rathyam (the demotivation of Karna) - from Karna’s life. When his charioteer Salya kept deriding him, it demotivated him a lot and eventually led to Karna’s downfall in spite of his might. Encouragement given to do a noble deed is very good. Sometimes, this enthusiasm comes from the societal environment that the person is in. Or, it could stem from the teachings of knowledgeable Elders, teachers or a:cha:ryas (spiritual guides). It inspires a generous and helpful nature in the person, and sidelines any of his naturally existing shortcomings, thus making him useful to society. \nIn such cases, where the inspiration is from knowledge-giving Elders, it tends to be permanent. On the contrary, if the person feels sorrow at an inappropriate time, this becomes dangerous. Sri Krishna questions Arjuna about such a situation in the second chapter. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nశ్రీ భగవాన్ ఉవాచ -  \nకుతస్త్వా కశ్మలమిదం,  విషమే సముపస్థితమ్  ।  \nఅనార్యజుష్టమ్ అస్వర్గ్యమ్,  అకీర్తికరమర్జున! ॥\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSri Bhagavan said - \n\"What is this, Arjuna? Why are you grieving at this inappropriate time? This behavior is not suitable for a noble person.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is this, Arjuna? Why are you grieving at this inappropriate time? ‘Kasmalam’ means a blemish or an affliction. What type of affliction are you suffering from now? It is lack of discrimination (yuktha:yuktha-vive:ka-ra:hithyam). You are unable to distinguish between what needs to be done and what needs to be avoided. That is your mental blemish. It is making you lose sight of who you are and what your duty is. This is vishamam (inappropriate) – an inappropriate place for such grief. \nWe discussed this example earlier – If somebody goes to a dining area for sports, that is vishamam – inappropriate. Or if somebody in an athletic arena is simply engrossed in eating, that too is vishamam – inappropriate. “Arjuna! This is a battlefield. So, grieving here is vishamam – inappropriate.” You came here prepared for war, sounding your conch indicating readiness to fight. Everyone is set to start the war. At this moment, you are overtaken by sorrow exclaiming that you will not fight! This is wrong.\nSuch a situation results in three types of harm – What are these three?\n1. ana:rya jushtam (not suitable for a noble person)\n2. asvargyam (not leading to heaven)\n3. aki:rthi-karam (bringing notoriety)\nFirst, this behavior is not a:rya jushtam. Secondly, it is asvargyam. You think by waging war, you will not attain heaven after death. Or since the enemies also waged righteous war (dharma-yuddham), they will be eligible for heaven as well. “If both I, and my opponents - who were tormentors all along - achieve the same heaven, how is this justified?” You are filled with some sort of jealousy. That too is wrong. This untimely grief will result in you not attaining heaven – asvargyam. \nYou might think at least some fame might result if people think “generous Arjuna had left his enemies unharmed in the war, pitying them.” That would be a wrong notion. Nobody will sing your praises like that. On the contrary, people will blame you for not protecting dharma (righteousness). Thus, it will not lead you to fame either. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nఅనార్యజుష్టమ్ అస్వర్గ్యమ్, అకీర్తికరమర్జున! \nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"This behavior is not suitable for a noble person, does not lead to heaven, and brings notoriety to you, Arjuna!\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna spoke of these three flaws [resulting from untimely sorrow]. We need to understand the first flaw in detail, ana:rya jushtam. He says Arjuna’s such behavior will not please A:ryas (noble people). This term ‘a:rya’ is grossly misunderstood. He is saying - “If you refrain from waging war, it will not please A:ryas.” In other words, A:ryas will be delighted only if you wage this war. Here waging the war means – subduing wrong-doers and protecting good people. That will please Elders. \nSri Krishna refers to them as A:ryas. We all learned during our childhood in schools, terms like A:ryans, Dravidians, etc. We learned that A:ryas mean dwellers in the northern side of India. Dravidians are dwellers of South-India. In further lessons, we learnt that these people originated from Egypt or Babylonia and migrated gradually along the banks of rivers and conquered the people of India… and that their skin color is light… and that A:ryas are responsible for setting up the caste system… the remaining people of India are called ‘ana:ryas’ or Dravidians, who were subdued by A:ryas… A:ryas imposed their views and suppressed Dravidians. \nWe all studied such lessons in our books. Hence, we think A:ryas are the ones who conquer and suppress other people. Indeed, that is far from the truth. The term ‘A:rya’ is a very misinterpreted one. The word ‘A:rya’ by itself, is a noble one. However, the idea we are made to believe about that term A:rya, is incorrect. \nWho are A:ryas? It is wrong to say that the tribes who migrated south around 7,000 – 8,000 BCE are called A:ryas. Then who are A:ryas? We see this term – “A:rya” – in our ancient literature extensively as well. In Ramayana, mother Si:tha (supposedly from the A:ryan race) referred to a monkey, who hailed from South India – from the so-called ‘Dravidian’ race as “A:rya!” \n“O Hanuman! You are A:rya, saying that you will punish these demons [as retaliation for causing me misery]. Is this appropriate?” In this case, is Hanuman an A:rya? Or ana:rya / Dravidian? Let’s get this straight. A:ryas do not mean the people who came from elsewhere. Irrespective of whichever region a person belongs to, whatever be his skin color, whichever caste he belongs to… if a person adopts good practices / way of living and is impartial in all aspects… tries to spread good knowledge to the people around him… is always willing to learn from knowledgeable elders… such a person is called an A:rya. A person without these qualities is ‘ana:rya’. This is the definition given by our learned elders. \nWe should not be influenced by concepts given by Westerners regarding this term ‘a:rya’. Let me explain the context to you [of the incident narrated in Ramayana]. Ra:vana was killed in the war. Hanuma:n was sent to Si:tha by Rama to convey a reassuring message - “Lanka is now ours. O Si:tha! You need not fear any longer.” Hanuma:n goes to mother Si:tha and conveys that message. On hearing that message, Si:tha was overjoyed. She says to Hanuma:n – “You have indeed done a great favor. How can I show my gratitude to you?” \nHanuma:n replies – “You have been tortured mentally over past 10 months in Lanka by these rakshasis (demons). Simply give me permission to teach them all a lesson. I will make them suffer much more than what they did to you.” Mother Si:tha responds, – “No, Hanuma! That is not right!” They are just employees following instructions given to them by their employer, the King. Whatever they have done is not wrong. It was their job. Ra:vana employed them just to do that job. They had been doing their job properly, as instructed. If anything, they need to be given incentive. Instead, you want to hurt them. That is not how an A:rya like you should act. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nका:र्यम् करुणमार्येण \nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"You are a noble one, the one who can distinguish what is appropriate and what is not.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nAn intelligent person - a very knowledgeable one. You are one who can distinguish what is appropriate and what is not. It does not befit you to ask like this. In this context, Mother Si:tha addressed Hanuma:n as ‘A:rya!’ Thus, that term refers to Elders (knowledgeable) – irrespective of their species, caste or religion. They know what is good, they encourage good deeds; they stand up for what is right and good. Blessings from such learned people are to be sought by everyone. \nGod says - “So, dear Arjuna! If you say you will not wage war at this time, that will not be appreciated by A:ryas.” Hence such an act will be labeled ‘ana:rya jushtam’. Saying so, Sri Krishna is inspiring Arjuna to realize himself and take up his duty. He will subsequently start teaching how Arjuna can carry out his rightful duty in the second chapter. We will get to know how He does that, as we continue. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Gurus or a:cha:ryas (teachers) are those who teach us what our duties are. God inspires and protects such a:cha:ryas. That God incarnated as Sri Krishna. One of God’s deeds is to bring a capable yet strayed person back on track and carry out righteous activities for society through that person. Hence, Bhagavad Gita chapter 2 starts with Sri Krishna inspiring Arjuna to carry out righteous deeds.\nArjuna slumped in the battlefield, not wanting to fight the war. He felt compassion towards the unworthy Kauravas. He thinks that hurting Kauravas will make them sorrowful. He will be deprived of happiness after winning the kingdom. Why? Because if he vanquishes them in the war, with whom will he share his joy? He will be deprived of joy as there will be none around with whom he can share his happiness. That was the thought process of Arjuna. This thought process made the capable and efficient Arjuna incapacitated and inactive. This condition is called ‘kli:batha’ – ‘klaibyam’ (cowardice).\nSri Krishna’s efforts are to free Arjuna from this kli:batha via His upade:sa (teaching) to him in Bhagavad Gita chapter 2.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nklaibyam ma:smagamah pa:rttha!\nnaithath thawy yupapadyathe: I\nkshudram hrudaya dourbalyam\nthyakthva: u:tthistta paranthapa ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“O Arjuna! Do not succumb to this cowardice! This is not befitting for you. Cast off this weakness of heart and arise, O scorcher of enemies!”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna addresses Arjuna, “You are a paranthapa!” The word paranthapa has two meanings. First - the one who subdues and conquers wrongdoings of another, however valorous and mighty that person might be. One who suppresses (thapa) and defeats the evil deeds of others (para) is a paran + thapa, paranthapa. Arjuna has such capabilities and has proved it many times. Whether Indra or Agni de:vatha (gods), if their actions were wrong or if he had to do a task, he did it successfully and proved himself. He became a paranthapa! Not just this, he has another quality also. He is paranthapa.\nThe second meaning of paranthapa is that param (ultimate truth or goal) is that which is worthy of knowing. In Thiruppavai songs, Goda Devi says ‘parai’ – ‘parai kolva:n’, ‘parai tharuva:n’. In Tamil, ‘param’ is called ‘parai’. Vedas dictate that the goal of life is to attain this ‘param’. You are that person whose thoughts are attuned towards achieving this param. You are the able one who can delineate the reality to realize that goal. You are a param thapa! How come you are in this state now? ‘klaibyam ma:smagamaha!’ Don’t be possessed by ‘klaibyam’. Else, you will be fit for nothing. You can neither enjoy life here nor in the higher worlds. You will become a loser. Thus, Sri Krishna advises Arjuna.\nA person possessed by ‘kli:batha’ (cowardice) will neither be happy nor will keep others happy. Also, he won’t be able to tolerate others’ happiness. For example, old people without teeth can’t chew or munch on snacks or chips. They can’t watch others munching. That very sound irritates them. Recently, during our stay in Nadigaddapalem, a group of people in their 70s and 80s visited our a:sram (ashram). We were distributing nuts to the devotees. Because nuts are hard to bite, we gave them an orange which is soft to chew. “You gave them nuts. Give them to me too,” demanded the old man. We asked, “You don’t have teeth. How will you eat them?” He said, “So what? We will eat it somehow. We can find ways to eat them. If required, we will grind and consume them. It's ok. Give them to us.” \nNot ready to accept reality - they can’t take up the usual activities. Kli:batha is also similar. He can’t be happy nor let others be happy. He becomes fit for neither. How come you have become a prey to kli:bam? That too in this place [battlefield].\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nklaibyam ma:smagamah pa:rttha naithath thawy upapadyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Do not succumb to this cowardice, for this is not befitting for you.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou were in this state once before when you were under a curse. One day Arjuna had gone to visit Indra, the king of de:vathas. Urvasi, the beautiful damsel, wanted to conjugate with him. But, she belonged to the de:vatha clan and was Indra’s partner. As Arjuna respected Indra as his god-father, he felt Urvasi was like a mother and thus, rejected her. Angered, Urvasi cursed Arjuna to become a eunuch. Hearing this, Indra felt bad. He felt it was not appropriate for Arjuna to live his whole life as a eunuch since he was so capable and helpful - born as his amsa (part). Hence, Indra reduced the time period of the curse given by Urvasi to one year. He also let Arjuna choose the time when to live like a eunuch. This curse became a boon when the Pandavas were in exile, especially for Arjuna. During the year of exile while staying in the residence of King Virata, Arjuna disguised himself as Bruhannala, a dance teacher to teach the king’s daughter. Thus, for that one year, he experienced the curse of Urvasi. The curse helped him.\nThose days are over now! You are no longer in exile. Stop acting like a eunuch Bruhannala. You can’t declare that you won’t fight in war and simply collapse to the ground. This is not the right attitude!\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnaithath thawy yupapadyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“This is not befitting for you.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou were freed from this condition the moment your exile ended, said Sri Krishna. Arjuna asks, “What should I do now?” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthyakthva: hrudaya daurbalyam\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Leave the weakness that has enveloped your mind.”\n-----------------------------------------------\n“Leave it, uththishta (get up), do your duty.” Thus, Sri Krishna was addressing Arjuna, asking him how he was inflicted with this cowardice. You should not be in this state. \nFacing a similar situation, Hanuman thought, “I won’t live anymore! All this happened because of my act! I came here in search of Sita, but I can’t find her! If I go back now and tell them, Rama and Lakshmana... along with Sugriva, all the Vanaras, Bharatha, Shatrughna, their mothers, the ministers… the whole of Ayodhya and Kishkindha will be destroyed!!” Unnecessary thoughts, extreme thoughts! Even you are in the same state! Bringing up all ‘big’ topics! Talking about ancestors, their abode, their befallen state! Why talk about all these? Forgetting and holding off from your duty... It doesn’t benefit you speaking of overly complicated topics now. Now, you must do the duty ordained to you.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthyakthva: uththishta: paranthapa \nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Leave this and be prepared to jump into action.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nBe prepared to jump into action! Uththishta, uththishtattha ja:gratha prapyavara:n nibodhatha: (wake up and act accordingly) dictates the Upanishads to the whole human race. Stop unnecessary thoughts. Stop futile actions. Identify your duty. Wake up and act accordingly! \nBecause it is tough to perform the duties of a human being, it’s like walking on a double-edged sword. One must carefully comprehend and act accordingly. Hence, our Elders say, it’s easier to be a de:vatha (god) or a tree or an animal or a bird. However, it is very tough to be a human being. You might question, “How is this so? We are all humans!?” That’s the catch… We’ve all been gifted with this human body, but do not have the conduct of a human being. \nIt is analogous to dressing up an inefficient person in a cop's uniform and giving him a gun. Can one become a police officer simply by wearing the uniform? Can one become a great warrior simply by holding a gun? He could be so frail that he would be frightened and run away by a small gust of wind. How dangerous is it? There is every chance for him to be attacked, robbed of his own weapon, and get killed. Just dressing up won’t help. It is of help only when one knows what to do. \nWe all got this human body because of the effect of some good deed in our past lives. However, now, we are unable to attain the state of behaving as a human being. Hence, we are inflicted with pandemics such as Corona, etc. Yet, many are taking advantage of this situation due to lack of humanity. People from various fields are exploiting the situation in their own way and making money. This is all because of a lack of humanity. \nOur sages defined what it means to be a human being. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmathva: karma:ni si:vyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Know what’s good, implement and conduct accordingly.”\n-----------------------------------------------\n1 - Know about oneself  \n2 - Know one’s responsibility in the family  \n3 - Know one’s responsibility in the community  \n4 - Know one’s responsibility towards other beings and nature  \n5 - Know one’s responsibility towards the Supreme Lord who controls the whole Universe  \nKnow about these five, coordinate and act accordingly. You must think from all five angles and act accordingly. A true human being is one whose conduct in life is driven by converging the responsibilities at all the five levels, such that none of them, neither society, family, nor he are troubled or compromised. His mindset would be considered incomplete if he misses even one of these levels. \nFocusing on only one category and neglecting all others disqualifies him as a human being. A few worship only Nature, not believing in God… Some love only God and neglect society and Nature… Some care only about society and ignore other aspects. While others love only their own body, claiming they don’t care about anything else. Neglecting even one category will not make it whole. It's incomplete. Hence, all five categories should be taken care of. \nTake care of your body, keeping it healthy. Safeguard your family and be comfortable. Love society and live together. Understand Nature and other beings and let them live peacefully in their respective places. Realize the presence of the Supreme and live your life accordingly. A human being is one who can blend all these factors and live in a way not causing discomfort or disturbance to any. That is called mananam (reflection). \nA:lo:chana (thought process) is where thinking aligns in this way. A:charana (action) is where such a:lochana is brought into action. Living life as a human being is to synchronize a:lochana, right thought process, and a:charana, corresponding action. This is very difficult. Hence, God dedicated one entire incarnation, Sri Rama avatha:r (incarnation), to show mankind how difficult it is. He is a good human, the best one, the best among the best, purusho:tthama (the supreme person). He led life learning and following the limits, marya:da purusho:tthama (the ideal human being), Sri Rama! Hence, we worship him even today. \nIf you too can be one who follows limits and lives accordingly, society will worship you more than God Himself, despite being a human being. You need not go behind de:vathas (gods). All de:vathas will run behind you. You need not strive to get into others’ good books to earn their mercy. Instead, everyone will run after you to get your mercy. Hence, even today, we are building temples for Sri Rama because he is a perfect human being. \nLord gave this upade:sa (teaching) to mold us into real human beings. We need to give up this ‘klaibya’ (cowardice) to transform into real human beings. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nklaibyam ma:smagamah  \nthyakthva: hrudaya dourbalyam\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Leave this obnoxious weakness in mind.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nUththishta (get up)! Be willing to do your duty. Act now! Thus, Sri Krishna is giving this upade:sa to remind Arjuna of his duty... to make us all duty-oriented… Let us learn how, further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), today we will explore the significance of the mind (manas) in our lives. The mind is the most important instrument for a human being. If this mind is healthy, you can face anything. However, if the mind is weak, a person becomes a slave even to the simplest of things. Elders and sages (rushis) have stated in scriptures that it is crucial to keep the mind healthy. They have also provided us with various means to achieve this.\nA well-equipped, purified mind is our good friend, while an uncultured mind (lacking in good qualities) is our strong enemy. The impact of the mind on us is more critical than the effect of external friends and enemies. If we want everyone to treat us kindly, we must train our mind to be good.\nThe difficulties, challenges, or defects caused by the mind are referred to as a:dhya:thmika tha:pa:s (sorrows caused by the mind). There are three kinds of sorrows known as tha:pa thrayas: a:di bhouthika (sorrows caused by external beings), a:di daivika (sorrows caused by natural forces), and a:dhya:thmika (sorrows caused by the mind).\nA:di bhouthika tha:pa:s arise from the beings (bhu:thas) around us. A:dhi daivika tha:pa:s are caused by the life-supporting forces of nature. A:dhya:thmika refers to those caused by the mind itself.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI bow repeatedly to Lord Rama, who removes all obstacles and grants all wealth.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe scriptures teach us that the word a:thma (soul) has many meanings. Depending on the context, we should take the meaning that is relevant. Here, it is used to indicate the mind. The problems related to the mind are called a:dhya:thmika problems.\nBhu:thas are the formed substances around us. Anything visible is a substance—moving or non-moving, small or big, living or non-living. All these were formed at some point, hence they are called bhu:thas. The difficulties caused by these beings, which are made of fire, water, earth, and air, are called a:di bhouthika tha:pa:s.\nFor instance, if a rock or a thorn pierces our feet, it causes us pain. If a mosquito bites us, we feel discomfort. These are some inconveniences we face. Sometimes we may eat something that causes disturbances in our stomach. Such pain or difficulty is also caused by a form created by nature around us. All these are referred to as a:di bhouthika tha:pa:s or sorrows.\nWe may also face sorrows or difficulties from our pets or wild animals, which are also a:di bhouthika tha:pa:s. Additionally, we may encounter difficulties from people (friends, relatives, or others) around us, whether they are favorable or unfavorable. All these beings are called bhu:thas. Both objects and beings are referred to as bhu:thas.\nBhavathi ithi bhu:tha (It becomes, hence it is called bhu:tha). Whatever is around us and visible to our eyes is called bhu:tha. All the difficulties caused by them are called a:di bhouthika tha:pa:s. We need freedom from these sorrows. They won’t stop; they keep affecting us. However, we should strive to reach a stage where we are not in sorrow because of them. We should be able to overcome a:di bhouthika tha:pa:s.\nThe second type is a:di daivika. De:vas (divine beings) are the life-supporting forces around us. They are not visible but have an impact on us. This impact is often subtle, arising naturally from the environment. For example, when we feel the air move and feel cold, or when we notice an increase in the intensity of sunlight, these experiences are due to nature’s forces. If these forces cause us difficulty or inconvenience, it is called a:di daivika tha:pa or dhu:kha (sorrow).\nA:dhya:thmika tha:pa:s are those we create for ourselves in our minds. In reality, the troubles we experience may not be real, but we feel their presence, leading to pain. These are caused by the mind. If we can correct the issues caused by the mind, we can overcome whatever is caused by the forces of nature or bhu:thas.\nIt is essential to remember that without mental strength, even if we have other resources, they won’t be of much use to us. Therefore, it is crucial for us to focus on the mind. This focus is not as important for animals or other beings, but it is vital for human beings. The existence of a person is validated by the mind.\nMan’s growth is achieved by focusing on the mind. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmana e:va manushya:na:m ka:ranam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe mind is indeed the cause of a human being's success or failure.\n-----------------------------------------------\nFor everything, the mind is the primary reason. Hence, to keep the mind firm and efficient, we must consider the foods we eat, the beverages we consume, the environment we are in, the clothes we wear, and even our hairstyles or other adornments. All these factors contribute to creating a favorable state for the mind.\nOur Elders have established guidelines regarding recommended and prohibited foods based on this understanding. Some people may question, “Why shouldn’t we see this, eat that, or drink this?” They wonder why certain foods are acceptable while others are not. However, we may not be capable of thinking critically about this on our own. We need guidance to find the right path.\nWho will guide us? Those with past experience can provide this guidance. For instance, to guide Rama on the right path, Viswamitra had to come forward due to his extensive experience. Although Rama already had Vasishta as his Guru, it was felt that none of the others in Dasaratha’s court were entirely suitable to train Rama, which is why Viswamitra was brought in.\nViswamitra had gained comprehensive experience but was initially weak in mind. When he saw something good, he had a tendency to covet it for himself. This weakness led him to attempt to take a cow from his Guru’s ashram by force. He made many efforts and performed penances to acquire what he desired. To overcome his mental weakness, he traveled extensively and practiced diligently.\nFortune favored him, and his efforts were fruitful. As a result of his great penance, he developed significant mental strength. He learned to withstand disturbances without being affected, achieving great inner strength. Just as a chimney protects a lit lamp from the wind, Viswamitra became impervious to external influences.\nAfter completing his penance for 10,000 years, just as he was about to partake in prasa:da (food offered to God), Indra, the Lord of heaven, came disguised as a brahmin and begged for food. Viswamitra recognized Indra but chose not to be angry. Instead, he felt compelled to offer food to Indra and returned to his practice without disturbance.\nSince he had controlled his mind through practice, Valmiki portrays Viswamitra as capable of guiding Rama on the correct path. The mind is not something we can see. If it were visible, we could manage it more easily. Although we cannot see or access it, the mind is crucial for achieving good or bad outcomes.\nThat’s why we must cultivate our mind favorably through the food we eat, the drinks we consume, the clothes we wear, the way we speak, the imagery around us, the society we engage with, and the friends we keep. We should strive to make our mind good through all these influences. Fortunately, Arjuna had such companionship. A capable person like Sri Krishna became his guide, able to dispel any doubts he had. This was indeed his good fortune.\nArjuna’s heart was overwhelmed by a mental weakness, which Krishna observed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nklybham masmadamaha pa:rtha\nkshuddhram hrudaya dourbalyam\nthyakthva utthishta paranthapa\nSLOKA MEANING -\nO Partha (Arjuna), do not succumb to this weakness of heart, which is unworthy of you. Arise and stand up, O conqueror of enemies!\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis mental weakness is detrimental. If we harbor mental weakness, it signifies that all faults have entered us, serving as a precursor to disaster. Therefore, if we can first address this weakness, we can achieve what we need to accomplish.\nLet us continue our journey along with Krishna in Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, as He encourages Arjuna to fulfill his duty. \nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), If our manas (mind) is in a good state, then we can achieve anything. We should attain control of the manas and then approach an a:cha:rya (teacher). If the manas is in a state of despair, one needs to take shelter of a sada:cha:rya (qualified guru) to thrive. A:cha:rya can guide us toward the right path. Upanishad declares this.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npari:ksha lo:ka:n karma chittha:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf we observe situations around us, their outcomes, and weigh the resulting good and bad in them…\n-----------------------------------------------\n…then a journey to understand what these mean commences in our heart. We then question if we should endeavor for things which perish or which don’t. Should we strive for momentary happiness or that which is permanent? Should we desire temporary benefits or long-lasting ones? If the thirst to know arises in our heart, then we approach an a:cha:rya who advises us what is good, stabilizes it in our heart, and increases the faith within.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsa guru me:va:bhi gacche:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWe then need to approach sada:cha:rya with humility in his heart, i.e., as a vini:tha (humble one).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSuch a one must have a sincere desire to learn. It should be evident when one sees him. Whatever rules and means are prescribed to him by an a:cha:rya, he should follow those and satisfy the quest in his heart. He should do as instructed. Faith is very important. But it will be difficult to inculcate that faith on one’s own… as one is not in a position to judge the knowledge of the person being approached. Are we reaching out to the right person or not? Will he be able to guide us on the right path or are we going to fall into a worse state than what we are in? We should know these; however, we will not be in a position to judge appropriately. If we can judge this, then there is no need for us to go to anyone.\nThat is why we all first need sath sang (good association), good company. We need a group of people around us who have our best interests at heart. Since they want what is good for us, whether we like it or not, they will show us the path for our upliftment. They will guide us towards those who can uplift us. The well-wishers would know who they are leading us to, and they might have experienced certain similar situations. So we should definitely accept the path shown by sathsang… and take shelter of sada:cha:rya, qualified guru, shown to us by those well-wishers. Only then, that person can become our guru. Not because we decide by ourselves that someone can be our guru. Otherwise, anyone who encourages any bad habit and teaches the subtleties in it also can be called a guru. However, do we call such a person a guru? No. We need sathsang, good people, who can guide us towards the right path. We need to make efforts to keep ourselves in such good association always.\nIf they guide us based on their experience, then we need to seek a guru. Now when we approach a guru, we have to be a samirpa:nihi (approaching with evident humility). We should wait for the right opportunity to ask questions when we are with them. We should be ready to listen and wait patiently until they are ready to teach us. That is the way to conduct oneself with a guru. Arjuna in Bhagavad Gita neither had such patience nor such humility. He didn't have the opportunity to look for a guru [in the recommended way]. Hence jagada:char:ya (world teacher) Sri Krishna became his charioteer and got ready to teach him the means to make him mentally strong. That is what became Bhagavad Gita. He teaches him the means to enhance mental strength.\nIn the beginning of chapter 2 in Bhagavad Gita… Sri Krishna embarks upon the movement to get him past the tha:pathrayam (three types of sorrow). Arjuna is able to understand what Sri Krishna told him in the past. Sri Krishna said, “You want to call off the war now! You put your bow and arrows down… You came here to fight. You got everyone together and sounded the conch [in readiness]. You raised your bow and arrows ready to fight.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npravruthhe: sastra sampa:the\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“In a few seconds you would have shot those arrows.”\n-----------------------------------------------\n“At this time, when the guilty enemy is standing opposite you ready to wage war… instead of seeing the faults in him, leave alone the thought of punishing him according to those faults… out of weakness of heart, you are feeling, “oh! he is my friend, he is my relative, he is my guru, my grandfather, my grandson, etc.” Why are you ‘seeing’ them like that? This itself is a big mistake, right?”\nIf a living organism like a virus or bacteria enters one’s body and starts spoiling one’s health… if one feels that killing it with medicine is sinful, then that person himself might perish. There is no need to show mercy in that situation. It would be an untimely and inappropriate conduct. Hence, such an act [untimely mercy] is prohibited. Whatever needs to be done must be done for sure. For a harmful bacteria, a vaccine must be discovered to eradicate it. In order to put an end to the coronavirus pandemic, everyone in the world is eagerly waiting… to see who is going to produce the vaccine, when is it going to come, which country is going to produce it… which company is going to produce it and who is going to produce it first.” Everyone is anxious to know. Isn’t it a form of violence as well? Is anyone questioning that it involves violence? Instead, everyone is eagerly awaiting the vaccine!\nThe government is working hard, applying different means to issue warnings and precautions. Whatever violence is done to correct faults at a major scale is not considered violence. If your actions cause pain to more people, giving happiness to only a few, that is considered as a fault or violence. Hence, Arjuna, by waging this war, you will only get punya (merit) and not pa:pa (sin). If you stop this war and let go of these people without killing them… you may think you will go to heaven, but instead, you will certainly result in hellish worlds. You might be thinking that Elders will praise you for not waging war… instead, they will feel sorry for you and be hurt that you have fallen to such a level.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nana:rya jushtam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHence, this is not something which will make the Elders happy.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nasvargyam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt leads to hell.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou may be thinking none of that matters as long as you are considered good in this world. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naki:rthikaram Arjuna\nSLOKA MEANING -\nyou will not attain fame in this world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nEven if you are alive, people will talk bad about you. That’s why it is aki:rthi karam (brings disgrace), ana:rya jushtam (not worthy of respect), and asvargyam (leads to hell). Sri Krishna showed the above 3 faults in Arjuna's thought process. Arjuna is understanding half of it but the rest is not clear to him. He realizes what Sri Krishna is pointing out in him are faults, but he doesn’t want to give them up. He is unable to firmly state that he will not wage war despite any consequences. At the same time, he is unable to be bold and wage war too.\nSome argue that there is no God. They are unable to prove that God does not exist; at the same time, their heart does not accept the existence of God. They are unable to contradict what the other person is saying as well. Just like a person suffering with many dilemmas, Arjuna feels what Sri Krishna is saying is correct… and that he should wage war, but his heart is not allowing him to do so. Some kind of weakness has conquered Arjuna’s heart and Sri Krishna is asking him to overcome it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nutthishta - wake up\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is not good Arjuna, only when you are courageous, you will get the boldness to act.\n-----------------------------------------------\nOnly when you are bold enough to act, you can work. And when you work you will get back things which you lost… and acquire that which belongs to you. If you passively give up, you will not achieve anything. Leave this kli:batha (helplessness), be enthusiastic. Stop worrying, get up, don’t give up. Sri Rama also once felt sad as described in Ramayana. Sri Rama was very worried when searching for Sita. Noticing this, Lakshmana wanted to somehow give him hope. In Kishkinda Kanda, he gave an excellent upade:sa (teaching).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nartho:hi nashta ka:rya:rthi:hi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhatever you want to achieve, you cannot achieve it without hard work.\n-----------------------------------------------\nTo do that hard work, you need enthusiasm; you can’t work when in despair.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nuthsa:ho bala:va:n a:rya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSri Rama, enthusiasm is more powerful than anything.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna:sthi uthsa:ha:th param balam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou don’t need anything more than enthusiasm. If you have enthusiasm, you will get the rest.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nso:thsa:ha:sth thi lo:ke:smin na kinchid api durlabham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nA mind filled with enthusiasm can achieve anything in the world… nothing is difficult for [one with] it.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nutha:ha:vantha:ha purusha:ha na vasi:danthi karmasu\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose who are enthusiastic are always busy working.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nuthsa:ha ma:thram a:srithya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSo, stop worrying first and be enthusiastic.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thma:na:m na:va buddhyase\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou are unable to understand yourself, Sri Rama.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThat is how Lakshmana warns Sri Rama. Enthusiasm is necessary. With enthusiasm, one gets tremendous mental strength and can achieve anything. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkshuddram hrudaya dourbalyam thyakthva, utthishta paramtapa\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn the beginning of chapter 2, Sri Krishna encourages and orients Arjuna to perform his duty.\n-----------------------------------------------\nLet's learn more as we proceed.

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In Bhagavad Gita chapter 2, Vyaasa Bhagavan (sage Vyasa) explained the various ways sorrow transforms a person, using Arjuna as an example. Arjuna felt sorrow. He felt sorrow in chapters 1 and 2. He experienced one kind of sorrow that marked the beginning of the scripture.\nThere is a difference between the sorrow he felt in chapter 1 and chapter 2. In chapter 1, when he saw his enemy’s army, those who were ready to fight with him, he thought of them as his relatives instead of viewing them as enemies. \nA man is a father in his son’s view, a son in his father’s view, a grandson in his grandfather’s view, a husband in his wife’s view, and a brother in his brother’s view. Thus, each person has their viewpoint. The same exists with the Kauravas too. If one can see what needs to be seen in that context and time, only then can it be said that a person has proper vision. If one sees what need not be seen at the wrong time, it implies that the person is deficient in vision, i.e., sick.\nIf he is going to war and he feels lustful, or at the time of feeling lusty, he feels valorous as if he is in the battlefield, that’s dangerous. A healthy person’s quality is to be able to see and feel the way he is supposed to in a given context and time.\nIn chapter 1, when Arjuna came to wage war, he referred to those in the opponent’s army as durbuddhi (evil-minded). Arjuna said,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nDha:rthara:shtrasya durbuddhe: yuddhe: priya chiki:rshaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"All these people came to give happiness to the wicked-minded Dhrutharashtra, come let's have a look at them.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nBut once he saw them, he saw them as his relatives and felt sorrow. That sorrow grew to such an extent that he started thinking unnecessary things, threw down his bow and arrow, and sat down, unable to act. This is the sorrow Arjuna experienced in the first chapter. This continued in the second chapter too. But this wasn’t the sorrow Arjuna felt seeing all his relatives.\nSri Krishna motivated Arjuna by saying,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nUtthishta Paranthapa\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"Arjuna, it is not right to stop the war due to unnecessary thoughts out of weakness of heart.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna then expressed his sorrowful state in Bhagavad Gita 2:4 verse.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nKatham bhi:shmam aham sankhye: dro:nam cha madusu:dhana\nYushubhi prathiyo:thsya:mi pu:ja:rhou ari su:dana\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"How can I fight against Bhishma and Drona, O Krishna? I cannot shoot arrows at my own teachers and relatives.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna asked a wonderful question to Sri Krishna. We don’t know if he questioned him out of challenge, demand, or love. It sounds like a request made in a prayerful mood, but we also see a challenging spirit or a kind of taunt meant to pierce the other person’s heart in this question. \nLet's analyze it. We can only recognize it based on the words in it. Words are very powerful. They can be used to uplift or to harm. Instead of using our imagination, we need to recognize them based on the impact of the words used.\nLet's look at the words Arjuna used, “katham bhi:shmam - Should I strike Bhishma now in war?” He asked that because Bhishma, Drona, and others were in front of him. Dharmaraja (Yudhishthira) didn’t have this doubt. Because he is wise, he doesn’t have any weaknesses in his heart as he is “Yudhishthira,” someone who is firm regarding his duty. \nBut Arjuna is not like that. He thinks he is firm but is actually a weak person. There is no danger if an ignorant person behaves like an ignorant person and a learned man behaves like a learned man. If an ignorant person behaves like a learned man and a wise one behaves like an ignorant person, all kinds of problems happen. \nThe danger here is Arjuna is ignorant but posing like a learned man. What does he know and what does he not know? He knows Bhishma and Drona and his relation with them. But does he actually know it? We don’t know. He stood alone and fought against the same Bhishma and Drona during the incident of Uththara Kumara’s Go:grahana (stealing of cows). \nRight now, as they are fighting a huge war, Arjuna has an army of 7 Akshauhinis, a battle formation of a huge number of chariots, cavalry, elephants, etc., supporting him. But in the last phase of Ajna:thava:sa (living incognito), when the Kauravas conquered the kingdom of Virat and tried to steal the cows, the same Arjuna fought all of them alone with no army and put everyone to sleep in the opponent’s army. \nIt is said that not just putting them to sleep, Arjuna cut the edges of turbans of those in the opponent's army and made Uththara Kumara present them to his sister as a gift. Let’s keep that aside for now. But at that time, did Arjuna hesitate to fight against Drona or Bhishma? He didn’t! That’s because he was in the right frame of mind then. \nBut now, he got into this pitiful state. Sri Krishna was the one orchestrating these changes in Arjuna’s heart. It was necessary to give a great sadupadesa (right teaching) to the world through Arjuna. So to make Arjuna an instrument, Sri Krishna was creating a suitable maturity in his heart. \nHence, Arjuna developed this weakness in his heart. In today's world, most common people are suffering from these weaknesses. We are also like him. In some situations, we also experience this weakness of heart. We need to be given some means to overcome this weakness or to gradually suppress it. \nKeeping in mind the upcoming Kaliyuga (age of darkness), knowing that a lot of people would experience such weaknesses in different ways and in different situations, Jagadacharya (teacher of the world), guru to the world Sri Krishna, thinking of all the people as his own, wanted to give a subtle but very powerful instrument to counteract it. \nHe was therefore creating the right kind of situation and was making Arjuna an excuse for it. The calf is an excuse for the cow to give us milk. Thinking of himself as a cowherd and Arjuna as the calf who drinks the milk, Lord Sri Krishna was making efforts to give the nectar of Bhagavad Gita to us. \nArjuna was saying, “katham Bhishmam - how can I fight against Bhishma?” “Yushubhi prathiyo:thsya:mi - you want me to attack him with arrows and wage war against him?” So what? An enemy is an enemy, right? How does it matter who he is? \nArjuna: “Actually, when Bhishmacharya was very young, to keep up the vow which he gave to his father, Bhishma has been taking care of us (those in Kuru dynasty) for three generations. He has been a protector of the throne of the Kaurava kingdom since then. When Bhishma’s father King Shantanu wanted to marry Satyavati, the young Bhishma made a vow to protect whoever is sitting on the throne of the Kaurava kingdom and mentor them in ruling the Kaurava kingdom properly. \nBhishma remained faithful to his vow. Since childhood, he has brought us up carefully, carrying us in his lap. That generous Bhishma who did such great favors to us and brought us up. Yo:thsya:mi - should I wage war with him and strike him? “Prathi yo:thsya:mi - should I stand against him as his opponent in war?” \n“This is a terrible thing to do. Yushubhi prathi yo:thsya:mi - that too, attacking him with arrows?” Sometimes, a father or grandfather might stand like an opponent and encourage someone to shoot arrows at them, and they also shoot arrows at him, but that is only for the sake of teaching them. \nBut this war where they are standing on opposite sides, yushubhi prathi yo:thsya:mi, is not for teaching or training or testing. “Sankhye: yushubhihi prathi yo:thsya:mi - this is a real war to take their lives, not an act of training or testing. How can I do this to him?” \nBut actually, Arjuna shouldn’t be saying that. Because the mistake which Bhishma committed was not a minor one. For that mistake, Sri Krishna should have punished him right then. For the sin of viewing a woman being humiliated in front of the assembly, for giving support to those who wanted to disrobe and mistreat a woman, for seeing it and tolerating it, Bhishma should have lost his life right then. \nHe needs to be punished sometime. He might be your grandfather, given you shelter, protected the throne, and brought you up lovingly by carrying you in his lap, but the sin he committed was not an ordinary sin. It is a big sin to just watch a lady get humiliated. \nThere are two ways to respond. If one has the strength, he should immediately go and try to stop it, to protect her and punish those who humiliated her. This should be done. Bhishma had that power to do it but he didn’t use it. Or if for some reason one is unable to protect that lady or punish the one insulting her, one shouldn’t sit like a statue watching it; one should leave the place immediately. Why should one sit and watch it? \nThat day Bhishma, Drona, and others just sat there watching the atrocities being committed against Draupadi in front of the whole assembly. This was a grave sin they committed. It deserved punishment by the ruler. But the ruler wasn’t qualified enough to award punishment then. \n“Now it became necessary for us to award them the right punishment.” Hence, you should do that now. How can you say katham bhi:shma yushibhih prathi yo:thsya:mi…!? “This MUST be done. It is improper for you to say that you don’t want to wage war with Bhishma.” \nWeren’t there a lot of others on that day in the assembly including Dharmaraja, this very Arjuna, and the Pandavas? Yes, they were there. Actually, all of them should be killed too for sitting idle and tolerating the insult of a lady. \nHowever, the same Draupadi who must be made happy by punishing her offenders will lose her mangalasutra (nuptial thread) if the Pandavas are harmed. The great acharya, Pillai Lokacharya said,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\navaludaya mangala su:thrathakka:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"they are her nuptial thread.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nActually, the situation was such that both Pandavas and Kauravas should have been harshly punished. Sri Krishna left the five Pandavas alive because they are Draupadi's husbands. Sri Krishna was planning to punish Draupadi’s offenders to make her happy. \nThat Draupadi would feel sorrow if he caused any harm to Pandavas. He left them alive only because he didn’t want to cause pain to Draupadi. Otherwise, along with Kauravas and an army of 18 Akshauhinis, he would have killed the 5 Pandavas too. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nivaludaya mangala su:thratthukka:ha avargalai vaithttha:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"That God left them alive for Draupadi's sake,\" says Pillai Lokacharya.\n-----------------------------------------------\n“Hence Arjuna, whatever you are saying about not wanting to kill Bhishma is not right.” Arjuna is first expressing his ignorance here about Bhishma and talks about Drona further. Let us proceed in Bhagavad Gita chapter 2 understanding further about his expression of sorrow. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Women are the foundation of human society. Hence, it is everyone's duty to protect women. Protecting women means everyone responsibly safeguards well-mannered women, building a system that enforces good manners in them. This is essential for human society to thrive and should be taken care of. Hence, if you protect women properly, you will be blessed with all good fortune and comforts in life. The land where a woman sheds tears becomes home for all misfortunes. This has to be carefully noted. Hence, our Elders teach us to make sure such a situation doesn’t arise. That's why when the girl is young, parents should take extra care. During middle age, the husband should take care and protect her carefully. And in old age, children should take care of her attentively. This is an important moral given by our Elders. If not implemented, it is said that punishment is deserved.\nIn the beginning of the second chapter, when Arjuna looked at the opponent’s commander-in-chief Bhi:shma (grandfather), he saw him as his great grandfather. Arjuna felt, ‘oh, how can I fight with my grandfather?’ \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkatham bhi:shmam sankhye: yushubhi prathiyo:thsa:ni dro:nam cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHow can I fight Dro:na and Bhi:shma with arrows?\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe saw Bhi:shma as his grandfather. Instead, he should have seen him as the person who was watching Draupadi’s humiliation in the assembly hall and tolerating it. Dharmara:j (Yudhishthira) made the same mistake, whereas the other brothers didn’t make this mistake. Bhi:ma was very upset and wanted to do something about it, but since his brother stopped him, he couldn’t do anything. Arjuna was also enraged and wanted to do something in retaliation, but since his brother asked him to stop, he stopped. Nakula and Sahadeva were enraged and wanted to protect her (Draupadi), but since their brother stopped them, they had to stop. Why did Dharmara:j not react? Because they had already lost the dice-game and become the slaves of Kauravas. He followed sa:ma:nya dharma (common etiquette), of not standing against those who are now their ‘owners’ (the Kauravas) and thus remained quiet.\nIdeally, dharma is of two types - sa:ma:nya dharma (common dharma) and vise:sha dharma (specific dharma). Sa:ma:nya dharma:s are norms which are to be followed by everyone in general. But, in some special situations, sa:ma:nya dharma needs to be replaced with specific needs at that time, vise:sha dharma. Dharmara:j was in an unfortunate situation, losing himself and his brothers to Kauravas in a dice game. Dharmara:j felt he shouldn’t retaliate against them as they had become slaves of Kauravas. Still, as a common man, if you see a woman getting humiliated, it is your primary duty to stop it. Dharmara:j forgot that he can do that. He did not know that. If you serve Elders, you will understand vise:sha dharmas like this. You will also realize sa:ma:nya dharmas.\nIn the past, Elders and gurus clearly explained when to follow sa:ma:nya dharmas vs vise:sha dharmas. In the past, we had Elders' support - in vague situations they would explain what was to be followed. Now, we don’t have such a situation. Only houses which have a husband, wife, and two children are considered ideal households. All other members are considered unnecessary. This concept was fed into the hearts of everyone and thus, the situation has changed. If Dharmara:j felt protecting Draupadi was his duty after seeing the difficulties she was put through, then the situation would have been different. In addition, she is Sri Krishna’s sister, a devotee. To remove the difficulties of a devotee and to protect her is anyone’s primary duty. Dharmara:j couldn’t even realize this vise:sha dharma. To properly realize it, you need to serve Elders. That’s why he had to be sent 12 years to the forest and 1 year in ajna:tha va:sa (living incognito).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nabhiva:dana seelasya nityam vrudda:opa sevina:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever serves and bows down to Elders, with humility, their longevity grows…\n-----------------------------------------------\n…they gain prajna (good knowledge). Poor Dharmara:j didn’t have the prajna to recognize vise:sha dharma. That’s why he had to be left to roam in the forest for 12 years. Whoever serves Elders, their yashas (fame) grows and then bala (strength) grows. Physical, mental, and intellectual strength - this all improves when serving Elders. Without serving Elders, or studying texts, one doesn’t achieve this. “I will simply learn just from my own life experiences.” This is not enough.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nanadhi:thyacha sha:stra:ni vru:ddha:n anupase:vyacha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFirstly, one has to learn scriptures from a qualified guru.\n-----------------------------------------------\n“Books are available in the market, we can read them ourselves…” “…Google can get me any info I want. So, that’s enough - we don’t need to seek others” - this thought process is flawed. It is essential to seek and attain knowledge from Elders in the appropriate way. One has to learn scriptures from a qualified guru. Only then, one will know right vs wrong; responsible for vs not responsible for; allowed versus prohibited. This [reading scriptures] gives knowledge of only one part. The rest of the parts can only be gradually learnt by serving Elders. The marma (hidden essence) of the scriptures you read can only be understood by doing upa:sana (worship) of Elders. If you stay with Elders, you get to learn from their teachings in different types of situations.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvru:ddha:n anupase:vya:cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nUnless you take shelter of the wise and listen to their instructions, you won’t be able to know the good that needs to be learnt.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBecause Hanuma:n served sages very well, he was able to speak beautifully. That's what Sri Ra:ma said about Hanuma:n. Sri Ra:ma also did the same, that’s why He was able to recognize Hanuma:n. Jna:na vruddha (knowledge gained), vayo: vruddha (age gained), si:la vruddha (character gained) and bahavaha paryupa:sithaha (many served). Wherever possible and whenever He had time, Sri Ra:ma would take shelter of jna:nis (wise people) and gain whatever knowledge possible from their experiences. Sri Ra:ma always took effort to do that. The people who were living in Ayo:dhya talk about Sri Ra:ma…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nasthra yo:gya anthare:shwapi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nRa:ma was learning archery from a teacher, who took a break after 1-1.5 hours of teaching to recharge.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDuring that break, Ra:ma would serve the Elders who were present and learn more topics of interest from them instead of resting. Ra:ma always did that. Even during the days in his exile, close to 10.5 years, Ra:ma kept visiting a:shramas (hermitages) for 10.5 years. Starting with A:thri and Anasu:ya a:shram, he went to Sarabangha a:shram, then to Agasthya a:shram in the end - and visited all other sages’ ashrams in between. He would stay for approx ½, 1, 2, 3, or 5 days in each a:shram. If a large a:shram, he would stay for up to 15 days. Imagine how many a:shramas were there in Dandaka:ranya to visit for a period of 10.5 years in this manner! What was He doing in those ashramas? He didn’t go to see the natural scenery or take thi:rtha prasa:da (sanctified offerings), or even to rest. He went for vrudda upasevanam (to take shelter of Elders), to learn topics of interest from them and to teach others.\nOnce He went to Panchavati and built a hut to live in… many saints came and started complaining about the troubles given to them by Khara and Dhu:shana. He would associate with those saints, listen to their troubles, give them solace, and promise to take care of their troubles. Only by serving Elders regularly can we gain the supreme knowledge. When Dharmara:j did not take action to protect Draupadi, it indicates that he was deficient in such knowledge from seeking Elders’ shelter. That’s why he was sent to forests for 12 years. He roamed the forests and took shelter of many sages like Na:rada, Ma:rkandeya, and Galavya. He had to enhance his experience by learning from all their teachings. That's why he was able to stand firm in the war today.\nWere the younger Pa:ndavas present where their elder brother Dharmara:j associated with the saints? We don’t know if all the 5 Pa:ndavas heard it. However, Dharmara:j would have humbly inquired and learnt from them. That's why Arjuna now has questions as to how he could kill his grandfather Bhi:shma. He used two words, madhu-su:dana (killer of the Madhu demon) and ari:-su:dana (killer of enemies). He used these two words sarcastically. Why? It is true that these are Sri Krishna's names. However, Arjuna was reminding Sri Krishna that He is madhu su:dana not bandhu (relatives) su:dana. “Sri Krishna, you killed a demon Madhu but did you kill your relatives? However, you are asking me to kill my grandfather!”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmadhusu:dana! katham prathi yo:thsya:mi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHow can I fight, O killer of the Madhu demon?\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe need to carefully observe the actual intent of the words. “You are satru nira:saka (enemy destroyer) not bandhu nira:saka (relative destroyer), right? You killed your enemies, not your relatives.” “But you are asking me to do the opposite! Is that fair?” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkatham prathi yo:thsya:mi, madhusu:dana!\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHow can I fight, O killer of the Madhu demon!\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe second term is ari su:dana. Ari means enemy, Hari means Vishnu. “Sri Krishna, are you ari su:dana or mithra (friend) su:dana? You always killed your enemies, but not your friends.” “You are asking me to kill my relatives and friends, is this right on your part?” Even if we have well-wishers who try to teach us good things, the sorrow caused by our ignorance might make us reject them as well. Forget about trying to learn from them, we might even dishearten those who came to teach us. Sorrow has that kind of power. We have to carefully observe it. If we want to progress, we have to make efforts to keep that sorrow aside. We have to always serve Elders and walk in the path shown by them. Vya:sa bhagava:n (sage Vya:sa) clearly depicts this in this verse. What else does Arjuna’s question bring to light about others, including Dro:na? Let’s learn as we move ahead. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Humans are intelligent beings. The primary duty of a human being is to actively work towards enhancing his or her intelligence. Pride is the most significant inhibitor to intelligence. It makes one ignorant. This ignorance makes one act unfavorably, resulting in deep sorrow. Effects of such sorrow are not limited to oneself. Once affected, people need life-long treatment - similar to conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes requiring constant medication. The ignorance caused by sorrow not only hurts the self but also provokes one to disobey or blame even his well-wishers.\nThis can be observed in the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2, sloka 4. Arjuna questions Sri Krishna...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkatham bhi:shmam aham sankhye: dro:ṇam cha madhusu:dana |\nishubhih prathiyo:thsya:mi pu:ja:rha:varisu:dana!||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“How can I shoot arrows at Bhīṣma and Droṇa, O Krishna, who are worthy of my respect?”\n-----------------------------------------------\n“You killed enemies, but you are asking me to kill my Gurus! You killed enemies, ra:kshasas (demons) and came to be known as Arisu:dana (the one who destroys enemies). However, you never had to attack relatives, friends, or supporters.” “However, you are asking me to wage war against my supporters and my relatives. How is that appropriate?” \nArjuna’s ignorance made him question and mock Sri Krishna. Arjuna specifically questioned about two key people; he didn’t seem overly worried about others. The rest of the opponents were various other a:cha:ryas (teachers), relatives, or distant friends whom he could potentially wage war with. He didn’t seem to be grieving about these other people, specifically those mentioned in chapter 2. In the first chapter, he expressed his sorrow in general for all. In chapter 2, sloka 4, he is specifically concerned about these two. One is his a:cha:rya and the other is his grandfather. Therefore, he mentions only them by name.\nIn chapter 2 through sloka 10, we see that he agonized about these two exclusively. He felt agonized about Bhīṣma because he is ‘Bhīṣma the Great’, he who remained celibate, renounced all his desires and happiness for the sake of the kingdom’s welfare all the way through his old age. He is the one who raised and taught them everything. He [Arjuna] felt, “How do we wage war against him?” This was Arjuna’s sorrow.\nRegarding Droṇa, Arjuna was even more concerned. Droṇa:cha:rya (teacher Droṇa) came to the kingdom to teach them intricacies of asthra-vidya (the art of long-distance weaponry) and sasthra-vidya (the art of stationary hand-held weaponry). With affection, he taught them much. He had more affection and love for Arjuna than for any others. How do we know this? Honestly, Droṇa loves his son Aśvatthāma more than anything. He [Droṇa] was worried that he could not afford basic necessities such as cow milk to feed his son. So he set out to make a livelihood and happened to meet these young princes. They took him along with them to their elders. He was then appointed as their guru in Kuru Kingdom. He was selected based on his unique skills and abilities.\nDroṇa:cha:rya took this role for the sake of his son, forgoing his duty of studying Vedas (sacred texts) etc. Instead, he rendered a Kshatriya’s (warrior's) duty by teaching warfare to princes. Despite all this being for the sake of his son, Aśvatthāma, he taught Arjuna the usage of more asthras (weapons). This reveals how great Droṇa’s love was for Arjuna.\nSpeaking of asthras, there are two primary aspects to learn - releasing and retracting. There are various present-day ballistic missiles similar to asthras. Our people only know how to launch but are unable to retract them once launched. However, in those times, a few skilled students were trained on how to retract these powerful asthras depending on the situation. Droṇa:cha:rya did not teach Aśvatthāma how to retract certain asthras, but he did teach Arjuna.\nFor example, at the end of the Mahābhārata war, Aśvatthāma launched the powerful Nārāyaṇa:sthra (weapon of Lord Vishnu) on the Pāṇḍavas, but did not know how to retract it. Due to the hatred he felt against the Pāṇḍavas at that moment, he decided to destroy them all and released the asthra out of rage. No other asthra is able to counter it. The only way is to use another Nārāyaṇa:sthra itself. So, Arjuna released another Nārāyaṇa:sthra. Both of these together were causing tremendous, massive damage to the world, probably similar to the effects of nuclear radiation. He [Aśvatthāma] did not know how to retract it.\nFollowing Sri Krishna’s order, Arjuna retracted not only his asthra but also Aśvatthāma’s. Thus, Droṇa:cha:rya taught Arjuna many warfare secrets that were not even disclosed to his beloved son, hence, making Arjuna the world’s most skilled and unique archer. One cannot add anyone else to the list of archers of his caliber. He is the one and only.\nTherefore, Arjuna was moved by the generosity of his guru, Droṇa:cha:rya, and questioned...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkatham bhi:shmam dro:nam cha \nishubhih prathiyo:thsya:mi sankhye:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“How can I dare to stand opposite and fight Droṇa, attacking him with arrows? Isn’t that a mistake?”\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe asks, “How can I dare to stand opposite and fight Droṇa, attacking him with arrows? Isn’t that a mistake?” Interestingly, earlier in chapter 1, he called them [Droṇa and Bhīṣma] sinful for not opposing Duryodhana’s actions driven by desire for artha (wealth and power) and kāma (pleasure). They encouraged Duryodhana by staying by his side. Therefore, they also share the blame along with Duryodhana. Don’t they? \nPreviously, Arjuna said, \n….hathva:rtha kama:stu guru:ni haiva …\nSo he is clearly stating that they both were sinful for standing with Duryodhana, who was mired in artha and kāma. This indicates Arjuna has lost consistency in his own words. His ignorance has taken control so he is wondering how he can wage war with them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkatham bhi:shmam aham sankhye: dro:nam cha madhusu:dana!|\nishubhih prathiyo:thsya:mi pu:ja:rha...\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“In fact, I should be praying to them by offering flowers, respecting their knowledge, age, and generosity of teachings.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe says, “In fact, I should be praying to them by offering flowers, respecting their knowledge, age, and generosity of teachings. They deserve to be worshiped. However, you are urging me to fight them with arrows. Sri Krishna, are you being fair?” Arjuna questioned Sri Krishna. \nHowever, it may be that he is using the same words as a form of prayer after he realized. Why? The first reason is the use of the word, ‘Madhusu:dana’. What did you do? In the past, there were two demons, Madhu and Kaitabha. They stole the entire Vedic knowledge that was taught to Brahma [by Lord Vishnu]. It’s not currently our topic to delve into how they stole it. We can revisit that on Mukko:ti Ekādashi.\nAre Vedas in the form of or limited to books? Did books exist back then? How was Brahma taught? Were there any thāla pathras (special natural paper)? Do Vedas mean thāla pathras? Did they forcefully take those away? That’s how it’s depicted these days - as if hitting him and forcefully taking away sets of such books. Imagining that scene, we think this is how Vedas were stolen. \nHowever, Vedas are essentially a knowledge trove residing in the mind. How can that be stolen? Nowadays, we know of various methods of extraction. When hypnotized, all kinds of knowledge can be extracted from someone’s inner psyche. Thus, knowledge extraction is possible. Putting aside if such techniques were used by these demons... ultimately, Madhu and Kaitabha caused Lord Brahma to be devoid of Vedic knowledge. \nIn deep sorrow, Brahma then prayed to God. Pleased with the prayer, Parama:thma (Supreme Soul) searched for demons Madhu and Kaitabha, who were the cause … chased them... defeated them... made them bring back the knowledge... and restored it to Brahma. This is what we hear from history. It means that You, God, are the savior and restorer of lost knowledge.\nArjuna said, “Hey Lord! You are asking me not to be worried, however, I am consumed by ignorance.” “Vedas are the source of all knowledge. When Brahma became deficient of knowledge at one point, You dispelled that ignorance and restored knowledge.” “Thus, You are named Madhusu:dana!” “Therefore today, please dispel ignorance, this demonic enemy within me, and bestow proper knowledge unto me.” Perhaps this is why Arjuna addressed Sri Krishna as Madhusu:dana in his plea!\nNow, the second reason is... You Yourself said…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkshudram hrudaya daurbalyam thyakthvo:ththishtta...\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Cast off this weakness of heart and arise!”\n-----------------------------------------------\n...meaning, you know I have hrudaya dourbalyam (weakness of heart), a weak mind. This is my biggest enemy. “If anyone has enemies when seeking your protection, isn’t it your responsibility to protect them from those enemies?” “Haven’t You done that several times in the past?” “When Sugrīva sought your protection, you killed his enemy Vāli and became Arisu:dana.” “Today, this enemy known as dourbalyam, weakness, is destroying me. Eliminate it. Enable me to recognize your teachings and drive me to fulfill my duty.” “Arisu:dana! That way you will become my Arisu:dana.”\nThus, Arjuna appeared to be presenting his mental state for his betterment and praying to Sri Krishna by referring to Him with the two names [Madhusu:dana and Arisu:dana]. As we continue, we’ll learn about what else he is awaiting to hear from Sri Krishna. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Humans are a species with knowledge as their main unique trait. However, the food consumed, the surrounding environment, and the habits imbibed from the past together have resulted in ignorance engulfing humans, suppressing and even taking control of them. No one is an exception. Even great people had to endure such a state at times. If there is effort and determination, some get the opportunity to gradually eliminate the effect of that ignorance and reawaken knowledge to set them back on the right path.\nEven Arjuna was enveloped by such ignorance. It immersed him into deep sorrow, making him forget his duty. We observe this situation at the beginning of Bhagavad Gita’s 2nd chapter. Anyone who makes mistakes deserves to be punished. It’s one’s responsibility to fight one’s enemies in war. Thus, Arjuna arrived prepared to fight on behalf of the Pa:ndavas. The Kauravas and everyone else came prepared as well. But after arrival, he sees only the relationship with them, declares that he will not fight, and tries to turn back. Sri Krishna then reminds him of his duty and teaches him why it is wrong to give up now. Those teachings are essentially this Bhagavad Gita.\nIn chapter 2 verse 5, Arjuna explains to Sri Krishna about the sorrow caused by his ignorance. Arjuna experiences sorrow seeing Bhi:shma and Dro:na across from him. There are other revered ones as well. They are Elders to him. Because they are a guiding force and can help eradicate ignorance, they are called gurus. It is deemed appropriate to refer to all such Elders respectfully as gurus. Arjuna asks Sri Krishna. This is an example of how sorrow can make one advise others instead of listening to the others’ advice. Arjuna, while engulfed in sorrow, stopped listening to Sri Krishna and started advising Him using his knowledge. How interesting! This is a surprise!\nWhile Sri Krishna is trying to guide him [Arjuna] on what his duty is, Arjuna begins to counter Sri Krishna’s guidance. In such situations, regardless of the manner or how many times advisors try to guide, people tend to promote their own argument based on what they believe in. Even if the advice is from an established source and logical, they won’t be able to absorb it. It is the negative influence of one’s ignorance and sorrow.\nArjuna says...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nguru:na hathva:hi maha:nu bha:van \nsreyo: bho:ktum bhai:ksha mapi:ha loke:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHey Sri Krishna! Gurus! Dro:na and Bhi:shma are my gurus, right? I must not kill them. They are worthy of worship with flowers as this ‘great’ one [Arjuna] thought of earlier. Therefore, they all [gurus] must not be killed. Why? They are all great people.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSo what? Shouldn’t they be punished if they commit a mistake, irrespective of their greatness? No no! Instead of killing such people, I feel it wise to beg for alms to eat until the end of life. Why? If they desire riches, then how do I advise them that it’s not the right thing to do? Is it correct for someone like me to take what they are desiring? Why do I want those pleasures? How can I enjoy those? \nAlso, assume I kill them with my arrows and see their blood-ridden bodies in various miserable states… I’ll be haunted by the same memories as I eat. Even while eating, I would only see the blood-ridden bodies and the gory war field, not the food. That will worsen my sorrow further as I would feel that I am eating the result of all that. How will I be able to cremate their bodies? He asks...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkhatham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nhow do I do it\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis shows that Arjuna is not in a state of listening. He is only in a state of teaching, giving advice, not taking it. What do Elders do in such situations? They try to give advice once or twice. However, he tries to convey his feelings by saying, ‘You are right, but…’ To another explanation, he would respond ‘what you said is fine, but I feel this is better.’ Even though they appear to listen and understand the advice given, they try to tactfully promote their own beliefs, like a fool. He does not make a concerted effort to truly understand the advice given by others.\nElders usually try to guide them a few times, but when they see the pattern of ignorance, they say, ‘go ahead’ and let him carry out their ideas. They then ignore these people and consider it futile attempting to uplift them. They don’t encourage them further, why? Because the strength of what he believes lies in his words. When Arjuna spoke to Sri Krishna, he said...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nguru:na hathva:hi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe appended ‘hi’ meaning ‘isn’t that so?’. He said “It is better to worship them than to kill them, right?” ‘Right? Isn’t that so?’\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat does this expression mean? It implies that ‘what I said is correct and what you said is not. Therefore, you should believe, acknowledge and approve the path that I indicated. Not only is he spoiled, he spoils the other person. Also, he wants approval from others that whatever terrible task he plans to do is justified! That’s how far he brings down others. That’s how he does his dreadful work! This is a wonderful example of how ignorant people work.\nMy a:cha:rya (teacher) used to share a fascinating anecdote. Once an elderly man arrived to perform his mother’s annual ceremony. Generally, Vedic families have yajna su:thra (sacred thread), a sacred thread around the neck after the Upanayana ceremony as a child. They are expected to chant Ga:yathri manthra (Gayatri mantra), learn Vedas, and follow Vedic rituals daily. The thread is meant for these activities, but that elder man didn’t know. So, he simply removed it, and set it aside - feeling it was inconvenient, sliding down the shoulders every now and then. He loved his mother, however. He lived in a city and had the Upanayanam done early in his childhood. He was well educated, went abroad, forgot all the duties and discarded his sacred thread as well.\nWhen he learned of his mother’s demise, he returned to perform the last rites. Initially, he was fully clothed, so it was not apparent to the priest if he was wearing the sacred thread or not. To perform these rites, a man must be bare chested. The priest urged him to do that, so that the thread could be alternated on the shoulders as per the procedure. It’s known as “Pra:chi:na vi:thi” and “Upavi:thi” when shifting the thread across sides. Even if someone doesn’t have the thread, custom is to use a cloth temporarily in lieu of this. The priest intended to perform the ritual, so he asked the man to tie his upper clothes around the waist. Then, the priest noticed there was no sacred thread on him! He asked – “Where is your Jandhyam (sacred thread)?”\nThe man was well aware that he is supposed to have it as per the custom. He is accustomed to wearing a neatly ironed thread temporarily for such traditional instances, but he arrived in a hurry and forgot to wear it this time. His false pride obstructed him from admitting that he had forgotten and accepting his ignorance for not always wearing it. A man’s stature, power, and money prohibit him from admitting ignorance, preventing him from bowing down. They make him headstrong, argumentative and build false pride in him. He even misguides others.\nWhen the priest inquired about his jandhyam, this man was unwilling to admit that he doesn’t wear it. It is not appropriate to say he removed it. He definitely did not want to say that he removed it out of ignorance. What to do now? He asked, “who are we doing this for?” The priest replied, “for your mother.” He responded, “Mothers are women, right? Women do not wear yajno:pavi:tha (sacred thread). How can I wear one if the ceremony is for a woman who does not wear yajno:pavi:tha? Therefore, I removed it.”\nUnfortunately, the priest was not highly competent, having learned bits here and there. People, like this man, prefer such priests as they can be easily convinced to perform anything wanted instead of what’s appropriate. Such a priest should not be called a puro:hitha (one wishing well for the community). He should be known as puro:ahitha (wishing ill for the community). This priest was not a well-learned one, and could be easily manipulated. Thus, he was convinced by the man’s argument and accepted the man not having his yajno:pavi:tha. Then, this man was even more encouraged and further said...\n“When anyone is doing such a ritual where the ceremony is for one who does not have yajno:pavi:tha… neither the one who is performing it, i.e. me, nor the one guiding it, i.e. you, should have it. So, remove yours too.” He, thus, had everyone remove their yajno:pavi:tha and completed the ceremony. This is a terrific example to see that an ignorant person will not only tread on an incorrect path but will also goad others astray.\nArjuna hence said...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nguru:na hathva:hi sre:yo: bho:kthum bhaiksham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is better not to kill them, right? He also wants Sri Krishna to accede to this.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna is only promoting his argument but is not listening to the advice given. On top of that, he says that “they are great people.” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmaha:nubha:va:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthey are all great\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhy? His guru spent all his energy to make him the best of the best archers in the world. When Dro:nacharya ran into [great archer] E:kalavya, intending to avoid any challenges in attaining his goal of making Arjuna the best, he purposely asked for his [E:kalavya’s] thumb. Such is his ‘greatness’. That is, Arjuna is only seeing his guru’s efforts to benefit him, but is unable to see his mistake of taking away another’s thumb. “Maha:nubha:va:n”, Dro:nacharya, is a guru in whom he [Arjuna] even ignored the blame of having erred, just to make him [Arjuna] victorious. \n“How can I kill such a guru? Even you know this Sri Krishna, don’t you? Your own guru, Sa:ndeepan, has only been a namesake teacher for you for a mere 64 days. For his sake, You ventured on an impossible task and accomplished it. But You ask me to fight against my own. Don’t You know this much? I may be endowed with riches, kingdom, after I kill the guru. It may be that the world will appreciate the victory. However, if I won’t fight and kill them, due to which I might not get kingdom and other riches... I can survive by begging for alms. The world will then appreciate me more for my generosity. Therefore you must guide me towards a better path, not just a good path. You must give me advice that is superior or supreme, not just a good one.”\nIt appears that Arjuna is thus questioning even Krishna’s guidance or why He would ask him to do it! Arjuna asked, “How can I wage a war against these people, even though you ask me to?” Let us carefully observe how his ignorance grows in varied ways. We do have such stages as well. We need to use Sri Krishna’s response as a lever for progress, if we desire to elevate ourselves. Let’s try to learn it. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), It is the responsibility of an ujji:vishu (one who desires to elevate himself) to undoubtedly follow any command of those great well-wishers who help to attain a:thma ujji:vana (self-realization). However, this is applicable only when a true well-wisher advises us. At times, some people appear like well-wishers, but in reality, they may cause us harm. We must be careful with such people. We also have the responsibility to recognize genuine well-wishers in our life. Therefore, Bhagava:n (the Lord) has given us the knowledge and ability to differentiate in identifying such people.\nDrona:cha:rya (Drona) and Bhi:shma:cha:rya (Bhishma) were Arjuna’s gurus from childhood. Arjuna grew up having completed an exile, i.e., 12 years of exile in the forest and 1 year incognito. After which, the Pa:ndavas (Pandavas) were no longer able to perceive their childhood gurus’ earlier stature. They are now serving under the criminal and unlawful Kauravas. They are associated with Kauravas now, employed by them and wishing well for them. They do not recognize the great people who are being suppressed by their crime and oppression. They are unable to motivate them to do the right thing. Therefore, they are not in that venerated guru stature anymore. \nBut for the Pa:ndavas, specifically the middle Pa:ndava, Arjuna, Sri Krishna is now his guru. Therefore, when Sri Krishna advises and commands Arjuna to do something, Arjuna must simply follow. Whatever is asked to be done must be actioned without hesitation or doubt. Because Sri Krishna is unselfish and He is not one to act for appreciation from others. However, Arjuna is doubting the advice given even by such a person, at the beginning of Bhagavad Gi:tha’s (Bhagavad Gita’s) 2nd chapter. In the 5th slo:ka (verse), he asks...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nguru:na Hathva: hi maha:nubha:va:n \nshreyo: bho:ktum bhaikshamapi:ha loke: \nhatva:rtha ka:ma:mstu guru:nihaiva\nbhunji:ya bhoga:n rudhira pradigdha:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHow can I consume their blood smeared food and survive?\n-----------------------------------------------\n‘The kingdom is ours, all the happiness is ours and we want these all for ourselves.’ This is what Bhi:shma and Dro:na must be thinking being associated with Kauravas. The question is not whether they desire such things. However, they stuck by Duryo:dhana (Duryodhana) who is here to wage war with a desire for such things. It means they support him, doesn’t it? They can also therefore be called Artha Ka:mulu (those who desire power and money). That means Dro:na and Bhi:shma are thinking, ‘We want artha (wealth) and we want ka:ma (pleasure). We want to enjoy happiness. We need the kingdom’s riches too’. \n“If they are thinking thus, then as a key student of theirs, I should provide what they desire.” “How can I not do that? Look at the traditions of our elders in history.” Once there was a great person called Upamanyu. He was educated in a gurukulam (school). He was able to pass his guru’s various tests. He followed his guru’s orders to the mark. Isn’t that why we remember him now? What was his guru’s order? His story is amazing to recollect. \nGuru commanded – ‘Take the cattle out to graze’. Daily, he [Upamanyu] used to beg for alms and offered everything he received to his guru. This means he offered everything received on that day’s begging to his guru. But the guru did not leave anything for the disciple, like he was supposed to. This is of course to check the intensity of the disciple’s focus and obedience towards their gurus. But when we hear about the test, it sounds very rough and tough. Everything he obtained by begging, he offered it to his guru and the guru didn’t give anything back. The disciple is supposed to offer everything and not seek any benefit from it. \nHe was sent regularly for cow herding and milking. A few days passed thus. He used to accomplish that chore. Surprisingly, the disciple looked normal. The guru asked, “You look hale and healthy. What have you been up to? How did you feed yourself?” Disciple responded, “Whatever the plants and herbs I get while the cows are grazing in the forest, I manage with those.” Guru said, “Isn’t it a sin? To consume food meant for the cows and birds?” “If you take theirs, what will they eat? What will they do? So don’t eat them.” The disciple agreed, but he was getting hungry. He needs to eat something. What did he do? He started drinking the cows’ milk. \nAfter a few days, the guru further asked, “Child! You look fit and healthy. What have you been eating?” Disciple [Upamanyu] said – “Swamy (Lord), I’ve been drinking milk given by the cows.” Guru responded, “Oh No, isn’t the cow’s milk meant for its calves? If we drink it, isn’t it a sin?” The disciple agreed. Later, he started drinking the leftover milk after the calves had their share. Guru then asked, “Hey, how come you still look good?” He said, “I’ve been drinking the milk left over by the calves.” Guru says, “No, No. The cows, knowing that you will drink their milk, are not feeding their calves fully and are even causing them discomfort. So do not drink it.” Disciple then stopped taking the milk. \nA few days later, Guru asked again, “Hey, how come you still look good?” “Swamy, during the calves feeding time... whatever excess milk dripped from the corners of their mouths and was about to be wasted on the earth… I am consuming that milk.” Guru said, “Because you are drinking that milk, the calves are intentionally letting it go. So don’t even drink that as well.” What will he do? He is not allowed to drink milk, not even that which is about to be wasted. He is not allowed to eat food, not supposed to take food that he got by begging alms. How is he supposed to survive and overcome his hunger? He then looked for food that was not meant for any cattle as he was roaming the forest. He sadly found Calotropis (Jilledu) plants and ate them. When they are plucked, a milky liquid oozes out of its flowers. They spilled into Upamanyu’s eyes causing him to lose his vision. \nAfter sunset, the cattle returned but this child was nowhere to be seen. The guru’s wife was already worried about this child who was enduring those difficult tests, but had remained silent until now due to hesitation. Today when he did not come back, she couldn’t hold back any further. She demanded from the guru, “What happened to the kid? Wherever he is, go get him!” The guru had to now set out in search of the child. Prior to the guru’s arrival, Ashwini: devatha:s (divine doctors) appeared near the child and said... “You have lost your eyesight. We can help restore it.” The child said, “It is not needed. Whatever needs to be done, my guru has to decide. I don’t need your help.” \nWe can understand the intensity of his devotion by his dependence only on his guru to receive any benefit. Because the disciple didn’t approve it, the devatha:s simply observed him. It became dark and the guru, holding a lamp, followed the cattle footsteps, he found the child moaning in a ditch where he had fallen. He called out “Upamanyu! Upamanyu!” and the child responded “Yes!”. Guru recognized him and pulled him up out of that ditch. Ashwini: devatha:s then directed the guru - “He did not take any help from us, even when we offered it to him. So you may grace him and offer him what is necessary.” Then the guru bestowed the required necessities and took care of him. This illustrates how diligently one must adhere to guru’s orders. \nSimilarly for Arjuna, “Dro:na is one of my gurus, yes? I must be under their control too [following their orders].” When they expressed desire for the kingdom and its pleasures, how can I… “hathva:… ”… “…. bhunji:ya….” kill them and take their pleasures away? Oh No! This is unfair. In history, there is a story of the great Koutsa. Great poets said, “koutsa prape:de varathanthu sishyaha.” Koutsa obtained his education from a guru’s for 14 years. We don’t know if he learned 14 vidyas (knowledge streams) or not, but he learned for 14 years. His guru was satisfied that he had completed his education well and told him to return home. \nThe kid wanted to offer Guru Dakshina (offering to the guru). The guru was unsure what to request. Despite repeated requests, the guru was not showing interest. The student insisted on offering something, so the guru said, “Son, get me gold that is as high as a man standing atop an elephant, with a hand stretched up high.” The guru exclaimed that in angst, but the kid took it literally, i.e., to the word. With an intent to fulfill his guru’s wish, he went to meet King Raghu. At that time, King Raghu was performing a Ya:gam (sacred ritual) termed Sarvasva Dakshina:tham (offering everything). As part of that, he was to donate all his possessions. Then everything would be returned back to him. The king had donated everything to everyone that was already present. Then this kid arrived to ask for gold from the king. \nAs soon as the king saw this kid, he welcomed him with a clay pot and clay plate along with water to wash his feet. When the kid saw this, he could infer what remained of the king’s wealth. What could he do then? He said “I don’t need anything.” The king insisted, “You came here with a desire. I must know.” The kid revealed his wish, “But I understand your state now, so I don’t need anything.” King Raghu declared, “It was said that when one approaches saying de:hi (please), pleading for something, but is sent back without fulfillment... and the seeker leaves disheartened… the life force of the ‘supposed donor’ also leaves along with the seeker. Therefore no need to worry. Please stay back tonight in our guest house. Tomorrow I’ll be able to consider your wish.” \nThat night, the king ordered his army chief to plan an immediate attack on Kube:ra (the god of wealth) and take all his wealth. Realizing the situation, Kube:ra willingly filled the entire king’s treasury with all the available riches [well beyond his original requirement]. King Raghu summoned Koutsa and said, “Son, Koutsa! Take the entire wealth I have and offer it to your guru.” Surprised, Koutsa responded, “Oh my! What do I do with all this? I will only take the amount of gold that was requested.” King said, “No way. All this came for your benefit, so you must take it all and use it!” As per history, Koutsa accepts it all and offers it to his guru. That’s not the primary topic here. \nArjuna said, “This individual Koutsa offered everything his guru wanted.” “But here I am taking away everything my guru desires such as riches, kingdom and their happiness…” “… artha ka:ma:n …” “… katham bhunji:ya …” “… hathva: bhunji:ya …” – I am even willing to kill them – The other great disciples did not care to fulfill their guru’s desires. How could I kill and snatch away my guru’s desires and happiness – artha ka:ma:n? Is it fitting for me? Old memories, and riches smeared with their blood, will not let us enjoy, live happily or experience royal wealth. We will see those blood smeared riches forever. Therefore, you should be advising us that it is not right to go into this war. Instead, hey Sri Krishna, you ask us to fight and kill our gurus!? “… hi … ” \nWhat I thought is right, isn’t it? Arjuna thus exhibited the epitome of ignorance, trying to support his intent, rebuking Sri Krishna, his well-wisher. He even tried to convince Him to admit that his chosen path was the right one. Furthermore, he is trying to prove logically that his path is better than the advice given in sloka 2.6. Let us try to learn this gradually as we move along. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), When one is covered in ignorance, he not only acts arrogant but also tries to force others to conform to what only he knows and likes. Despite being advised of good in many ways, he will not easily accept those suggestions. We see this even in Arjuna. He tries to prove his advisor guilty as well. We can clearly observe this state of Arjuna at the beginning of chapter 2, verse 6.\nArjuna asks Sri Krishna:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna chaitadvidmaḥa kataranno gari:yo yadva: jaye:ma yadi va: no: jaye:yuḥu /\nya:ne:va hatva: na jiji:viṣha:maha te: vasthita:ḥa pramukhe: dha:rtara:ṣhṭra:ḥa //\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWe do not know which is better for us: to fight and win or to fight and lose. Those standing before us are the sons of Dhritarashtra, and if we kill them, we cannot live.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis sloka (verse) reminds us of our guru, Sri Gopalacharya Swamy. He would say, “Why is he talking like a fool?” … ya:ne:va hatva: na jiji:viṣha:mah (upon killing whom I cannot further live). Why does he say, ‘I cannot live having killed these people’? Is this what he should be saying? He should instead be saying, ‘I cannot live without killing them!’\nBecause they [Kauravas] committed many atrocities against [Pandavas], insulted their women, fed them poison, burnt their home, stole their kingdom, and cheated them in many other ways. To not punish them, to encourage them, to keep them close means we are further encouraging their heinous acts. It further means that we are indulging in and encouraging their faults. Arjuna should have therefore said, “What’s wrong in killing such people?” However, he is dragging Sri Krishna into his realm of ignorance as well.\nWhen one says “How would we know?”, it implies that neither party knows. That is what Arjuna is saying here. na chaitadvidmaḥa (We do not know). Using a plural here means, ‘We are unable to comprehend this.’ Instead, he could have said, ‘I am unable to figure this out.’ He could have said “… aham na ve:dmi …” (I do not know). But he isn’t saying that. Instead, he is using the plural form “na chaitad vidmaḥa …” (We cannot understand this either).\n“What is the guarantee that we’ll win this?” “Isn’t it said that winning or losing a war is at God’s discretion?” “Who will win?” He doesn’t want to say “who will lose?” Instead, he said, “we will win or they will win.” Sometimes certain words are amusing to hear. In Ramayana, Sri Ramachandra’s sons are Kusa and Lava. In Uttara Ramayana, Lakshmana would extol the qualities of Sri Rama.\nBhavabhuti, a renowned playwright, authored a fascinating anecdote indeed. In the anecdote, a horse is released post ashwamedha yagya (horse sacrifice). A notice is attached to its face. “Whoever dares to capture this horse will have to face Sri Ramachandra’s army!” “Dares to capture?!” “Someone left a note questioning our ability, insulting us!” “What do they mean by ‘dare to capture!’” “Tie it up! Let’s see who will come to get it.” They tied it up in Valmiki Ashram. Kusa and Lava, both of them, didn’t know then that Sri Rama was their father, so they restrained the horse.\nSri Lakshmana’s son, who was protecting the horse, soon followed. Sri Lakshmana’s son: “O! Brahmacharis (celibate students), sons of rishis (sages), who do you think you are, to restrain Ramachandra’s horse?” Lava and Kusa had already memorized the Ramayana by then. Kids [Kusa & Lava]: “Who are you talking about?” “Why don’t you introduce yourself first?” “Are you here to save this horse?” “If you want us to release it, then you must fight us. Why do you speak about Elders?”\nvruddha:sthya na vicha:rani:ya charitha athishtanthuyum (There is no need to speak of Elders now). An adage goes ‘vruddha: na:ri pathivratha’ (all elders are naturally respected, no need to mention them here). If you are able to show your might, then we are ready to challenge you now. We will show our ability as well. The note on the horse’s face reads, ‘If anyone is capable of restraining it…! As if the world is devoid of any true warriors?! “Capable of restraining?!” We are ready to prove that we can hold it and stand up to any threat that might follow.\nLakshmana: “Oh no! Why do you speak like that and about whom? This is Sri Ramachandra’s horse!” Kids: “Why do you mention Sri Ramachandra when you should be speaking about yourself? We do not need to speak about elders.” Lakshmana: “Sri Rama is noble and righteous!” Kids: “Hmm! It’s probably not respectful to talk about Him now anyway.” Lakshmana: “Why?!” Kids: “Ramachandra is a brave warrior. A warrior should always step forward and not in any other way.” ‘Any other way’ implies? If it’s not forward, then it’s backward, right?! Not even the word ‘backward’. Forget stepping backward, the warrior should not even utter the word ‘backward’.\nWe’re not sure if it exists anymore, but folks in olden days followed a practice when initiating a task. They wouldn’t start counting with number 1, instead they start with ‘beram’ (a term used to avoid bad luck), then ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, ‘5’, ‘6’. Instead, the counting goes ‘beram, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6…’ ‘7’ should not be uttered! No no! That word should not be spoken [as it’s considered inauspicious]. They continue with ‘6.1’, then ‘8’ and so on. They don’t even like to use certain words. Similarly, Kusa and Lava said… thishtantuhum vardhathe: vruddha:sthe na vicha:rani:ya charitha (Why speak about elders?).\nLakshmana: “About Sri Rama?!” Kids: “It’s alright, we know all about Sri Rama already…” Lakshmana: “What do you know about Sri Rama?!” Kids: “Some time ago they chopped a sweet old lady’s, Surpanakha’s, nose and ears. Them?” They must not have enough strength to face a true warrior. They must have had the urge to use their strength on someone. So they chopped off an old lady’s nose and ears and claimed themselves as the greatest of warriors! sundhasri: nidhane: akunta yasasa..! (they truly achieved great glory [sarcastically]).\nEnough! Not only that, Surpanakha later sent her three brothers Khara, Dushana, Trishiras in sequence. Khara came in the end to fight the war. When all his weapons rendered useless, he suddenly lunged at Sri Rama with a weapon in his hand. Sri Rama was fighting alone! He instructed Sita and Lakshmana to observe from a faraway mountain top. He said, “Watch how I alone will counter these 14,000 warriors,” and He fought with them! He decimated them all in a short period. Finally, Khara came and surprised Sri Rama! Sri Rama then had to take a small step back in that instant.\nSage Valmiki fascinatingly wrote -\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\napa:sarpath prathipadam kinchith thvaritha vikramaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe took one step back and then stepped aside so he could dodge the sudden attack and save Himself.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe killed Khara later, but that’s not the topic here. Whether Sri Rama killed Khara or not is not the important question here. “This great person took a step back and that is not acceptable.” “This Ramachandra! your Ramachandra! the great Ramachandra!” “The great one who is worshipped across three worlds!” “But maybe he is an ‘elder’ and everything they do is permissible. So let’s keep that aside,” says Kusa in amusement. It means that he wouldn't even utter certain words. Arjuna belongs to the same category.\nTherefore he says, “Who can predict the results of war? Who controls that? Those are in Bhagavan’s (God’s) control. Isn’t it?” …yadva: jaye:ma yadi va: no: jaye:yuḥu … (Whether we win over them or they win over us?). Who can predict this? Can this be guaranteed or can this be believed? Despite all the effort and after waging war, there are no guarantees for a good result. It makes sense if the end result is fruitful after all the destruction. But there is no such guarantee in war.\nWe need to observe here that Arjuna stooped to a state where he was doubting Sri Krishna’s knowledge and decision. This sloka depicts that ignorance in humans, the sorrow caused out of it, and the arrogance as a result can destroy mankind in various ways. He says “…kataratno gari:yaha …” (I am unable to determine what is right). No! He said “We are unable to determine …” “Why? If we win, we will accrue the sin of killing a guru. Else if we lose, we will not be respected. Either way we will be blamed.” “If we do nothing, we can perhaps save face.”\nIt means that Arjuna doesn’t mind saying anything or tricking others to support his thinking. Therefore we need to understand how sinful sorrow is. We don’t know if we will win or if they will win. “…hatva: na jiji:viṣha:maha…” (How can we live after killing them?). For whose sake do we desire these? We don’t have a desire to live by killing them. We desire to live along with them without killing them. We want to enjoy the happiness along with them. How can you say that we should kill them, take their happiness, and then live?\nIn reality, to win or lose in a war is … avyavasthe hi drushyanthe:… (Can you question this, which was mentioned in shastra?). It means Arjuna is not in a state to follow Sri Krishna’s advice and is moving beyond this stage. In reality, in such situations earlier, Arjuna was the one who had advised others. It is said, “paro:pade:sa ve:la:ya:m sarve: vya:sa para:sara ha” (When giving advice, one speaks as if the sky's the limit - but when faced with adversity, he sobs uncontrollably). Arjuna’s state is similar.\nDuring his previous Uttara Gograhanam War, when Uttara Kumara retreated with fright from the battlefield, Arjuna cajoles him to return and convinces him to wage war. This same Arjuna then said “It’s a sin to retreat, to give up, to let enemies walk away. War must be waged.” Then, he is the one who advised the prince to kill. However, on facing this situation himself today, the perspective changed - he is ignoring the knowledge from shastras. He feels his opinion is paramount. As an elder, he feels he always does things right, but now claims ignorance.\nThis is what we need to observe now. For anyone to admit that they don’t know something is a fine trait. It’s said, “... svajna:na jna:nino: virala: ha …” (There is no greater virtue than one to recognize one’s ignorance). But it’s not happening with Arjuna. To cure one’s sickness with a good medicine for better health, one needs to realize first that one is sick. If they don’t realize this, how can we help? If they don’t accept they are at fault, what can we do?\nSri Krishna’s opinion is – “We should not gauge what sort of happiness we’ll experience or how. Primarily, understand your responsibility here.” “It is irrelevant now what one gains or loses. Duty is crucial here.” However, Arjuna is thinking about gain and loss. He wants to enjoy the materialistic riches with them. It is immaterial if he would enjoy his life with them or not. Sri Krishna says that it is important to know your responsibility. Arjuna’s focus is on the desire for happiness.\nThe essence of Sri Krishna’s teaching is to reflect on responsibility. One must carry through with whatever is needed with those at fault - be it a relative, a woman, a man, or an animal. It is the responsibility of a wise person. You must adhere to it. This is Sri Krishna’s advice. This is the essence of Sri Krishna’s guidance. Because Sri Krishna is mahanubhava (one with a good heart), He can certainly shape Arjuna accordingly. Bhagavad Gita chapter 2, verse 6 demonstrates how Arjuna is trying to express his current state and how Sri Krishna is educating him. Let’s focus on this as we move ahead. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "episode": 15,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In earlier days, eligible rulers and ruling authorities would abide by the law. Anyone committing a mistake must be punished impartially. Also, anyone performing a good deed must be appreciated impartially. It means one would recognize even an enemy’s good deed. Similarly, even if the person at fault is your son, then he would be punished. In our Ra:ma:yana Ithiha:sa (history), for the welfare of his people, a king named Anaranya had exiled his son for his mistakes. A myriad such examples can be observed. It means unlike today, those rulers would not condone mistakes of their relatives or kin. We need to observe this carefully. Anyone who commits mistakes must be punished. Arjuna forgets this. Kauravas committed sin. Anyone who fights alongside them, hence, shares their sin. They are supporting them by standing with them. Anyone who sides with those who committed sin must face consequences. It means he supports the committed sin. \nBhi:shma (grandfather) and Dro:na (teacher) were not on the Pa:ndavas’ side. They were nice people, however. What’s the use? Despite knowing what’s right, they did not choose the Pa:ndavas’ side. Despite knowing that Sri Krishna is dharma:thma (righteous soul), saintly, all-knowing, and that whatever guidance He gives is deemed as sa:sthra (scripture), they could not pull themselves away from the Kauravas to join the Pa:ndavas. Despite knowing that Sri Krishna chose the Pa:ndavas, they could not support them. So they deserve to share the sin. It implies that they support the mistakes committed. They would hence be eligible for a portion of the punishment received. Anyone who commits mistakes deserves to be punished.\nWhat does he mean by “…katharanno gari:yaha…”? At times, one may lose in war, and at times, one may win. It’s immaterial if one wins or loses. What’s important is have you fulfilled your duty properly or not? Some time ago, our country Bha:rath (India) waged a war with China. Regardless of our army’s strength, due to the capabilities of certain individuals, we lost the war and had to abdicate part of our land. However, because current rulers are capable, they were able to hold the attacker at bay, forcing them to stay within their limits. It’s not at all important whether one wins or loses. Whether we take the right action, leveraging strengths and recognizing duties, is important. We must realize this. Whether the culprit is a relative or a woman, they must be punished. \nEmperor Pruthu advocates the same in Sri:mad Bha:gavatam (scripture). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\n“O! Earth, you are making a mistake! You are apathetic to the woes of your children.”\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Therefore, there is nothing wrong in choosing to punish you,” says Emperor Pruthu.\n-----------------------------------------------\nEarth appears as a cow and responds, “O! king, I am able to share milk. I can feed various beings appropriately. For that, I need a calf (to initiate the milking). Thus, please provide me with one and ask for nourishment. Then, I will bestow accordingly.” Emperor Pruthu then made one from each of the species - humans, animals, wild animals, domestic animals, cattle, birds, worms, bugs, spirits, and beings such as kinnara (celestial beings), kimpurusha (mythical beings), pannaga (serpents) into a calf that can feed and sustain from this Earth itself. Sri:mad Bha:gavatam states this about Emperor Pruthu. Mother Earth is a woman, but punishing her when she erred is not a sin. King Pari:kshith also remembers the same when he forgets his responsibility. \nArjuna, being of the same clan, is expected to know this. As he is consumed by ignorance and arrogance, he is unable to grasp what he was saying or what he is supposed to be saying. He does not realize that punishing others is his duty now. He forgets that pardoning those at fault amounts to encouraging them further. Even if we don’t motivate others in their sinful acts, we’ll end up accruing some sin and will have to face consequences. Arjuna is forgetting that the approver deserves more punishment than the one who committed sin. There is nothing wrong about having doubts. However, when at crossroads, one must approach Elders. After seeking guidance, one has to listen and conduct accordingly - following exactly what Elders instructed. Doubts will be cleared.\nSri Krishna is not an ordinary man. He is impartial and does not act for personal benefit. He desires universal peace. Therefore, His advice is always meant for attaining such universal peace. Wind does not favor one over the other. Ether does not favor anyone either. Clouds do not favor anyone. Nor does Earth. If Bhagava:n’s (God's) creations such as these are not partial and behave as per their true nature at all times, then the one supporting these, Bhagava:n Himself, of whom these are pruthag bhu:thas (distinct entities), He is e:kor vishnum mahad bhu:tham (the Single Supreme Being). How can His advice be partial in any way? It won't be, right? Arjuna is well aware of Sri Krishna’s nature in this regard. However, what we see is the effect of Arjuna’s arrogance. That blocks everything. It will reject the Elders’ guidance as well. \nDespite knowing that Sri Krishna is the One who works towards universal peace and that He is impartial always, suhruda sarva bhu:ta:na:m (well-wisher of all beings) He mentioned this. “I am the suhruth (well-wisher) of all bhu:tas (beings). I do not favor anyone. I only say that which is beneficial to everyone. If you realize this and respond appropriately…” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\n“sa:nthi mruchchathi:”\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“only then, will you attain peace.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe alludes to this in Chapter 5. When a person of this stature is giving guidance, instead of listening, Arjuna speaks about his own whims. In reality, any advice given by Sri Krishna is progressive and is politically just. He continues - “Arjuna, even those who you call as your grandfather and guru have agreed that whatever I resolve will become a reality.” Bhi:shma has accepted the greatness of Sri Krishna, as has Dro:na. “We are discussing them [Bhi:shma and Dro:na]. They accepted Me but you do not seem to realize it.” Sri Krishna is saying to Arjuna that He thought Arjuna knew Him. \n“Tha:taka (in Ramayana) is a woman, but an evil woman. When the time came to kill her, I did so. Did you know this?” “Pu:thana – an evil woman who killed little children and discarded them. Did I hesitate to kill her?” “Did I spare them simply because they are women?” When A:njane:ya Swamy (Hanuma:n) entered Lanka, its chieftain guard, the female Lankini, faced Him. She did not heed His words and smacked Him in the back. Hanuma:n then got upset and punched her with His left fist. She felt dizzy and collapsed. He then said, “You deserved to be killed but I’m sparing you as you are a woman. Leave!” After gaining sense, she bowed and prayed – “O, great one! Today I feel enlightened. Your arrival spells doom for Ra:vana’s glory. \n“Defeat to ra:kshasas (demons) is imminent! It’s a fact that the path for Si:tha’s return is laid out. Victory to you! Go forth!” This indicates that Hanuma, the righteous one and the one who even Sri Ra:ma extolled as the scholar of all sa:stra:s (scriptures), behaved to an appropriate extent in this situation. Therefore, it is imperative to punish anyone that is at fault. Also, Va:li (a character from Ramayana) spoke harshly to Sri Ra:machandra (Lord Rama) after Ra:ma took cover and struck him down. “Hey Ra:ma! You tarnished your clan’s glory! I assumed you were righteous when I heard that you are the son of Dasaratha. However, I am disheartened and disappointed,” said Va:li. He said many other things as well. \nLater Ra:ma explained and then questioned, “Is it really incorrect to kill you?” After listening fully, Va:li said – “I made a mistake. I spoke in a state of sorrow filled with arrogance. Ignore that. Shower your grace on my son, Angada. Ask Sugri:va to take good care of him.” He mentioned this to Ra:ma and also to Sugri:va later. Prior to his final breath, Va:li himself accepted that it was fair for Ra:ma to kill him. Yet, there are ‘descendants’ of Va:li that exist today who argue unreasonably and do not accept this. Irrespective of who, anyone who commits a mistake deserves to be punished! \nTo show that even the king deserves punishment, Ra:ma sentenced Va:li. “Kamsa (a villain) is my uncle. Yet, when he erred, I punished him as I had the responsibility to do so.” After Sri Krishna kills Cha:nu:ra and Mushtika, he also kills his uncle, Kamsa. Unfortunately now, Sri Krishna has to justify these acts while conversing with Arjuna. He therefore says that whoever is at fault, regardless if relative or anyone close - we must not assess whether it will yield any gain or not... one should not care if they win or lose… one should only check if duty is being fulfilled by punishing others. \n“Suba:hu committed a mistake, so did Ma:ri:cha.” “They needed to be punished. So I punished them. I never hesitated.” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\n“na chaitadvidmaḥa kataranno gari:yo”\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Arjuna, It is therefore not correct to say this.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSecondly, “… ya:ne:va hathva: na jiji:viṣha:maha…” “It is also not right to say that you cannot live having punished them.” “Do your duty of punishing them appropriately without worrying about anything else.” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\n“…te: vasthita:ḥa pramukhe: dha:rtara:ṣhṭra:ḥa”\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Speaking of Dhritara:shtra’s relatives – “Dhrutara:shtra is a blind person.”\n-----------------------------------------------\n“They are in the shelter of this blind man. They are therefore correct in their ignorance. If you encourage them, then you are becoming blind (ignorant) like him. It does not fit you.” Having said this, Sri Krishna exhibits Hrishi:ke:sathvam (the quality of being the Lord of the senses) to this point. Meaning, He is preparing Arjuna’s mind to be receptive to His guidance. He slightly enhanced the effect of Hrishi:kesatvam, thus maximizing Arjuna’s sorrow. Without Arjuna’s awareness in slo:ka 7, Sri Krishna made Arjuna speak like a jigna:su (genuine seeker), a genuine seeker. Let’s move forward in observing this. Jai Srimannarayana!"

The antha:h karana pravruthi (inner mental activity) - moral compass - always advises us on our actions. However, we tend to follow some advice from the heart and ignore some. If we think the body will like it, we tend to follow it. Otherwise, we ignore it and try to comfort the body. \nIn general, one gives priority to bodily comforts over all else. In the case of food, we give more priority to what our tongue likes. Generally, people prefer tastier food over healthy food. These days we see several preparations made outside the home. We’re not sure how they’re made, who makes them, when they are made, and what changes they have gone through. However, our mentalities have become such that we desire foods that look good and taste good. Earlier, we were a bit more careful and consumed food only if it was healthy - we agreed to compromise on appearance. \nWe have lost this ability to judge based on the quality of the food, as we care for taste alone. Kids like any kind of sweets. A little older like junk foods. Much older ones like fries. We think it’s enough if the food tastes good for the tongue. How do such foods impact health? Outside food, that is preferred, directly leads to cancer. Doctors and health care practitioners warn us not to eat these kinds of food and become vulnerable to such diseases. However, we still see the same foods available. This shows that man has interest in materialistic things that please his senses and body more than what is good for his health. \nIn addition, man is enticed by external beauty rather than underlying essence. All the while when making these choices, the person’s heart forewarns him. It warns, ‘you are making a mistake, this is wrong, it is not healthy.’ Whether we pay heed to the heart or not is the issue. Approximately 95% of the time, we do not pay heed to the heart. Probably, 5% pay heed to the heart and reform themselves. \nManas (mind) is a wonderful instrument for a human alone. In the case of other creatures, they only eat whatever they should and as much as they should. They eat only as much as they need. A few exceptions exist that show some greed, like monkeys that hide food in their cheek pouches to consume later. However, most animals have proper knowledge regarding their health and heed their conscience of what and how much to eat. Mostly, they don’t save food for later. This is something that only a human being does. That is why man needs to be taught what is correct. Such lessons need not be taught to any animals. \nA man has a heart, and hence, it is very important that it is properly taken care of. Scriptures and experience tell us that it guides us [of good and bad]. At the beginning of Bhagavad Gita chapter 2, Arjuna feels sorrow. He felt sorrowful because he found himself at war with his own A:cha:rya (teacher), Dro:na:cha:rya, and grandfather, Bhi:shma. This is the sorrow that Arjuna is experiencing. He is feeling that this is wrong. However, he is standing prepared for war, even if he feels that it is not appropriate. \nBased on others’ teachings, he understands his duty [war], but he has ka:runya (compassion) in his heart. Arjuna realizes that there was some change in his situation. He has never experienced this before. In the past, he never spoke with such grief. From a state where he was qualified enough to help others out of their grief, Arjuna has degraded to a pitiable situation. He realizes that he is in such a state. His heart is not warning him about this unnecessary state. \nIn chapter 1, we learn that Arjuna was also arrogant in a certain way. However, if we seek guidance from a qualified person, he will correct us and position us in the appropriate direction. Dhruthara:shtra took the shelter of Sanjaya, who was not capable enough to change his conduct. Duryo:dhana took shelter of Dro:na:cha:rya, but Dro:na:cha:rya did not get the chance to change his conduct. Fortunately, Arjuna took shelter of Sri Krishna. He is the one transforming Arjuna. \nBecause Sri Krishna had this capability to transform, He is referred to as Hrushi:ke:sa (the Lord of the senses) by Vedavyasa. Hrushi:kas are senses. He is the i:sa (controller) of these senses. Whose senses? The senses of all beings! The controller is none other than God, Himself. That is how He made Arjuna capable and a means to give what’s essential to humanity. This was the purpose of Sri Krishna’s avatha:ra (incarnation). \nTherefore, even if Arjuna was not eligible, Sri Krishna somehow cultivated eligibility within him and used him for the intended purpose. This means that Sri Krishna’s plan is to carve the ‘means’ as well into a suitable state and then begin His work on His task. If one needs to cut something, an iron piece needs to be acquired, sharpened, and properly turned into a knife – and then used. That is, we procure the means and we also transform it into a useful state. Similarly, Sri Krishna decided on Arjuna to be His suitable means and was getting him ready. \nThat is why He brought Arjuna from a state of supreme arrogance to a sorrowful state. We learned what sorrow is. What is it? It’s analogous to taking rough sand, softening it, crushing it, liquifying it, and allowing it to flow to its intended destination. This is something we do to the soil. However, a human being is relatively ‘wise’ and more ‘capable’, correct? In addition, his heart is a much more powerful instrument. That is why, Sri Krishna used knowledge, teachings, and thoughts to bring about change. \nSri Krishna initially made Arjuna feel pity for the enemies. Because of this pity, the heart that was hard as stone began to soften and melt. Once the heart melted, it could be put into whatever direction necessary. If it doesn’t even melt, that’s a different question. In the case of Duryo:dhana, this was impossible, because his heart never melted. However, Arjuna was warm-hearted. His heart first had to be softened, made ready to flow (take a direction) and then be taught. \nSo, Sri Krishna brought Arjuna to such a state where his heart was ready to flow. He made his heart feel sorrow, feeling pity for all the warriors on his side and the enemy’s side, as he thought of having to fight with them. He directed all the sorrow to one direction. He made him focus the same pity, a:krosam (empathetic aggression) and compassion onto Bhi:shma and Dro:na alone, and intensified it. He made him wail at the situation, feeling extremely sad and miserable for having to hurt them. This needed to grow to an extent where he would seek shelter from his a:cha:rya, as that’s the intended destination. \nTo make it reach that destination, He had to first melt his heart so much that it could flow and reach its destination. Now, it has reached its final stage. At this instance, Arjuna himself realized that he had a miserable state he never experienced before, and he wondered why he was feeling so. He began explaining his state to Sri Krishna in the 7th verse as...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka:rpanya do:sho:pahatha svabha:vaha\npruccha:mi thva:m dharma sammu:dda che:tha:ha|\nyachchre:yas sya:n nischitham bru:hi thanme:\nsishyas the:ham sa:dhi ma:m thva:m prapannam||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Hey Sri Krishna, I am your student, your servant. I am surrendering to you. Please order (sa:dhi) me to do what is appropriate and good for me, what is deserving of me.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nAlas, he pleaded with him. Sri Krishna wanted Arjuna to be in this state of mind and that’s why He made him ‘see’ everything with a certain perception. Sri Krishna kindled that curiosity and interest to ask and seek out the right path. Sri Krishna can now begin speaking to satiate Arjuna’s thirst. He first had to know that Arjuna had keen interest to know. Now, through this sloka, Arjuna comes out with his interest. \nyachchre:yas sya:n nischitam\nwhatever You think is right for me, command me and make me do it\nArjuna has now declared his interest, is receptive and in a ready state for Sri Krishna. Arjuna used two wonderful words as he spoke. If we carefully observe those two words, we will know why Sri Krishna taught Arjuna the remaining 17 chapters. Let’s make an effort to understand further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "episode": 17,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), An able person creates and readies his own instruments. Sri Krishna is an amazing sculptor and He too is getting His instruments ready. His instruments are none other than humans, good humans. His instrument therefore can be created from mankind alone. So, He is tuning His desired instrument, Arjuna, to be the best means and tool. Arjuna was relatively better than the rest. Hence, Sri Krishna thought it was simple to begin tuning him.\nWithout experiencing sorrow, one will not acquire interest to know the truths of life, to attain the knowledge essential for the best state. Sri Krishna is therefore preparing for a ripened phase of sorrow in Arjuna. Firstly, He brought about a sorrowful state in a valorous soldier like Arjuna. Usually, when a person embarks on a task of his interest, he gets excited to take it up, without feeling sadness. A driver, when given a task to drive, does so with interest and willingness. He doesn’t feel sad as to why he is asked to drive.\nArjuna is a soldier of great strength and valor. He is a war hero. When such a person encounters a war situation, his bravery rises to the occasion without worry to fight. Such a person should now be made to worry, inciting sorrow, triggering him to pose a question. There is a rule in shastras (scriptures). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka:rpanya do:sho:pahatha svabha:vaha\npruccha:mi thva:m dharma sammu:dda che:tha:ha|\nyachchre:yas sya:n nischitham bru:hi thanme:\nsishyas the:ham sa:dhi ma:m thva:m prapannam||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"O Krishna, I am overwhelmed with the state of ka:rpanya (sorrow). I am asking you, my heart is confused about what is dharma (righteousness). Please tell me what is the best course of action for me, as I am your disciple and I surrender to you.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nBecause, someone asking for information indicates their interest to know about it. Only then, one’s heart will absorb it well. Only when a child says he is hungry, will he find taste in food. Otherwise, he would not know the taste or value of food consumed. If fed forcibly, he will be careless about the importance of food he consumes. That is why, you should at least evoke hunger in a person before feeding him, or wait until he is hungry.\nSri Krishna waited for 90 years to see this intrigue in a person. Since nobody displayed interest, He chose Arjuna as fit because he was relatively more capable than the rest. Intending to use him as a means by evoking necessary desire in him, He began to gradually use His hrusi:ke:sathva (ability of directing others’ senses) on Arjuna. We discussed earlier about hrusi:ke:sathva. It not only evoked interest in Arjuna and triggered him to ask Sri Krishna questions but also made sure that they both were not disturbed by anyone as Arjuna began to converse and seek clarifications.\nHe used the hrusi:ke:sathva ability to freeze all the living beings on the battlefield, enabling only Arjuna to ask questions. Sri Krishna responded to those questions. Nobody could hear, interfere in or fiddle with that. He created such a situation. Arjuna was realizing, to an extent, his state. He, therefore, questions what was happening to him.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka:rpanya do:sho:pahatha svabha:vaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"O Krishna, I am overwhelmed with the state of ka:rpanya (sorrow).\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nKa:rpanyam means a state of plight, a state that makes the other person feel sorry for us. The state is termed krupanatha (pity). Krupanatha is nothing but ka:rpanya. It is an unfortunate state. Ideally, one should never be in a state where others feel pity for one. If need be, one should be in a state to help somebody out of it, but not vice versa. Today, Arjuna had descended down to such a state. This state is called ka:rpanyam. This is a do:sha (flaw). Therefore, he says it himself.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka:rpanya do:sha apahatha svabha:vaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"O Krishna! For some reason my heart is completely filled with ka:rpanya (sorrow). This is not something I want or ask for.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nI don’t need this! Which is why… pruccha:mi thva:m (I’m asking you). What are you asking for? Why? dharma sammu:dda che:tha:ha (my heart is in a quandary, unclear of what dharma is). \nmu:da (that which cannot be perceived) and sammu:dam (totally and completely imperceivable). Dharma sammu:dda che:tha: (my heart has touched the depths of darkness in the matters of dharma). Has it really touched the depths of darkness? Not really... It is the state of dim light, just like the time of twilight. It has reached the state where the heart thinks of adharma (unrighteousness) as dharma (righteousness) and dharma as adharma. I lost the ability to perceive the difference between right and wrong. My manas (mind) is making wrong decisions now.\nAlthough he was naturally a person with great mental strength, that is not the case now. No matter how great a person is, when sedated, he behaves under its influence. There is a method used to force answers from a person asking various questions, ‘yes or no’, ‘this or that’ etc. The person is put in trance using a sedative drug or injection. One gets into a trance-like state due to consumption of liquor as well. The degrees of daze vary by the amount of consumption. Some sip for taste, some take a heavier dose, and others completely indulge in it. A person who is on a high dosage of liquor can talk philosophy. The one who had consumed liquor in medium amounts acts crazy, chiding people around him. So liquor works in different ways.\nThe same ability exists for ka:rpanyam (sorrow), anger, and other emotions that exist in people. When one’s manas is occupied with anger, he completely loses his discriminative ability for right and wrong. He does not know what he is doing. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkruddha: pa:pam na kurya:tkah: kruddho hanya:d guru:napi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"An enraged person will not care who he is angry with - it may be his own father, child, friend, or well-wisher.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nThat’s the nature of anger. Similarly, emotions are also like inebriants and most importantly sorrow and anger. When consumed by them, the heart loses its originality and acquires the state brought about by these intoxicants. That is why when Krupanatha, i.e., ka:rpanyam, has intoxicated his heart, he struggles internally. In this state, he is not able to decide between right and wrong, or good and bad. He could have quit like Uththara Kuma:ra, jumping out of the chariot during go:grahana (solar eclipse) time. However, he was a sensible man. So, he felt he should not quit because he is the one who started it.\nIf he starts fighting, he is concerned about killing gurus (teachers). He lost the ability to decide between right and wrong. This is the effect of ka:rpanya. dharma sammu:ddache:tha (Dharma is the duty to be performed). Now he is in a state of shirking his responsibilities. What is the undoing here? It is to stop fighting in the war. It is not right to stop waging the war. In fact, he has come to the battlefield to fight. However, he is feeling that it is probably wrong. Asking for pity is wrong in war, but he feels like asking anyway. He shouldn’t see the background, relation, or usefulness of a person he is fighting with. If the person is wrong, he should simply be punished. However, Arjuna’s heart is unwilling to carry through that now. \nThat is why... pruccha:mi thva:m (I have come to a state of asking you, Sri Krishna!) Only when we reach out to an able person, will it lead to rightful knowledge for sre:yas (good benefit). A decision taken without resorting to an expert or a person with subject knowledge may turn out well out of luck, but it will not be ideal. Hence, decisions taken after consulting subject experts are better than those taken independently on whims.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnai:sha: tharke:na mathi: ra:pane:ya\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"Must not decide by yourself.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\npro:ktha: anye:nyaiva sujna:na:ya pre:shta: (Yama Dharmaraja gives hitho:pade:sam, teaching righteous acts to a young boy named Nachike:thas). pro:ktha: anye:nyaiva (only through the teaching of able Elders). When it (the advice) reaches through them, it is beneficial, but that’s not the case with self-decisions. To make it reach that destination, He had to first melt his heart so much that it flows and reaches the goal. \nUsually, it is hard to catch our own mistakes. It is likely that many have experienced this. If we write a letter, we may make some errors. If we review it ourselves, they may go unnoticed by our eyes. As we type something, we may not notice errors. However, when reviewed by another, errors are noticed. Similarly, it is not possible to notice our own mistakes. So, it is always good to consult Elders. When they correct or advise, it becomes beneficial to us. \nThat is why he says... pruccha:mi thva:m (Hey Sri Krishna, I’m not asking any random person, but You, who has the ability and authority to judge right and wrong). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyachchre:yas sya:n nischitham bru:hi thanme:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"Don’t decide what is right for me in this instant. Show me the direction that was already decided upon by a number of people for a number of others who were in my state.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nPlease advise me that which is already decided to be the right thing. Don’t decide on anything new for me today. nischitham sre:yaha than me: bru:hi (Please bestow upon me whatever is already decided as good, not leaving any room for unclarity or confusion). Whatever is truly favorable to me. Because in war, winning and losing is God’s will. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\navyavasthe:drishyanthe ide: jaya: para:jayau:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"Even you cannot say if the war will result in a win for us.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nEven now, Arjuna is hoping that Sri Krishna might ask him to quit. Hence he says... nischitham than me: bru:hi (whatever is already decided as the right thing to do, guide that to me please). Why should I advise you? He says, ‘this is why…’ by stating his eligibility to Sri Krishna. It is important for any person to proclaim his eligibility before seeking advice from Elders. What should one proclaim? It should be the eligibility of the person. Let’s find out how Arjuna explains his eligibility in the next session. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 18,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), One should always be humble and obedient when approaching Elders. Our humility must be recognizable to them. We must also let them know that we have the eligibility to readily seek their guidance. This is an important trait of a progressive, or successful person. Arjuna is proclaiming the same to Sri Krishna at the beginning of chapter 2, saying thus…\nO Sri Krishna, I’m ready to listen to what you preach! How should one listen? As a disciple, one should believe in the other person as his guru. One should listen to him with utmost politeness and obedience because it is intended for his well-being. Therefore, we must convey that we are a disciple to our preacher. Arjuna expresses this to Sri Krishna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyachchre:yas sya:n nischitham bru:hi thanme:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nPlease advise me what is already decided as beneficial and appropriate for those who were in a similar state as me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nPlease instruct me! As I’m currently in a quandary, unable to decide what is right for me, please instruct me. Don’t decide anything now, but please consider what is already established as best and instruct accordingly. \nnischitham shre:yah (that which has already been decided) I am not in a state to find out what it is. As I’m disoriented in this gloom, please enlighten me with knowledge to relieve me from this gloom. Arjuna prayed to Sri Krishna saying…\nsishyas the:ham (I’m your disciple!) A disciple is somebody who follows the decree of his master. Was he a follower from the past? No! \nsakhe:thi mathva: (He believed Sri Krishna as his relative, brother-in-law.) Or he believed Sri Krishna to be a cowherd. He also believed Sri Krishna to be his close friend. The Pandavas’ feelings towards Sri Krishna were in several forms, including reverence and devotion. However, the Pandavas considered Sri Krishna being their brother-in-law as most important. Arjuna felt the same...\n“Because of this, I have been taking your word as a suggestion, not as a decree.” I did not consider it as an order of a master to his disciple. I may have not had this interest earlier, probably that is why you did not give me this directive earlier. But now, I have come to You as your sishya (disciple). As a master to a disciple, you have the power to command me.\nsa:dhi (instruct me) He goes further to say…\nsa:dhi ma:m thva:m (as I have taken refuge under you...) prapannam (I have become Your surrenderer) I’m not only a disciple but also a surrenderer. What does prapanna mean? ‘I know no one beyond You who can protect me.’ \nthvame:va upa:ya bhu:tho me: bha:vaha idi pra:rthana: mathihi (A prayer recited in sorrow, feeling there is no other way or person who can help other than Him.) I have this feeling in me now. In that way, I’m submitting to you and surrendering to you. As I have surrendered to you, in whatever way you drive me, I’m your possession.\nJust because a disciple is someone who lives under the tutelage of a teacher, until something is learned... They do not follow a master’s every word and live under his shadow throughout. They approach a teacher, learn from him, serve him and stay with him when they have some time. This was how a disciple behaved in bygone days. The disciple nowadays is a different person now.\nNowadays, the status of a disciple is such that the teacher is expected to rise up and greet him when he comes to meet the teacher. The teacher is expected to garland the disciple upon visiting. He is expected to be attentive to the student with folded arms… Because if he fails to please the student, he will not get his due rewards and reverence in return. Look at the businessmen, they have the practice to please customers. There is a system called PR, isn't it? With this PR, they live by a phenomenon called “customer is my God.” If you don't look after the customer, he will never return to you. As he has many hundreds of options to choose from. This is why a businessman has to look after his customer like God, serve him with due diligence, and attend to him - only then will business thrive. Hence, a businessman is advised by masters in this field to look after their customers.\nThe teachers too are travelling in the same boat as businessmen. If a teacher advises a student to reform his ways… the student may end up annoyed at the constant rebuking for whatever action. He may even want to get rid of the teacher and look for a better teacher who pleases him more. He may approach a person who is more pleasing, receptive, and agreeable to him. A customer chooses a place to get whatever product he wants. Similarly, a student too approaches a teacher, who pleases him the most. What must a teacher do now so the student doesn’t go elsewhere? He goes about being extra courteous to the student by greeting him, seating him and serving him with beverages like coffee and snacks. This is the kind of state the teacher has to go through. So the system is changing.\nSishya (disciple) is not expected to live with a master anymore. Even in the days of Upanishads, some disciples had a lengthy stay at a teacher’s abode. While others travelled to and fro, not staying for an extended period. This often worried students (who stayed longer) that they were not learning anything even after such a prolonged stay. They were worried that the students with shorter stays learned more than them. The Upanishads teach us that those worried students received their share gracefully by the same teacher or through other means eventually. That’s how a student is expected to be, that’s the law.\nNow I’m your disciple. I am not that kind of disciple who leaves the teacher once he acquires the required knowledge. \nsishyas the:ham sa:dhi ma:m thva:m prapannam (I’m a surrenderer to You) Arjuna reached the state of surrender and then sought advice. Therefore, Bhagavad Gita has become the great yo:go:pade:sam (the highest form of knowledge).\nBhagavad Gita is a yo:gam (yoga) and Arjuna is learning it from Sri Krishna. Arjuna lets Sri Krishna know that he is in a surrendered state (prapannam). Arjuna’s sorrow struck, breaking him down to a miserable state… transformed his arrogance filled state of ‘only I can..’, and questioning ‘who wins’ to… a state of complete servitude and surrender.\nthava da:so:ham (I’m your servant) It transformed and matured him to a state of da:so:ham.\nArjuna’s state transformed to such a ripened form. Sri Krishna, in order to preach what He wanted to, bestowed grace that brought about this transformation in Arjuna. As we discussed earlier, in order to teach somebody something new, one needs to create a situation so it is sought after. If the question doesn’t come naturally, one should create a situation so the other person asks for instruction - then advice can be shared. This is exactly what Sri Krishna is doing at the beginning of the 2nd chapter.\nWhat is He doing? We talked about the outline of Arjuna’s prayer…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka:rpanya do:sho:pahatha svabha:vaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI’m impounded by a miserable state worthy of pity. I have lost myself in this deplorable state.\n-----------------------------------------------\npruccha:mi thva:m dharma sammu:dda che:tha:ha| (I’m beseeching you for enlightenment as I cannot differentiate between good and evil.) \nyachchre:yas sya:n nischitham bru:hi thanme: (please enlighten me about what had already been decided as good by the Elders) \nsishyas the:ham sa:dhi ma:m thva:m prapannam|| (I am in a state that I will listen to You. I am Your disciple and have surrendered to You.) There is a rule in sa:stra (scripture) \nbru:yuhu: sishyasya, snigdhasya guravo: guhyamuttha:mam (If a disciple seeks it, an acharya (teacher) can certainly reveal inner knowledge…) However, it cannot be taught to every disciple who wishes for it. \nThen to whom? \nbruyuhu: sishyasya, snigdhasya (the disciple who has the most devotion…) \nguravaha guhyam utththamam bru:yuhu (must be taught good knowledge even if not asked for; such a rule exists) However, Sri Krishna prepared and taught Arjuna to ask questions and then preached… two important words! One is ka:rpanyam (pitiable state) and the other is sre:yas (well-being). \nWhat else is there? Veda na:dam uses these two words in Upanishads to demonstrate an extremely profound meaning. Ka:rpanyam means it is not the state of empathy as one expects. Krupanudu does not only mean a person worthy of sympathy. Who is considered worthy of sympathy? What is sre:yas (well-being) and what is considered sre:yas? Does sre:yas mean a consistent state of material well-being of food, servants, money, riches and comforts? It is important to know the actual essence of sre:yas. Therefore, Sri Krishna used His hrishi:ke:shathvam (ability to control one’s senses) and made Arjuna question about these two words. Arjuna uttered these two words. \nNow with a reason to explain to Arjuna about these two words, Sri Krishna embarks further. As these two words have been found mainly in Upanishads… let’s further deep-dive in finding out how and where they have been used. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Knowingly or unknowingly, a flame burns on touching. Regardless of whether it’s a little boy, an elderly person, a wise one, or a fool. Just as how a flame definitely burns irrespective of who you are, any work performed knowingly or unknowingly, if worthy, definitely shows its impact.\nTypically, offering logs into a holy fire altar results in ho:ma (sacred fire ritual) or yaaga (sacrifice), and the great reward of performing yaaga follows. However, throwing them elsewhere does not result in a pious yajna (sacred offering). Earlier, on Bhogi, the day before Sankra:nthi (harvest festival), people would gather a few logs, burn them, and gather around for warmth and respite from the cold.\nAlthough the act of offering oblations into the ho:ma kunda (fire pit) is physical, it becomes yajna when an intense feeling is added to it. It also reaps huge benefits for that person, having a divine impact. Think of a person running; although running for fitness, if he runs around or towards a temple, it will bring divine blessings upon him. They call this a:nushangika sukrutha (a good deed performed unintentionally).\nWe did something for ourselves and for our own purpose, but because it was a good deed, it led to a greater outcome. Sometimes, things we do unknowingly or knowingly can turn out to be beneficial to us. Likewise, in Bhagavad Gita chapter 2, Arjuna was grief-stricken and could not decide whether to wage war and kill his own family. Arjuna’s grief and desire to know what is right led him to take shelter of Sri Krishna.\nSri Krishna’s teachings to him became a yo:ga (spiritual practice) with which one can free himself from material bondage. Not everyone’s misery can become yo:ga. Not everyone’s sorrow can become yo:ga. However, Arjuna’s misery has become a yo:ga. Arjuna visha:da yo:ga (the yoga of Arjuna's sorrow) is the name of the first chapter of Bhagavad Gita.\nArjuna’s sorrow was slightly different; in the beginning of chapter 2, whether to fight with Drona and Bheeshma became a yo:ga. This yo:ga led to Sri Krishna preaching Bhagavad Gita and many yo:gas like Sa:nkhya yoga. Just like holding on to a branch or a rope during a free fall can save a person’s life, similarly, Arjuna knowingly or unknowingly uttered to Sri Krishna, \"shiṣhyaste: haṁ sya:dhi ma:ṁ tva:ṁ prapannam\" (I am your disciple; please instruct me).\nNo one can save me except for you - please tell me what is good for me? This question arising from misery became a yo:ga and made him eligible for something incredible. There are two words Arjuna used in that question. We will now try to understand them.\nIn response to a question of whether to fight or not, why did Sri Krishna preach hundreds of slokas (verses)? What was the need to preach to the point of exasperation from Arjuna? These are the questions that may arise within some of us. Sri Krishna could have simply instructed Arjuna what to do instead of preaching so much. This went on until Arjuna finally said, \"sthitho:smi gatha sandehaha\" (I am stable, my doubts are removed now).\nWhy did Krishna preach for so long? It is because Arjuna unknowingly uttered a few important words in his questions. That is why, with or without knowledge, we should speak good words. That is why, with or without knowledge, say some divine words. With or without knowledge, talk about holy places, their significance and importance. Unknowingly, this will lead to good outcomes.\nWhen you listen to mindless chatter from different types of social media and then apply it to life, things become chaotic and disoriented. Instead, learn something spiritual; it would be beneficial to chant during a rainy day. It is because of this that our elders taught us sthothra:s (hymns), which can be sung at any time of the day.\nBack in those days, our elders, until the last minute of their lives, remembered these hymns, poems, etc., which they learned in childhood and mumbled them at all times, while they were at any work, while bathing, getting dressed, or while getting ready. In those days, even in the villages, during leisure, people indulged themselves in practicing chanting of poems from Bha:gavatha (Bhagavata Purana) or Bha:ratha (Mahabharata).\nUnknowingly or fortuitously, these good deeds lead to a virtuous life and also add to our good karma. In this way, Arjuna unknowingly uttered two precious words in the 7th verse. What are they? \"ka:rpanya do:sho:pahatha svabha:va\" (I am overwhelmed by pity and confusion). This is the first important word. \nThe second one is \"yachchre:yas sya:n nischitham bru:hi thanme:\" (Please tell me what is good for me). What is good for me, or for a person who is in my situation? If it has been decided somewhere, please guide me. \"sre:yas of yacchre:yaha\" (the good).\nWe must know the inner essence of these two words [ka:rpanya and sre:yas]. Although we casually utter words like ka:rpanya, krupana (miser), and shreyas (good), they are not normal words. They hold utmost importance and usage in the Vedas. They were used in Upanishads.\nKar:panya is an amazing word. A person who has it is a krupana. There is a mention of this word in the Upanishad called Brihada:ranyaka. It appears in the dialogue between ya:gnavalkya maharshi (sage Yajnavalkya) and the king. Who is a krupana and who is a brahmana? The king asked these two questions.\nThe great Maharshi gave a wonderful reply to Ga:rgi, a female spiritual thinker who had immense knowledge of Vedas. Even though there were many sages and great people in the assembly, he replied to Ga:rgi as she asked him a question. There is a bit of history to this incident. The noble king, with interest and enthusiasm in spiritual topics, held such events where many learned scholars would come for discussions.\nThere were many debates and people were duly rewarded. They would take one topic and discuss it through questions and answers. In one such event, everyone was convinced that the sage ya:gnavalkya was the best among them as he answered all their questions. At that moment, Ga:rgi came forward and expressed her interest to ask him a question. The Maharshi duly agreed to answer her question.\nHowever, Ga:rgi put forward a condition. “If you answer me with prejudice that I’m just a woman and inferior to you, let your head be broken into a thousand pieces.” It was a direct warning from her that he needs to be careful while dealing with her. After this, the discussion went on. She asked him many questions. The great Ya:gnavalkya gave wonderful answers to all her questions.\nWho is a krupana? Who is a brahmana? asked Ga:rgi. To which great Yajnavalkya answered, \"yo: va: e:thad aksharam avi:dithva: ga:rgi asma:n lo:ka:th pri:thi sa kripanaha\" (One who leaves this world without realizing the eternal truth is a miser). \"yo: va: e:thad aksharam vi:dithva: asma:n lo:kath pri:thi sa bra:hmanaha\" (One who leaves this world after realizing the eternal truth is a wise person).\nOne who leaves this world after realizing akshara (eternal truth) is on sre:yo: marga (the right path). However, one who spends the entire time given to him on entertainment without realizing the akshara thatthva (truth) is a krupana. It is the krupana who truly deserves sympathy. Earlier, there was a discussion of what “akshara” means; we will discuss it later.\nWhoever understands Akshara Thaththva, undestroyable eternal truth, is a bra:hmana - whoever doesn’t is a krupana, says Ya:gnavalkya. It means there are only two things that one needs to learn. What are they? First, tha:tthvika sa:ksha:thka:ra (realization of eternal truths) with the help of prajna (wisdom). Second, not attaining tha:tthvika sa:ksha:thka:ra because of indulging in endless pleasures.\nIt is imperative for everyone to live their life fully to the end. At some point, everyone’s life has to end. As per current standards, one is expected to live a maximum of a hundred years. However, in ancient days, people lived a minimum of a thousand years. Some even crossed 50,000 or 60,000 years! How many years a person lived is not the question now. However long or short is one’s life, one needs to acquire that knowledge that will save him from rebirth.\nIf he leaves his body without knowing this, he will be caught again in the cycle of birth and death. He will be reborn as an animal or wild animal on land or water, or a bird, which can be a herbivore or a carnivore. Nobody knows what he will be reborn as; it could be a tree, stone, insect, or anything. Even after coming to an elevated stage, if he falls down again, there is no one more to be pitied than him - he is a krupana.\nThis is how Ya:gnavalkya Maharshi defines krupana in that assembly. Let us further delve into the word and progress. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Arjuna failed in upholding dharma (righteousness), thinking what he was doing was right. Duryodhana also failed to do the same by hating what was the right thing to do. Both of them knew what was right, but didn’t know the right method of implementing it. Duryodhana wasn’t the type who listens to others. But, Arjuna had the quality of listening to others and hence became a key person for us.\nIn the form of Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna had to clarify and explain sreyas (conductive to well-being) and the goal of human life. He felt we should be made aware of the importance of attaining the right knowledge. If we have the supreme knowledge, then we can judge for ourselves what is right or wrong and what our duty is. So Sri Krishna started preaching atma tattva jnana (science of self-realization) to Arjuna in Bhagavad Gita.\nBut if you start sharing your knowledge about something without being asked, it will not be appreciated. Did Arjuna ask Sri Krishna to teach him the science of realization? Actually, he didn’t ask it knowingly but did it unknowingly. Arjuna said two things, ‘I have a fault in me called karpanya (pitiable state). Tell me what is sreya (good) for me.’ These two words, karpanya and sreya, are really important. Normally we will think karpanya means ‘a pitiable state’, but that’s not correct!\nWhat is karpanya? One is krupana (one who is in a pitiable state) when he passes away not knowing what needs to be known despite being born as a human being. Let’s take the example of two animals (cows). They were taken to a field full of grass and given 5 minutes to eat as much as they could. One animal started eating as fast as it could. The other animal kept thinking the whole 5 minutes if it should eat or take it home and share it with others. What will happen next? They will both be taken home.\nWe conclude that at least the first animal ate as much as possible and the other one lost the opportunity given to it by just thinking. If someone says, “Do this little thing, you will get great benefit. Everyone is welcome to do it.” One who is interested in it, one who needs it and qualifies for it should make efforts for it and attain it. If you keep thinking, you lose the opportunity, and you may not be presented with it repeatedly as per your wish.\nHuman birth is very valuable. For who? For the indweller, the soul (atma) inside. In actuality, the body that we see on the surface only works because of the soul inside. The soul is known as atma. If it is inside, the body becomes useful to work for something, earn, or at least to enjoy the experiences. If the soul is not within, it [body] can’t be used for anything except cremation.\nIf the body is given as a means to use in accordance with the soul, should we live for the sake of the body or for the self inside? We need to contemplate this. If you know about atma and body and their characteristics, then you can decide what you should do. Atma is eternal, the body is temporary. Now, what should we work for? Should we spend all our energy on something temporary? If it is said that it takes the same amount of effort for the benefit of the longer-lasting entity, should we not spend the energy on the long-lasting benefit instead?\nIt is our duty to think about this. Normally a wise man would use it for whatever is long-lasting. Sri Krishna felt the need to explain what is temporary and what is permanent, as we are not always aware of it. Because normally we only see the external body and think it is the one enjoying the pleasures. But that’s not true! If that’s true then even after the soul is gone, if we put this body in a comfortable car or an air-conditioned room… or place a tasty meal in front of it, it should eat and experience them all. But, that’s not happening.\nThe body loses its identity without the soul. Once the soul leaves the body, it (gradually) starts stinking, deteriorates, and (finally) gets destroyed. Should we work for such a body which loses its identity without a soul and is only used as an instrument for the soul’s experiences? Or should we work for the soul which is permanent? If the recipient of the actions by the body is the soul, is it not better to learn about the qualities and nature of the soul and work for its benefit rather than for that of the body?\nWise men should contemplate this. We should not lose long-lasting benefits for temporary happiness. If needed, we can sacrifice temporary happiness for the sake of experiencing long-lasting benefits. Should we prefer something that tastes bitter when we put it in our mouth but gives energy and strength later? Or should we prefer something that’s tasty now but will take our life 5 minutes later? Which one is good for us? We need to think about this.\nSince atma (soul) is the one which is eternal, if we acquire the right knowledge about it then we can mold this body into a good instrument and make it work favorably for us. Hence Krishna wanted to give that knowledge. But Arjuna should ask for it, right? Krishna had to prepare Arjuna for asking about it. Arjuna was at least willing to listen and was partly qualified to know about the right knowledge. Duryodhana didn’t have that qualification, so Krishna tried to preach to Arjuna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsishyas te:ham sadhima:m thvam prapannam\nyachchhre:yas sya:n nischitham thanme: bru:hi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI am your disciple; please instruct me on what is beneficial for me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn Bhagavad Gita 2.7, Arjuna asked Krishna - ‘Please tell me that [which is good for me]’. Since it is not good to share knowledge without being asked, Krishna made Arjuna ask him. If you feed a person when he asks for it, food will taste delicious. Similarly, if you share knowledge when one asks for it, it then stays in his mind properly. When Arjuna unknowingly uttered the words, Krishna spoke as though he were replying to what Arjuna asked for.\nWhat did Arjuna say? First he said krupanaha. He said - Karpanya dosha (fault of pity) vahataha swabhavaha - ‘I have this fault called karpanya in me.’ We discussed what karpanya was before. There is no guarantee how long this instrument called body will live. No one can guarantee that. Sir Arthur Cotton built a bridge on Godavari river and said this bridge will definitely last for 100 years. Surprisingly it lasted much longer than 100 years and is still existing. He also built a bridge on Krishna river and said it will last for a specific number of years. It lasted that long and more.\nWhen few people give certain guarantees, they can be trusted. But nowadays when people build bridges, they are collapsing by the time of inauguration. There is no guarantee this body will definitely stay for a specific amount of time like 100 years. Priests usually bless someone by saying - ‘Shatha manam bhavathi shatha:yu purusha:ha - may you live for 100 years.’ But the minute the priest turns his back, that person might get a heart attack or corona and die. What happened to the blessing? Don’t know. Can anyone say for sure how long this body will live? No one can say.\nThat is why as long as we are alive, we should do whatever good needs to be done without wasting a second. But shouldn’t he first need to know what is good [for him]? Only then can he act on it. What is it that ‘good’ that needs to be known? Yajnavalkya Maharshi revealed it to Gargi in his teachings in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. There is one tattva (principle) which gave this body as an instrument to the soul and brought it here, that is called Akshara Tattva (imperishable principle).\nThis Akshara has Vaikunta (the eternal abode) as its home and is also called Narayana. The Maharshi explains further in the same Upanishad that this tattva is what supports the functioning of everything by indwelling in them. We don’t know about it. It resides as atma (soul) inside every object and has it as its body and makes it function. That is only one and it is called Narayana.\nDeva Eko Narayanaha\nIt exists in every object starting from earth till the individual soul. That is Akshara tattva - that which is eternal and cannot be destroyed. Once you realize this eternal tattva, it will also make you experience eternity if you take shelter of it. Whatever qualities it has, you will also get the same qualities. We always wish for permanence in everything - our fortune, ourselves, our experiences, and everything around us. Those who wish for permanence should pray to the tattva which gives permanence, Akshara Tattva.\nTherefore, from the time one enters this body and before one leaves it… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\netad aksharam aviditva: Gargi\nasman lokath preethi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf one does not realize this imperishable principle while in this body, he leaves this world losing a great opportunity.\n-----------------------------------------------\n…if he doesn’t realize this tattva and leaves his body losing a great opportunity - he is the one to be pitied - krupanaha. Whoever understands this tattva while in this body is called brahmanaha (one who knows the ultimate truth). He is the qualified one and can be called brahmavit (one who understands Brahman, the eternal truth). It doesn't matter in which caste, creed, community, or gender he is born. It could be a man or woman, animal or Brahmin, untouchable or anything at all.\nWhatever caste, creed, or gender body he takes birth in, if he understands the tattva, he becomes worshippable to us. Because they understand the tattva, we worship them as Alwars (saints). We take their shelter so they can help us understand it. Arjuna said, ‘I am Krupana, please tell me about the tattva’. Krishna was elated that He got an opportunity to tell him about Akshara tattva. He preached, as Bhagavad Gita, all about Akshara tattva. That is why, though Arjuna asked a simple question, Krishna gave him a very long answer.\nThere are a few reasons like this. Let’s try to get to know them. Jai Srimannarayana! Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Human life is very precious. Bhagava:n (God) provided this body with great tools that help us in learning good things. He gave us proper buddhi (wisdom), manas (mind), and indriyas (senses) - crafting a neat connection between the three. We must decide whether we want to sustain or spoil this connection. If we desire to make it better, then we are on the right track. However, if we forget and ignore or abuse them, we are most unfortunate and pathetic.\nThere are always people around to give us good messages. If only there is the intention of knowing good, then there are many tools that Bhagava:n has created for us to realize good. These channels are always open. We should be prepared to receive. It can come via children, Nature, aged people, or through our own life experiences. We should accept good from wherever it appears.\nba:la:dapi subha:shitam ame:dhya:dapi ka:nchanam\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nबालादपि शुभाशितं अमेध्यादपि कञ्चनम्\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEven if a gold ring falls in dirt, don't we keep it after cleaning it? \n-----------------------------------------------\nThat is, we must accept precious objects from anywhere. Likewise, we should accept precious teachings from anywhere, like Ve:das (source of all knowledge), pura:nas (sacred writings), and ithi:ha:sas (ancient history). Coordinating all these, the foremost a:cha:rya (teacher), Bhagavad Ramanujacharya Swami dedicated his life propagating these through practice.\nOne should not consider the caste of the person imparting good knowledge. Despite being of the lowest caste, if his teachings are good and experiential (learned through experience), one should accept them with humility and worship such a person. A:lwa:rs are the great saints who incarnated in southern India. A:lwa:r is one who dove deep into the most virtuous and the best well-wishing tha:thvic (philosophical) ocean and has emerged. Put in another way, the experienced people. These experienced people are called a:lwa:rs.\nThese a:lwa:rs were born into various castes like Brahmins, Kshathriyas, Vaishyas, Su:dras, Harijans, Girijans, and Mle:chhyas. Birth into a particular caste is not important; knowledge is important. A person is respected due to his knowledge, not by birth. This is the philosophy of Ra:ma:nuja:cha:rya. A:lwa:rs who propagated such good knowledge are treated equal to Bhagava:n in the temples. Our people recognized a:lwa:rs’ songs to be equivalent to Ve:das and worshiped them equally. \nIn fact, they worshipped these songs with higher precedence to the Ve:das because they are very pleasant, clean, and simple - like the flowing crystal clear water of a river, unlike the complexities in Ve:das. All the a:charya:s (teachers) and Elders before and after Ra:ma:nuja:charya worshipped a:lwa:rs. Knowledge is essential, not the body. The physical being who is delivering the message is not the key aspect; however, whether the message delivered by the person is apt or not is important.\nWhat kind of message should it be? A message that increases our soul consciousness instead of body consciousness is a good message. What kind of food is considered good? Food that is tasty but harmful - not tasty but nutritious and a long-term immunity booster? Now the whole world understood. What is it? Even if temporarily unpleasant but boosting our immunity and improving our longevity, we should welcome, accept, and respect it. Recently, the entire world learned this fact very well. We should apply this to all circumstances. We should apply this to knowledge as well.\nPeople who impart such knowledge are our well-wishers. Their teaching makes our life worthwhile. It will help us rightly utilize the small opportunity we have. It will shape us in a way that others may not feel sorry for us. It will transform our life from being a krupana (one who does not recognize their true self) to a bra:hmana (one who has obtained essential knowledge properly). Bra:hmana does not refer to a person born in a particular caste and has a thread around his shoulder. He is the brahmave:ttha, one who obtains all essential knowledge properly. He is known as a bra:hmana.\nbramha anathi ithi bra:hmanaha\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nब्रह्म अनन्ति इति ब्रह्मणः\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBrahman is an eternal truth. \n-----------------------------------------------\nBra:hmana is the one who accepts this eternal truth as vital to their existence, unlike the ones who only recite the whole day with the sacred thread around their necks. Also, birth into a particular family doesn't necessarily make a person bra:hmana. Whether the person has the required knowledge or not is the crucial thing. All our previous a:cha:ryas have taught this, and the pu:ranas have also clarified the same.\nThe saint Ya:jnyavalka has explained this in Bhruda:ranyaka Upanishad. He points out Krupana. Krupana is the one who does not recognize his true self, the aim of life, and duty in his limited life in this body. Everyone who enters this body has to leave it, just like a person traveling by vehicle must get off when reaching his destination. A person boarding the flight has to deboard at some point. A person traveling by train has to exit when reaching the destination. Time spent traveling is temporary, not permanent - the work at the destination is everlasting. The journey only takes one to a destination.\nLikewise, we should remember that this body is a tool or time-limit to reach our destination. Instead, we think that this body is permanent and tend to waste the little time we have. Such a person who does not utilize time in this body wisely is a Kru:pana. We should pity such a person since he missed out on an excellent opportunity. The subsequent birth of such a person may or may not help him realize the good things; hence, pity such a person's wasted life, explains Saint Ya:jnyavalka to a great lady named Ga:rgi.\nAt the beginning of the second chapter, Arjuna admits that he is a Kru:pana, unsure whether it’s by knowledge or ignorance – and pleads with Sri Krishna to eradicate it. Arjuna used such beautiful words, \nka:rpanya do:sho:pahatha svabha:vaha.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nकर्पण्य दोषोपहत स्वभावः\nSLOKA MEANING -\nArjuna knew that being a kru:pana was a weakness. \n-----------------------------------------------\nWe, too, need this realization. Some people think that this body and soul are the same, and self-identify with the bodies. They do not want to listen to anything further and work accordingly. We should, in fact, take pity on such people - but if the person does not want to learn, there is nothing we can do for him. The first step is to realize that such a state is flawed. Arjuna realized this. Hence, he said ka:rpanya do:sha, admitting that he is suffering from being a Ka:rpanya.\nSri Krishna sighed with relief, ready to help him. Arjuna seeks Sri Krishna's shelter to emerge from his state of ka:rpanya. Now that he expressed it, Sri Krishna is ready to help him to get out of this state. This is achieved through buddhi (intellect). When there is a defect or gap in understanding, it can only be fixed by cleansing the relevant knowledge. If the hand gets dirty, the dirt goes away only if you clean the hand - not the leg or anywhere else. Similarly, when there is a fault in knowledge, it can be rectified when knowledge is cleansed.\nCleansing of knowledge is achieved only through attaining the proper knowledge. i:shwara jna:na:th\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nईश्वर ज्ञानात्\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen related to Bhagava:n and thatthva (truth), one’s knowledge gets purified. \n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is parama:matha: (the greater than the greatest knowledge). All the sages accepted it. Unintentionally, Arjuna asked Sri Krishna to help purify/rectify his knowledge. Bhagava:n Sri Krishna grabbed this opportunity to explain Akshara-thatthva (the eternal truth). \nAkshara-thatthva is of two kinds. The ji:va (soul) is akshara, as is Bhagava:n. Prakruthi (nature) is also akshara, but this akshara exists eternally while changing continuously. The ji:va is akshara, which eternally exists with change only in knowledge. Bhagava:n is akshara, existing eternally without any change in his form or knowledge. All three are akshara thatthvas, but one must realize that there are three such thatthvas. One should know that prakruthi, ji:va, and Bhagava:n are different but are always together. Why are they together? This is the tough part!\nTo explain all three, it took even Sri Krishna a seventeen-chapter long scripture containing all the required knowledge, even with concise statements. However, He explained so clearly and simply that Arjuna could understand very quickly back then. Our Elders urged us to at least read the original scripture, hoping that we, too, would benefit like Arjuna. A word used unintentionally by Arjuna, Ka:rpanya, deeply rooted in Upanishad, provided Sri Krishna with an opportunity to teach the vast scripture. He revealed Bhagavad Gi:tha to Arjuna.\nArjuna inadvertently made another request, yachchre:yas sya:n nischitham -\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nयच्छ्रेयस्यां निश्चितम्\nSLOKA MEANING -\nExplain to me what was already decided as being beneficial. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna was delighted to have Arjuna on a proper path. ’Sre:yas’ is a profound word. Doesn't sre:yas mean that which is good and aids well-being? It usually means well-being, but kato:panishad wonderfully explains what that well-being really implies. Let's move forward in understanding this. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), If one uses good words as a common practice in life, they enable the speaker to respond positively, regardless of their level of understanding. They also provoke a positive reaction in listeners. Hence, we are advised from childhood not to listen to bad words, not to watch bad scenes, and not to do wrong deeds. Listen to good words, watch good scenes. Our elders taught us that we must always be listening to, speaking of, doing, and watching good things. Of course, we now refrain from heeding this kind of advice. This kind of good is termed sre:yas (the good path).\nThe word sre:yas is used in a very deep sense in the Upanishads as well. The Kato:panishad talks about the depth of this word. At the beginning of chapter 2 of Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna asks Sri Krishna what is sre:yas for him? Whether to fight the war or not, what is sre:yas? Usually, a person would advise either to fight the war or against it. However, Sri Krishna didn't do either. He responded with seventeen chapters of Bhagavad Gita. Can He give such an extensive response without being asked? Arjuna asked! Only then, Sri Krishna responded. When did Arjuna ask? Arjuna asked what is sre:yas for him. Sri Krishna was content with this word, sre:yas, and started explaining it to him.\nWhat is sre:yas? Doesn't it just mean good? It is not limited to meaning ‘good’. It has a deeper meaning. Once Nachiketas visited King Yama. King Yama started teaching him. That teaching is called Kato:panishad. In this Upanishad, King Yama educates Nachiketas that there are only two paths that the soul can take. What are those? One is the path of sre:yas (the good path), and the other is the path of pre:yas (the pleasurable path).\nIn teaching to Nachiketas, King Yama says that whoever wishes to travel in sre:yo-ma:rga (the path of the good) will flourish. One who wishes to travel in pre:yo-ma:rga (the path of the pleasurable) will move in circles and will come back to me as my guest, and I will take care of him. One who travels in sre:yo-ma:rga doesn't require anything from me and will progress upward from me. In explaining this, he [King Yama] says,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsre:yescha pre:yascha manushyame:thaha\nthou sampari:thya vivinakthi dhi:raha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe wise person carefully distinguishes between the good path and the pleasurable path.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDhi:raha (the wise), one who has good buddhi (intellect), will understand these two paths carefully. What will he do by understanding these two paths? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthouhi: sre:ya a:dada:nasya sa:dhu bhavathi\nhre:yate: arda:th pre:yo: avruni:the\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who accepts the good path will be recognized as a good person, while one who is drawn towards the pleasurable path spirals down from the purpose of human birth, moving further away.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhoever is dhe:raha (wise), with intellect, will accept the sre:yas. What is sre:yas? What is pre:yas? Sri Krishna explains sre:yas and pre:yas in Bhagavad Gita. He [Yama] gives a long and detailed description of what happens to a person on sre:yo-ma:rga and pre:yo-ma:rga. In Bhagavad Gita chapter 8, Sri Krishna describes the same thing with simple words because complicated words make it difficult to understand. He talks about a white path, a black path; a bright path, and a dark path. What path will we pick if we have to pick one? Will it be a bright path or a dark one? We’re not sure what might cross our path in the dark - there may be snakes, insects, monkeys, stones, mud, or other things.\nDo you know who would select to go down the path of the dark? Thieves and people with bad habits would desire to travel in the path of the dark. Whereas an intellectual one would like to travel in a bright, well-lit path. He would prefer to travel on a path that gives him happiness. Isn't it? That is why,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsuklakrushne gathi:hye:te: jagathaha sasvathi:mathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere is a white path and a black path. \n-----------------------------------------------\nOn what path would you like to travel? I want to travel on the white path. Good! If you want to travel on the white path, contemplate on that path daily. Think of that path daily. There is a beautiful description of the white path. It says, agnissuklaha (the path of light). Our previous acharyas (teachers) have described this white path…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\narchir dina pu:rva paksha shad udang ma:sa: abda va:tha amsumath\nglou vidyuth varune:ndra dha:thru mahithas\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe white path is suitable for all of us. It is enjoyable, comfortable, and pleasurable.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHence, traveling on the white path is sre:yas. The black path is of two kinds. One is pitch black; we can't see a thing in that darkness. Another one is completely filled with smoke, says Sri Krishna. The path filled with smoke is called dhu:ma:di-ma:rga (the smoky path). What happens when we travel on this path? We are now talking about the journey of souls from human birth. We are currently not discussing what happens to other creatures. We need to know about humans. For sure, we will have to leave this body one day or the other. That is decided, isn’t it? What happens after we leave it? Should we slide ‘down’ to be born as an insect, rock, or something else? Or should we be born as human beings enduring all the joys, sorrow, and difficulties that come with this life? Or do we need a temporary status, enjoy various pleasures, and then finally slip from that position? Which one is desirable?\nIf we follow the path of dhu:ma:di (the smoky path), then we will be circling anywhere from insect life to the temporary life form that gives lots of pleasure like in svarga (heaven). That's the range of this dhu:ma:di, smoky path. This soul will be going through these parameters, circling in various life forms within it. The soul keeps rotating in this cycle. This is one path. There is another branch of pre:yo-ma:rga (the pleasurable path). It is called ya:mya:di-ma:rga (the path of suffering). The person entering this path will endure various kinds of suffering. The Garuda Purana describes these various kinds of sufferings based on the karmas (actions) of the person. Many of us might know about this Purana, and it's worthwhile remembering it again.\nWhat happens when one travels on ya:mya:di margam [according to Garuda Purana]? What does one feel there? We do not know for sure how accurate these descriptions are, but let’s discuss. There is a vast temple named Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Angkor Wat is the most humongous temple of all the Vishnu temples in the world. It was built during the 11th and 12th centuries. Inspired by the teachings of Ramanujacharya, the ruling king at that time started the construction of this temple, and his son finished it. In the temple, on a massive wall of 400 feet, there's an amazing sculptural description of what happens when traveling in these two paths. The mid-portion of the wall portrays the consequences of traveling on dhu:ma:di ma:rga (the smoky path). It shows birth and rebirth, happiness and sorrow, various kinds of income and experiences. The bottom part of the wall portrays what happens to a soul when traveling on ya:mya:di ma:rga through sculptures.\nWhat happens on this path? We see a lot of professional chefs who are experts in cutting vegetables. They cut the vegetables quickly into slices, and they carve them into beautiful shapes. They are experts in slicing the vegetable in various ways, horizontally, vertically, spirally, or granularly. All this is cutting. Our soul on this path [ya:mya:di ma:rga] is given a body capable of going through these various slicings. That body gets pierced with needles at times. It gets burned at times, and it gets fried at times. The Angkor Wat temple shows all these sufferings carved on its wall. Won't the person die if he gets tortured so much? The kind of body the soul acquires on this path doesn't die from this torture, but he feels the pain. This is ya:mya:di ma:rga.\nThe paths are dhu:ma:di ma:rga (the smoky path) and ya:mya:di ma:rga (the path of suffering). Do you wish to have such torturous experiences? Or would you fall into the cycles of birth, death, and all the joys and sorrows that come in between birth and death? Both these paths fall under pre:yo: ma:rgam (the pleasurable path). The subdivisions of pre:yo: ma:rga are dhu:ma:di ma:rga and ya:mya:di ma:rga. Is it wise to desire these paths? If one desires to be on this path, then he can go down that route. If one is adamant about being on these paths, then he is beyond anyone's help. However, one determined that these paths are not for him and he wants to travel on a brighter path, jyo:thir gamaya thamaso: (lead us from darkness to light) then the path is archi: ma:rga (the white path).\nEven this path is depicted on the top of the wall at the Angkor Wat temple. On this path, there are personnel to receive you, wash your feet, sprinkle rose water on you, decorate you, fan you with ornate fans, sing your praises, give a tour of various galleries, and finally take you toward Bhagavan (the Lord) and ensure that you are comfortable there. It is fascinating that all this was sculpted on the wall in the 11th century with the influence of the great Ramanujacharya. There is a white path and a black path. Knowledge of the existence of these paths is what is required when we are here on earth. If you know of the existence of these paths, you will conduct yourself accordingly. With proper conduct, you will benefit accordingly. Acquiring knowledge is a crucial step. What is it you should learn? One should learn about sre:yas, the white path. Everyone wishes to live in bliss, eternal bliss.\nTo conclude, King Yama narrates to Nachiketas that one should always desire to walk on the white path, sre:yas. Whoever progresses on this sre:yas path will never cross paths with me. He will gain my respect as well. As for people traveling on pre:yo: ma:rga, I will be ready with all my personnel for them. Employment of my personnel flourishes in leaps and bounds because of such people. The word sre:yas originates from here. Unaware of all this, Arjuna asks Sri Krishna to tell what is sre:yas for him. Pleased with Arjuna, Sri Krishna gets ready to reveal all the knowledge required to travel on sre:yo ma:rga. We will examine in further episodes how Sri Krishna goes about this. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), today we explore the essence of knowledge and its significance in our lives. What is jna:na (knowledge)? To know something as a wall, the floor, a stick, a head, the sky, a human, or an animal is not true jna:na. Even ants, mosquitoes, animals, and trees possess a form of intelligence. For instance, if we obstruct a tree's growth, it will find a way around to reach the nourishing sunlight. This instinctive intelligence is not what we consider knowledge.\nWhen we think of humans as superior to other animals, we must recognize that humans should have both general intelligence, like other beings, and unique, specific knowledge. Only with this unique knowledge can one be considered a higher being. Some may question the need for teachings and additional knowledge, believing that living a life that neither hurts nor helps others is sufficient. However, can one truly live without causing any discomfort or loss to others? The answer is no. Every action we take has consequences.\nEven a tree, which does not intentionally harm anyone, provides shade, air, and purifies the atmosphere. It offers flowers, fruits, and leaves without reacting negatively when cut down. Should we then say that the life of a tree is better than ours? If the goal is to lead an ordinary life, trees do that too. However, if we aspire for a more evolved life, we must follow the rules and norms of higher beings and strive to stand apart from them.\nWe must utilize our 'big brain' wisely. Ordinary cognitive abilities exist in all creatures, and we should possess them too. We need to understand our body, environment, and atmosphere without destroying them. If our cognition is limited to these aspects, we are no different from animals. True knowledge goes beyond temporal understanding; it reveals the reality (tathva) within us that sustains life. \nAs Sage Para:shara states, ajna:nam athah anyado:ktham (ignorance is something else). Chemistry and the science of atoms, while studied extensively, do not constitute true jna:na. Such knowledge only elevates us to the level of animals. If we aim to climb the steps of knowledge, we must seek actual knowledge that leads us higher.\nElders have taught us how to utilize various aspects of life—our body, senses, mind, and wealth. The knowledge that guides us in these areas is true knowledge. The one who imparts this knowledge is our hithaka:nkshi (well-wisher) and sre:yah prada (bestower of well-being). Walking this path leads us to sre:yo ma:rga (righteous path), unlike other paths.\nThe Bhagavad Gita was given to teach us about sre:yas (the best). Arjuna, unknowingly, asks Sri Krishna, yachchre:yas ya:th nischitham bru:hi thanme: (what is the best for me?). As a disciple (prapanna), he takes refuge in Krishna. Sri Krishna was pleased with such a disciple and began to elaborate on sre:yas. Thus, the wondrous Bhagavad Gita came into being.\nWhat does it teach? It addresses knowledge related not only to the physical body but also to the senses (indriyas) and the mind (manas). Krishna begins by explaining three distinct aspects: the body, the indwelling soul (ji:va), and the Supreme Soul (Bhagava:n) that supports us. Understanding these three allows us to decide on a course of action, leading to desired outcomes and joy.\nAs the ji:va resides in the body, it operates through the senses. Krishna teaches how to control these senses (indriya-nigraham) and understand the mind. This spans six chapters of the Bhagavad Gita, where He discusses the body, senses, and mind, marking our progress halfway up the stairs of knowledge.\nFrom the 7th to the 12th chapters, Krishna describes Himself. Curious, Arjuna asks to see Krishna's magnificent form, and in the 11th chapter, Krishna reveals Himself. After witnessing this, Arjuna believes everything Krishna has taught him. In the 12th chapter, Krishna explains that understanding Him is not difficult and is accessible to everyone.\nTo strengthen Arjuna's belief, Krishna recapitulates everything from the 13th to the 18th chapters, providing a comprehensive overview. He emphasizes the importance of turning inward towards the Supreme Bhagava:n and away from the ever-changing prakruti (nature). \nSurrender (sarana:gathi) to Bhagava:n is essential. Krishna assures that once we surrender, He will relieve us from all obstacles (pa:pa:s) that hinder our progress. He takes responsibility for eliminating these obstacles, saying, \"I will take the responsibility of eliminating all your pa:pa:s.\"\nArjuna, in his surrender, declares, sa:dhi ma:m thva:m prapannam (I am surrendering to You). Prapanna means one who holds onto the other, and in this case, it refers to holding onto Krishna with the intellect (buddhi) and mind (manas). True holding is not physical but mental, as distance does not matter when one truly desires something.\nThus, we must do prapaththi (surrender) to Bhagava:n and a proper guru. Arjuna acknowledges his surrender, stating, \"I am Your disciple. Command me now.\" He uses the terms ka:panya and sre:yas, which Krishna employs to teach essential knowledge through Arjuna. This teaching is what we now know as the Bhagavad Gita. Chapter 2, verse 7 is crucial in this context, and we will continue our journey of learning from here.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a wonderful boon bestowed on mankind, giving direction to humans on the goal of life and teaching them the way of life. Taking humanity as the common principle, irrespective of ja:thi (community), kula (caste), de:sa (country), varna (creed), varga (class), etc., Bhagavad Gita is the divine panacea which has come to give whatever is required for mankind to reach the goal of life and to attain higher consciousness. The master physician who graced it to us is Sri Krishna Bhagavan.\nArjuna is only a means or an excuse for it. Taking him as an excuse, Sri Krishna gave this wonderful medicine to the entire mankind. This is like an amazing vaccine. But it doesn’t have any side effects. This is a good vaccine that is harmless. It is also a panacea. Coronavirus, for example, affects people differently based on country, region, or on whether one had been already infected once or more! Imagine how difficult it is to make a vaccine for such a virus. If the virus behaves in the same way, it is possible, but if it mutates in different ways, it is not possible for the same vaccine to counter all these mutations. \nHowever, Bhagavad Gita is such a vaccine which can counteract any type of ‘virus’ or its mutations or any kind of risks it may bring upon or any ‘bacteria’ or anything else! It is a wonderful medicine which not only contains the capacity to challenge and eliminate any kind of flaw in an individual but also empowers one who accepts it.\nIn the second chapter, Arjuna is expressing the sorrow he is experiencing and praying to Sri Krishna to eliminate it. Arjuna’s main intention is to get rid of his sorrow. He is not thinking about performing his duty. How will Arjuna’s sorrow be eliminated? Why is he feeling sad? He thinks his sorrow is due to the war or from killing relatives and gurus. Actually, he shouldn’t feel sad about that. He should feel sad that they are ignoring and turning away from their duty. If he thinks that way, then he will think about how to drive others to perform their duty. Then duty becomes paramount. But Arjuna is not realizing what his duty is. He is aware of his comforts, his gurus, and the comforts of the kingdom. He is imagining that the sorrow is the result of these. \nIn reality, he should not feel sorrow because of them. He feels it is important to eliminate such sorrow that is caused by the thought of losing these comforts. He also believes he is in a position to make this decision. The decision must be made by Sri Krishna, and He must instruct him to follow it. But Arjuna believes that he made the decision. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnahi prapasya:mi mama:panudya:th yachcho:kam …\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“I do not see any way to remove my sorrow.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna seems to say that – “Not just me, even You cannot guide any further here.” The letter “..hi..” emphasizes that. [As per Arjuna] “Even You would probably say that it’s better to withdraw from the war. Being a relative, [You might prefer for me to have] these physical comforts, royal riches, and its experiences. Instead of gaining these comforts by killing, it is better not to kill but leave others to their fate. Without putting in any effort, isn’t it better to live in a forest and beg for alms? I will then not have any sorrow and will not be blamed for killing my guru or relatives.”\nInstead of viewing it as a sin, he should treat it as a duty or fate to punish the sinners and restore the kingdom. Arjuna is only seeing this as his personal experiences and sorrow. Arjuna’s opinion is that killing relatives is a sin, the resulting kingdom is undesirable, and it’s better to beg for alms than to enjoy those riches. But as per Sri Krishna, anyone who is at fault must be treated like an enemy, and it’s the duty of a qualified person to punish him. The kingdom must be run by a qualified one and is not by an unworthy person. Even if the ruler is a relative, if at fault, he must be punished to purge the kingdom. \nSri Krishna opined thus on what Arjuna must do and is trying to convey the same. But Arjuna, despite committing to be Sri Krishna’s disciple, is acting like those disciples who try to teach their gurus! They say – “Hey Guru! Your instruction is probably good, but I feel right about what I said.” Not sure then why they feel the need to learn from a guru. Similarly, Arjuna said – \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnahi prapasya:mi mama apanudya:th …\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“I do not see any way out of my sorrow.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe so:kam (sorrow) I have “… yachcho:kam …” “I don’t see any way out of my so:kam. How can You see any other way?” Why should Arjuna say what He is supposedly seeing? If anything, Sri Krishna should say it how He sees it. What does this sorrow cause? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nuccho:shanam indriya:na:m…\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“It is drying up my senses entirely and causing me a lot of grief.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat are your thoughts? \n… ava:pya bhu:mow asapathna mruddham ra:jyam sura:na:m api cha a:dhipathyam “Should I wage the righteous war and enjoy the comforts after attaining heaven? Else should I kill my relatives, eliminate them and experience the blood-tainted royal pleasures? Should I choose tainted royal pleasures or heavenly comforts? I feel they both result in sorrow. I prefer the third option to live happily where I won’t fight in the war and don’t have to choose the other two. I feel this is a better option for me. Even You may not be able to suggest a better alternative?”\nIn a way, he is suggesting that Sri Krishna cannot offer another alternative. If a student proposes an argument with the teacher and asks, “Can you think of a better proposition than this? Isn’t this the best approach?” In a way, the student is indicating to the teacher that he is not keen on listening to other alternatives. Arjuna is commanding Sri Krishna this way. \nArjuna’s mind keeps thinking that the result of the war is to attain the kingdom. He forgets that the war is to crush the adharma (unjust practices). It is not certain if one wins the kingdom or not. It is not important who will survive post the war. It is important, however, whether he helped decimate the adharma or not. Will the doctor ever think that he is torturing the patient? The doctor tries to cure the disease effectively. If needed, he will cut open the body, inject into it, or stitch it up. He will do what is needed for the body to cure the disease. How can we question the doctor when he is surgically cutting the body or piercing it? \nTherefore, it is not appropriate to think about violence or non-violence at that time. Focusing on the health of the patient is paramount for a doctor. Therefore, one should not focus on the end result but on the duty-bound actions. One should act to fulfill one’s duty but not debate on or expect resultant gains. It is your duty to plant a tree and water it. Sow and help grow it. Protecting it is your duty and should be fulfilled. Wondering whether they would be able to eat the fruits once the tree bears them should not be their concern. You must fulfill your responsibility. Such [result-focused] thoughts occur due to ignorance.\nSri Krishna realized that Arjuna’s misguided perspective of focusing on results or kingdom or killing relatives is due to his ignorance. How did He know it? He knew because of Arjuna’s choice of words. It is advised that a patient is allowed to speak in depth initially. The doctor is then able to learn more about his disease, the severity, and why he is suffering from it. Once he knows the root cause, administering the medicine will become easy. An able doctor is able to thus figure out the main cause for the disease and treat it well. Initially, Sri Krishna let Arjuna vent. Through that, it became apparent that his mind and thoughts are clouded with ignorance. \nIgnorance can only be dispelled through right knowledge. Knowledge germinates by good advice. Arjuna is not in a state to realize this, but Sri Krishna can clearly see it. Our Elders have said that there exist several kinds of people. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nni:thi jnaha niyathi jnaha ve:da jna: api bhavanti sa:stra jna:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“There may be many who know right from wrong, some who can predict good fortune in others based on palmistry, and others who are well-versed in the Vedas and can interpret them thoroughly.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere may be many such people and are usually known as ‘ghana’ or ‘jhata’. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbrahma jna: api sulabha: ha \nSLOKA MEANING -\n“It may be easy to find one who can speak about brahma jnana (knowledge about the ultimate reality).”\n-----------------------------------------------\nHowever, there is a challenge here – \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsva ajna:na jna:ni ha virala: ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Those who can recognize where their ignorance lies are rare.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey are almost impossible to find! They may not even exist! Those that can diagnose their ailment properly will go to a doctor and get it cured. If they are unaware of their ailment or do not admit its existence or are not inclined to learn about it, then they cannot be helped. More than the quality of the medicine, it’s the degree of clarity in the patient about the disease in him. If he is unaware of the disease, he would ignore or discard any expensive or highly effective medicine. However, if he is truly conscious of it, then he will try to seek out and accept the cure wherever it might exist now or later. \nSimilarly, when one is conscious of their ignorance, they would seek out a jna:ni (learned one) and follow his counsel for an opportunity to better himself. Sri Krishna is able to make Arjuna realize the ignorance he is suffering from by letting him speak initially. Sri Krishna is therefore in a position to administer the ‘medicine’ to Arjuna now. He will begin that process now. Let us move ahead to learn how Sri Krishna is doing it. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), When we approach the learned or elders, we should convey our problems to them. We should show our sincere interest in following whatever they decide is the right solution to the problem. In fact, we shouldn’t tell them about our ‘decision’. We shouldn’t put pressure on them to implement what we decide is the solution to the problem. But, in today’s world, people are not generally of that kind. We make our own decisions. The mindset that ‘everyone has to agree to my decision and there can’t be a better solution than this’ is prevalent today. Such [mindset] existed since Arjuna’s time.\nWhen elders give advice, we must let them complete it, think how it is right and be ready to follow it. But instead, if we ask them for a solution and tell them our decision regarding it, why go to them, ask them, seek their guidance and waste their time? Arjuna expressed his sorrow to Sri Krishna. Then he should listen to what Sri Krishna says, right? Instead, he is proposing his own solution. This is surprising.\nIn the beginning of chapter 2, he said ‘I am your student…’ \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nE:ka:dasi Vratham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI am your disciple and am surrendering to You. Please tell me what I need to do.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is good. But what does he say immediately following this, i.e. in verse 2.8? He conveys his own 'decision' and says there is no other solution than what he is thinking.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnahi prapasya:mi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nno other solution than this\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhy did he express his sorrow to Sri Krishna when unwilling to take His instruction? Who knows, perhaps a sort of ignorance. Sanjaya is very surprised at this. In verse 2.9 he says, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\neva mukhtva hrushike:sa\nSLOKA MEANING -\nspeaking with Sri Krishna this way…\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna is forgetting who he is talking to. Sri Krishna is Hrishikesa (the One who can control everyone's senses). Who is talking? Someone who thinks, “I know everything, I can do everything.” That is Arjuna; he is called Gudakesa (one who has conquered sleep) here. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\neva mukhthva: hru:shi:kesam guda:ke:sa:ha paramthapaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe is Gudakesa, thinking no one can face him.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is named Gudakesa; how did he get this name? Some people say he has long hair, guda:kam (hair) means hair. Therefore he got the name! That’s not true. Amarako:sam says, nidra:lasye: guda:ka:sya:th (sleep and laziness are given the same name, Gudakam). Arjuna has conquered Gudakam, which means he conquered laziness and sleep. Those two don’t influence him. \nIt is not the same for us. If we delay sleep time, it controls us as ’Jet Lag’. We can’t even begin to explain the impact of laziness. But Arjuna is the great one who proved in many instances that he has conquered both. Hence he is named Gudakesa. One who has conquered something should just know he can do it but not feel proud about it. However, Arjuna became so proud that he felt Krishna, who can guide him in the right direction, also shouldn’t talk against his decision. Sanjaya is shocked with Arjuna’s behavior.\nThat is why Sanjaya says -\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:va mukthva:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nspeaking with Sri Krishna this way…\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat did Arjuna say? In the beginning, Arjuna said, “Sri Krishna, I am your disciple, I have surrendered to You… please tell me what is right for me and what is nischitham (that which has already been decided as the right thing to do).” But then he immediately says, ‘I don’t see any other option than stopping this war’. He is declaring his own decision. \nArjuna, Gudakesa is contradicting himself while talking to Krishna, Hrishikesa - Bhagavan. He is proud of being Gudakesa!\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna yo:thsya ithi govindam ukhthwa:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI will not wage war\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen he says he will not wage war, he is declining to perform his duty. We have to remember this. It is his duty to punish those committing offenses. Who is he talking to? To Govinda (the One who gives pleasure), one whose duty is to punish anyone who has made an offense. \nWe have to remember how he got the title Govinda. At one point in time, Indra’s attitude began to cross boundaries. It is not wrong of him to accept offerings. It is a custom to accept offerings from those who are under his shelter, but he did not do it with the right attitude. What's the right attitude? To offer it to the Lord, stating ‘Krishna:arpanam asthu’ (Let it be offered to Krishna). The same rule applies to Indra. For Brahma also, the same rule applies. The same applies to us or anyone else. \nBecause whatever is available to us on this earth is provided by God’s grace. Air, water, or prana (life force) - none of these are acquired with our own efforts. The same goes for food; it does not come out of the ground on our command. Even those who cultivate crops in soil need some support for it to happen. Support could be in the form of fertilizers or some other form. Only with magic would a sapling emerge from a seed without any support. That support is given by the Lord. Indra lost this perception on that day.\nIn Bhagavatam, we see that Nandagopa and his community performed Indraya:ga (an offering for Indra). Sri Krishna’s age was close to 5 years at that time. He asked, ‘What are you celebrating? Why are you cooking so many offerings, decorating, etc?’ Nandagopa said, ‘Indra is the one who gives us rain. So we offer for Indra every year.’ Is Indra the one giving them rain? It is actually He, Sri Krishna, Indra’s indweller who gives them rain. \nWhen Sri Krishna is personally present with them, is it right of them to put Him aside and offer it to Indra? When the officer is present there, is it correct to respect the one who works for him for a salary while ignoring the officer? Now the situation has become like that [in Bhagavatam]. Since Sri Krishna is the One enabling everything by indwelling in all, keeping Him aside… they [residents of Gokulam] are making huge arrangements to offer everything to Indra thinking of him as the giver of rain.\nSri Krishna wanted to teach them thattva (eternal truth). He started making an effort to make them understand. He said, ‘Father, it is not Indra who is giving rain. It is the clouds who are giving it; clouds are formed by the sun.’ ‘Air carries the clouds. And those carried clouds will rain somewhere. This hill is the one who stopped clouds from going elsewhere and made them shower rain here.’ ‘Since the hill stopped the clouds, you have rain, the grass grows and the cattle eat it. They give you milk and you prosper with it. All this is happening because of Govardhana Hill, why are you giving credit to the invisible Indra?’\n‘If you really have gratitude, you should have it towards this hill.’ ‘Clouds being formed because of the sun and they giving rain after being carried by air happens usually. But you are getting the rain because of this hill. It is stopping the clouds and making them rain here.’ ‘So whatever offerings you want to make, make it to the hill if you really have gratitude.’ The cowherd boys liked what Lord said and made offerings to the hill. \nIndra got angry and caused a hailstorm in their village (Nandagokulam). The cowherds became frightened. Sri Krishna consoled them, “Don’t worry, let's ask the same hill to whom we made the offerings to protect us.” He went to the hill and said, ‘Hey Govardhan, become an umbrella.’ He lifted it up [to rescue them from the hailstorm] and saved their lives. That’s when Indra regretted his mistake. He realized, ‘I got carried away by ignorance, caused by hunger.’ ‘I invoked a hailstorm and made Sri Krishna, my Lord, angry. What should I do now?’ He pleaded.\nOK, what more is required when one acquires the right knowledge? It is not important to punish someone; what is important is that one becomes knowledgeable. Punishment is given with the intention that it [enables retrospection and] enhances right knowledge. Since Indra got the right knowledge, Sri Krishna forgave him. Indra said, ‘No, since you did me a great favor, I will give you a title - Govinda.’ ‘You saved me, the knowledge in me, cows, cowherd boys and girls, hence you will be called Govinda.’\nSri Krishna reminded the cowherds about their forgotten duty. Their duty is to make offerings to Krishna thinking that it is Krishna everywhere - in the hill, in Indra himself, in clouds, and in objects. He helped them realize their offering must be made to Krishna. Hence, He became Govinda. He also became Govinda as He removed Indra’s ignorance and made him realize that whatever offerings he is accepting are to ultimately reach… the indweller Vaishwanara (Lord in the form of fire that digests food). Thus, there was a wonderful scenario that led Him to be called as Govinda.\nThat Govinda is in front of Arjuna and he is telling Him \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna yo:thsya ithi govindam ukhthwa:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou are suggesting war but I won’t do it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna is thinking, ‘I think it is better to survive by begging; I don't need to work hard.’ \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthu:shni:m bhabhu:va\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSo far, he was trying to understand through dialogue. Now he declared that he won’t wage war.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthu:shnu:m bhabhu:va\nSLOKA MEANING -\nnow, he is declaring he won’t wage war.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSanjaya is telling Dhritarashtra that it is very surprising. Dhritarashtra felt happy when he heard this; why? He is also afraid that if the war happens, he will lose all his people as Sri Krishna is on the opposite side and is capable of anything. If somehow Arjuna decides not to fight, his sons (Dhuryodhana and others) can get the kingdom back without any trouble. They can enjoy the kingdom for another 13, 14, or 15 years or their entire lifetime. This is what wicked Dhritarashtra felt. \nDhritarashtra might have felt happy thinking his sons will be victorious. He was about to say, ‘What else will Krishna say apart from what Arjuna said?’ But Sanjaya didn’t let him say that as he had to tell him what happened there. Dhuryodhana wanted to wage war; Arjuna has decided not to wage war. However, Sri Krishna is not the one to see and tolerate injustice; His incarnation was not for that purpose.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndharma samstha:pana:rtha:ya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe came to establish the righteous practices.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe took upon Himself the duty to ensure the activity of His people, the results, and the responsibilities reach the ultimate destination. Would He leave Arjuna even though he refuses to do his duty, declaring thu:shni:m bhabhu:va? Sanjaya said, ‘ha! surprising!’ Sri Krishna is commencing the revelation to convey to Arjuna what He wanted to and give him clarity about his duty.’ Sanjaya thus started expounding its preface to Dhritarashtra. Let's listen to how that continues. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We are learning Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2. Arjuna is in despair. He is feeling bad for having to kill relatives for the sake of regaining the kingdom. Arjuna is wondering with grief if it is right to kill gurus for enjoying the pleasures of royalty. Actually, they are not waging war for royal pleasures. Arjuna is not standing as an opponent to his grandfathers or father-like figures in the war just for the sake of the kingdom. Then why is he fighting? To fulfill his duty and uphold dharma (righteousness). However, Arjuna does not initially realize this. He thinks the result of war is to enjoy being a king.\nSri Krishna has to refute this by giving him appropriate advice. Sanjaya conveys this to Dhrutharashtra in the 10th sloka describing the situation.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntham uva:cha hrushi:ke:shaha prahasanniva bha:rathaha\nSenayo:r bhayor madhye: vishi:dantham: idam vacha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSri Krishna spoke to Arjuna, who was in a pitiful state, as if he were laughing, in the midst of both armies, saying these words.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna is in a grief-filled pitiful state, not in a mood to listen to anyone. He is in an egoistic state of mind, feeling whatever he is thinking is right. To such Arjuna, Sri Krishna tells… like a friend telling another friend… like a guru teaching a disciple… like a well-wisher advising the one who sought his shelter. It is Sri Krishna's greatness to enlighten in such a way. Sri Krishna took it as His duty to tell Arjuna what is correct in all the ways and methods possible. However, the different methods used in the process must not make it complicated for the listener to understand or give him a headache. It must be delivered in a way that is easy to understand and is interesting to the listener. Also, it should qualify the listener to collate different parts of the message together. That is why Sri Krishna divides knowledge of the thaththva (truth) into as many chapters, many yogas (paths) as necessary.\nArjuna is confused about his identity - is he a relative to them? A ruler? Is he a victim of unfair royal politics? Someone supposed to uphold dharma? Is he the one to control adharma (unrighteousness)? Who is he? He has no idea - is he the body or the indweller (soul)? His opponents - are they bodies or indwelling souls? He didn’t know anything about the thaththva called ‘I’. But he started talking about others. There is a Telugu aphorism - if someone cannot reach a slightly elevated object, how can he possibly reach heaven? Similarly, Arjuna was talking about others when he didn’t know anything about himself. That is why Sri Krishna felt pity for him.\nPrahasanniva bha:ratha - praha:sam (laughter) means laughing a lot, in a happy mood. Why would Sri Krishna laugh and talk while Arjuna is crying? As if being inimical to Arjuna? Our Elders said it was not so. We can understand that if we observe what happened later. Sri Krishna thought, “After so long, Arjuna has now given me the opportunity to do what I wanted to do in this avatara (incarnation).” Sri Krishna was pleased for that reason. The purpose of the Sri Krishna incarnation was to deliver Bhagavad Gita to the world. However, that necessity didn’t arise until now. Until now, no one had given him the opportunity to do so as everyone felt they knew it all. Only if someone declares he is ignorant, takes shelter, and asks for it, can He reveal it. Thus, He never had the chance to preach Bhagavad Gita until this point. Now, Arjuna is providing the opportunity, so Sri Krishna felt happy. Hence prahasanniva bha:ratha - Sri Krishna was delivering it to Arjuna very happily.\nOr as if consoling him for not knowing certain basics. Or prahasanniva also means like a friend talking to another friend cordially. There is no scope for harshness when friends converse. It is possible that there will be unknown terms, grammar, etc., when a Guru teaches a disciple. Even in the case of a great man talking to an ordinary man, such can be the case. When politicians discuss, they talk about thousands of crores which is hard to comprehend for a common man. A layman may not even know the number of zeros in a crore, and they speak of lakhs or millions of crores. However, when two friends talk, they speak in terms familiar to each other, in an easygoing and light-hearted manner. When two people who are very familiar with each other talk, the conversation would be very easy to understand without difficulty. In a similar way, Sri Krishna revealed to Arjuna the essence of Vedas (sacred texts), the supreme truth, in such a simple manner so that Arjuna could enjoy and experience the same.\nPrahasanniva bha:ratha - Sri Krishna is delivering to Arjuna in such a friendly manner with a smiling face. Who is delivering it? Hrushikesha (Lord of the senses). We should always remember this word in Bhagavad Gita. The most courageous Arjuna felt sad, and gradually, it turned into deep sorrow, making him take shelter of Sri Krishna. It didn’t happen because Arjuna strived for it. Hrushikesha - It was Sri Krishna who was orchestrating these changes in Arjuna’s mind so he could deliver Bhagavad Gita to us through Arjuna. We are Sri Krishna’s main targets. He wants all of us also to better ourselves. Who is He? Not just for Arjuna, the Upanishad told us who He was.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nke:ne:yshitham pathathi pre:shitham manaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWith whose support is the heart functioning?\n-----------------------------------------------\nFor all living beings who have manas (mind) and for all the beings whose indriyas (senses) have the ability to function. Senses exist and function in all human beings and animals. Senses function for insects also. Even for trees, the senses exist and work to the respective extent. We might have heard of the ‘Touch Me Not’ plant. If anyone touches it, all the leaves fold inwards. After some time, when it no longer senses danger, it unfolds all its leaves to their original state. That [response to touch] demonstrates that it has the knowledge of senses. That shows that the plant is able to sense touch.\nKe:ne:shitham - wherever intelligence, mind, and senses are involved, who is controlling them? This was the question posed by the disciple in an Upanishad. With whose inspiration are they working? The answer is also the same - ke:ne:shitham. Ke:na is a beautiful word in Sanskrit. It means “with whom?” Ke:na also means “with God.” Kaha is one of His names. Sri Vishnu Sahasra Nama is a collection of 1000 names of God.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:ko naiko saha vaha kaha kim yath thath padam anuthamam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe is one, yet many; who is that supreme being?\n-----------------------------------------------\nAll these are names. One word is kaha. What is the meaning of kaha? kanathi ithi kaha - He shines brilliantly, hence His name is Kaha. Kaha doesn’t mean who he is. Kaha also doesn’t mean something to be questioned here. Kaha kanathi, who can we declare as ‘shining’, or when? Only Him whose brightness does not get covered even when there is absolutely no chance to shine. When can we say someone has won over hunger? Not about someone who just stuffed his belly. We say that one has overcome hunger if he has not eaten much past his regular meal time despite being hungry. How can we say someone has won over sleep? Even without sleep for 3 days, if he doesn’t succumb to sleep. Not about someone who just woke up from slumber.\nSimilarly, what does it mean to be shining? Whose brilliance does not get blunted even with many obstructing forces around, He can be called as one who shines. There are certain gems, Indra Neela Mani, which also shine brilliantly even when kept in the dark. mali:ma se:shu vasannapi kanathi ithi kaha - whether in dirt, coal, or any other surface, someone who shines brilliantly without any obstruction is named Kaha. He is God. What are those places? All of these, including our bodies. The soul exists in this body but is not visible or shining. The same is true for animals. However, God resides in the body along with the soul, ensuring it gets a form and name. Thus God is named Kaha.\nKe:ne:shitham - inspired by that God, pathathi pre:shitham manaha - He is the one enabling the mind to recognize something. Indriyas (senses) can also recognize an object. Buddhi (intellect) also can understand something in a similar way. One who energizes and makes everything function is God. He is named Kaha or Hrushikesha, Arjuna is speaking in front of such a God.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntham uva:cha hrushi:ke:saha prahasanniva bha:ra:tha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSri Krishna spoke to Arjuna, who was in a pitiful state, as if he were laughing, in the midst of both armies, saying these words.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSanjaya is saying - “Dhrutharashtra, Arjuna is thinking of himself as Guda:ke:sa (conqueror of sleep), controller of senses, and has taken a decision as if it is final.” na yo:thse, deciding that he will not fight. However, Sri Krishna is Hrushikesha, controller of everyone’s senses. He will never let a mistake happen. Sri Krishna felt that at least Arjuna had realized his own ignorance and asked for advice. Thus, He decided to tell Arjuna what was good for him in as many ways as possible, and through him, He wanted to deliver the same to society. He did not tell Arjuna secretly. Like Ramanujacharya’s guru who gave mantra (sacred sound) to Ramanuja secretly. After listening to it, Ramanujacharya climbed on top of the temple and shared the mantra with one and all. Like that…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nse:nayo:r ubhayo:r madhye:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn between both armies\n-----------------------------------------------\nOn that day when the whole world gathered there, in the midst of everyone, with everyone watching, Sri Krishna spoke to Arjuna. Vishi:dantham (crying), Arjuna was in a pitiful state. In order to orient Arjuna towards his duty... idam vachaha (this message) that maho:pade:sham (great teaching), which was delivered by Sri Krishna is Bhagavad Gita. Let us also try to learn that great message, the absolute truth which Sri Krishna has begun to deliver in an easily comprehensible manner. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), for any scripture, there is pu:rva pi:tika (introduction) and uththara pi:tika (conclusion) - an introduction and ending. The main scripture is in between these two. Since Bhagavad Gita is a wonderful scripture, there is also upo:dhghatham (introduction). It has pu:rva pi:tika and uththara pi:tika. We need to know where the actual scripture or sa:sthra (scripture) starts.\nFrom sloka 2.2, Dhrutharashtra u:vacha (Dhrutharashtra said), to sloka 2.11 is pu:rva pi:tika or introduction. The sa:sthra concludes with sloka 18.66, sarva dharma:n parityajya (abandon all forms of religion). Uththara pi:tika is after sloka 18.66 to the end of the scripture. It is not considered part of the scripture.\nWe might have heard of Sri Vishnu Sahasra Nama (Thousand Names of Lord Vishnu). It starts with the sloka shukla:mbara dharm (the one who wears white garments). From there through Dhya:nam (meditation), kshi:rod:hanvath prade:se (in the place of the ocean of milk), is pu:rva pi:tika. The actual Sri Vishnu Sahasra Nama starts from ‘viswam vishnur vashatka:ro’ (the one who is the universe, Vishnu, and the one who is invoked). It ends with two slokas ‘shanka bru:nnandaki chakri’ (the one who holds the conch, the one who holds the discus) and ‘vanama:li’ (the one who wears a garland of forest flowers). Afterwards, Uththara Pi:ti:ka is from sloka ithi:dham ki:rthani::yasya onwards.\nThe significance of the scripture or the benefits you get by reading it, who should read it and when, all those rules are covered in that. Pu:rva pi:tika prepares the ground for the scripture. Bhagavad Gita also needs an introduction. For us to listen to something good, our manas (mind) should be aligned with it first. \nWhy should I listen to this? What will I get out of this? Is it necessary? Such questions usually arise in the mind. Initially, efforts should be made to arouse interest in the readers so they feel - “we should listen to this and understand.” Pu:rva Pi:tika comprises all those efforts. Once that interest is aroused, whatever is disclosed later will be established firmly in the reader's heart.\nCommon people generally don’t like to listen to discussions about de:va (God). When discussing money, position, jobs, powers, etc., they are interested and think spiritual topics are unnecessary. If a loved one suddenly passes away, then we get shocked. He was fine until yesterday. He was talking until now, how can this suddenly happen? What exactly happened inside? Whoever we thought as a person is right there but now, not talking? Why? What is the actual truth? All these thoughts occur at such a time - not before.\nBefore, even when someone discusses these topics, we don’t like to listen or think about it all. When one gets separated from their loved ones, then the heart becomes tender. The heart which was hard earlier begins to melt. At this time, only whatever needs to be told has to be told. That is why during the 11, 12, or 15 days after the soul leaves the body, in the days of Apra Karmas (post-death rituals), activities are done for the benefit of the soul. Our elders recite and explain Garuda Purana and Archiraadi Marga (the path of light).\nAll these discuss Ji:va (living being), his existence, qualities, and other details. What he acquires if he does good deeds and the state achieved on performing bad deeds, etc. Is this the first body for the soul? Where does he go after leaving the body? What type of body will he get? What will he experience in that body? All these are explained in detail.\nAt that time, we like to listen to spiritual topics as one begins to think “why did this happen, what will happen to me?” Recently, since the COVID pandemic, even if loved ones or relatives got the virus, people were afraid to go near or visit them. If by misfortune they were hospitalized and passed away, people were reluctant to take the body or perform final rites, not caring for the bodies of loved ones. \nNow the situation has improved, but in the beginning, it was very bad. It was shown that way in the media and people reacted similarly. Even for a relative’s body, most people said - “don’t bring the body home from the hospital, ask them to do whatever they want with the body.” Why? The fear of the virus which killed that person - “if I also get it, and lose my life, what will happen then?” Everyone started thinking at that time about ‘I, my body, my life, death, etc.’ Even those who were averse to thinking of such things started fearing for their lives. We are seeing this presently.\nThrough experience, we realize that this body will be left behind. Some mechanism from inside is making us walk, talk, work, and think. We don’t know about that mechanism, but know that it is the one making everything work from behind. When should we start thinking deeply about it? When such a situation arises. All these days, our mind was averse to thinking about these. However, since the mind is showing interest in spiritual topics, now is the time to teach them as the heart has started to melt.\nFor example, once wax melts, it transforms into proper form when sealed. Previously, our folks used to mail parcels called VPP (Value Payable Post). They would cover the goods with a cloth and melt some red lakka (lac), lacquer, to stamp it. Normally, if you put a stamp on lakka, it won’t stay as it is very hard. Our manas is also hard like lakka. But in some fearful, happy, or sad situation, or when experiencing great loss, our heart starts to melt.\nIf one carefully observes when it melts and places the proper seal at that time... The heart which melted will not stay that way. It will get hard again. Even the lakka becomes soft, when melted and put on the parcel, but it gets hard again. Even this heart, depending on the situation, becomes soft and then hard again. So we have to imprint the proper seal when it is malleable. How do we know what that proper seal is?\nOur Elders, rushis (sages), spoke about our body, soul, its activities, karmas (actions), and Va:sanas (impressions), the records which get accumulated with activities. Whatever we do, records get accumulated. Whatever we see, hear, or do creates a record. We all know about computers. Once we start it until we shut it off, all the work we do, and keys we press - tab, space, enter, delete, and others - will be recorded somewhere in the computer. If someone quickly does something, deletes it, and then even ‘empties the recycle bin’, it will be recorded somewhere.\nThere are a few departments that do investigations. If needed they can retrieve what you have deleted and look at it. We are discussing this to understand that just like computers, whatever we do will be recorded internally somewhere. Those records are called karmas. Based on these, the soul will reach some state and will go to some place. That place might be good, bad, favorable, or unfavorable. It might give us happiness, sadness, or some passive state. We are granted a human life, solely to understand this.\nHence, we need to examine such situations which cause the heart to soften and discuss soul and God. Some folks talk about Garuda Purana, others talk about other things. If they receive the grace of a proper guru, they will discuss the blissful state named Archiraadi Marga. This is necessary for a human being. The same goes for Sri Vishnu Sahasrana:ma or Bhagavad Gita.\nThe entire first chapter and 11 slokas of chapter 2 are an introduction for Bhagavad Gita. The actual Bhagavad Gita scripture starts after sloka 2.11 and concludes with sloka 18.66. Hence, that sloka is called the last sloka, or Charama Sloka (final verse). After Lord’s upade:sa (teaching) ends there, there are still a few slokas, but they are all uththara pi:tika, epilogue. Now, we have come to a point where the scripture actually starts. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a scripture that reduces the sorrow of grief-stricken Arjuna. When he is unsure of his duty, it guides him on the right course of action and commands him to do his duty. Sri Krishna gave an upadesa (teaching) to Arjuna on what he needs to know.\nArjuna is in despair and is not sure whether or not to wage war. If he wages this war, he needs to kill all his relatives. He has to oppose his gurus and fight with them, which is a terrible situation. Arjuna feels that it is not right to do so. Based on Sri Krishna’s upadesa, Arjuna felt he knew the right action to be taken, yet he felt that he can’t wage war. He understands what his duty is but is not truly convinced of it. This is termed a:pa:tha prathi:thi (superficial understanding) - one who understands superficially. We need to try to understand with clarity. We should aim to get yathhartha jna:na (genuine knowledge).\nWhoever gives such knowledge is called a jna:ni (wise person) or pandit (learned person). The term \"panda\" refers to someone with knowledge, and in North India, we see pandas. In places like Kashi, Haridwar, Ganga, Prayag, and Bhadri, pandas are those who instruct on what and how religious activities need to be done. They also help us with other necessities or arrangements. Why are they called pandas? They read shastras (scriptures) regarding the activities that need to be done, and they have the knowledge, or panda, about it.\nPeople in our part of the country call them panditha or pandit. They don’t discuss superficial matters; they have actual knowledge and have realized legitimate thathva (truth). They understand the complete supreme truth as it is. Such learned souls do not feel grief or sorrow. Such souls have clarity about their duty. Those without such knowledge get doubts and feel sorrowful. Arjuna is also experiencing deep sorrow. To get rid of that sorrow, knowledge is required.\nThat knowledge that removes all sorrows is revealed by bhu:ma vidhya (earthly knowledge) in the Chandogya Upanishad. A brief gist - once upon a time, there was a great person, Sanath Kuma:ra, who started a big university. He put out an ad: “All those interested can apply.” He received an application from a respected person who was eligible. So he called him for an interview. The person who came was none other than Na:rada.\nSanath Kuma:ra inquired about Na:rada’s qualifications - since it is a university, he must have some prerequisites? Na:rada began listing his qualifications: “Rug Veda, Bhagavo Dhyevi (I studied Rug Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharvana Veda, and Eka:yana Shastra, known as Pancha Ratha A:gamam).” Sanath Kuma:ra was shocked. He asked, “Did you come here to study, or to lecture others? You seem to be more qualified than I!” Na:rada replied, “No, I came here to study.”\nSanath Kuma:ra said, “But you seem more qualified than I am.” Na:rada responded, “Indeed, I studied the scriptures, but only to the extent of grasping the text. I was unable to realize the inner meanings.” He continued, “manthra vidhe:va:smi na:ham a:thma vith (I was able to learn all the letters of the mantra and their notation, without any fault, in the prescribed manner).” “Hence I know all the mantras properly. However, I am unable to understand the thathva (essential truth) behind it.”\nSanath Kuma:ra asked, “Why do you want to know it?” Na:rada replied, “To get rid of my ignorance.” He added, “na:ham a:thma vith (I was unable to understand a:thma, the self). So I came here wanting to learn it from you. Because to be free from our sorrows, we need a:thma thathva jna:na (knowledge about the self).” \ntharathi so:kam a:thma vith (Only those who have true knowledge of the soul are able to be free from sorrows). “Only they can experience bliss. I would like to learn that from you.” That is how Na:rada requested Sanath Kuma:ra to bestow a:thma thathva jna:na. With that in mind, Sanath Kuma:ra delivers an upadesa known as “bhu:ma vidya.”\nNow Arjuna is in a sorrowful state. To be freed from that sorrow, he needs to be taught a:thma thathva jna:na. Arjuna usually wouldn’t listen to an upadesa. So Sri Krishna kept waiting until Arjuna came to this pitiful state. “Arjuna, even you do not know what is going to take your sorrow away.” \nArjuna said in the 10th sloka:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyachho:kam uchho:shanam indri:yana:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\nMy senses are suffering due to sorrow. I do not know of any means to take this sorrow away.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna thought of two means. First, he considered becoming the lord of this whole world:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nava:pya bhu:mou asapathna vruddham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTo win over all his enemies, to have the whole world under his control, to enjoy royal pleasures as an emperor.\n-----------------------------------------------\nFor that to happen, he needs to wage war with his relatives and gurus. The second option:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nra:jyam sura:nam cha a:dhipathyam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nGo to heavenly realms and rule there.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna felt that neither of these would relieve him from sorrow. He needed something else, apart from the above two means, to get rid of his sorrows. If he properly understood a:thma thathva jna:na (actual knowledge of the self), only then would his sorrows and fears be gone. That is what was required. To get rid of sorrow, it is very important to acquire a:thma thathva jna:na.\nA:thma thathva jna:na is in reference to the body and soul. When referring to other objects, it is the actual knowledge about those objects. A good means to be free of sorrows is to understand anything clearly as it is. We need to realize this. Sri Krishna starts talking about this from verse 2.11.\n“Arjuna, you are crying unnecessarily for things which are not worth crying for. You do not understand that for which you are crying. You don’t realize that you shouldn’t speak like this.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nasou:chyan anva so:chasthvam\nprajna va:dhanscha bha:shase\ngathasu:n agathasu:nscha\nna:nu so:chanthi panditha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose who have true knowledge never cry for the dead or the living.\n-----------------------------------------------\nTemporarily, pandits may feel sad if they lose something or someone because of the relationship they have with them, or based on the nature of objects, etc. Sri Krishna used a beautiful word here: na anu so:chanthi (they never cry). If you constantly cry for something lost, wherever you are and whatever you are doing, it is known as anu so:cham.\nIf one keeps crying for what is not worth crying for, regardless of time or situation, it is not correct. If we lose something and are not able to recover it by any means, we need to console our manas (mind) and stop thinking about it. Once someone passes away, that same person does not return. If you constantly think of them in sorrow for days, months, and years on end, you are forgetting your responsibilities. You are not making proper use of your time.\nBecause of the affection, love, and the type of relationship you share with them, when you lose that person, anyone with a heart would surely feel sad, temporarily. That is a sign of having manas. However, with the right intelligence, one should stop lamenting when possible and continue with regular duties. Instead, if we cry continuously, that is ‘anu so:chitham’. This should be avoided.\nYou are speaking like prajna va:dhanscha bha:shase (someone who speaks as if he has true knowledge but is actually lacking it). Why did he become like that? Asou:chyan anva so:chasthvam (crying for something which is not worth crying for). You don’t have the knowledge of that for which you are crying. What is Arjuna crying for? There are only two things:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ngatha:su:n agatha:su:nscha na:nu so:chanthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNo one cries for the dead or the living.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna used two words very beautifully: gatha:su (something subject to life force leaving it) and agatha:su (something never subject to life force leaving it). No one cries for these two. What is always with life force and what can be separated from life force? One of these is not always with pra:na (life force) - gatha:su refers to the body. The other is always with pra:na - agatha:su refers to a:thma (soul). A:thma is that which never dies.\nWhy all this dravida pra:na:yama (revealing of concepts in a round-about fashion)? There is a secret to this. Isn’t it enough to just state “bodies and a:thmas?” No, it is not. Sri Krishna is making Arjuna understand these words. Why are bodies known as gatha:su and a:thmas known as agatha:su? We need to know this. Let’s dive into the scripture by trying to understand these words. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), God has given the wonderful ability of speech to mankind. Words that we speak should be meaningful. Scriptures help us understand which words are meaningful and how to use them. If we use suitable words in a meaningful way, in the right context and at the right moment, it will not only make us feel good, but will also help the listener understand clearly what we want to convey.\nIn Bhagavad Gita 2.11, while beginning the scripture, Sri Krishna used two words:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nasou:chyan anva so:chasthvam Prajna va:dhanscha bha:shase\ngathasu:n agathasu:nscha\nna:nu so:chanthi panditha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nyou are mourning for that which is not worthy of grief\nSpeaking like a learned man, yet crying for what is not worth crying for?\nIntelligent men never cry for gatha:su (inert objects) and agatha:su (living entities).\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat should we not cry for? Intelligent men never cry for gatha:su and agatha:su. What are gatha:su and agatha:su? The body is gatha:su as it is not always connected to pra:na (life force). It gets disassociated with pra:na after some time. We all know that sometimes pra:na is present in the body and sometimes it is not. When someone dies, we say pra:na has left the body. Until that time, we say pra:na is there. As long as pra:na is there, they keep the body at home. Pra:na gets associated with the body at some time and will also leave the body after some time. One which loses connection with pra:na is the body. Hence, the body is gatha:su. The soul never separates from pra:na; it is always living. Hence, it is agatha:su.\nWhat is pra:na? Does it mean pra:na is nothing but air? What is air? Air is one of the pancha bhu:thas (five elements). What are pancha bhu:thas? They are five tattvas (elements). Everything in this world, from the smallest to the largest, is made of pancha bhu:thas. \nWhat are these pancha bhu:thas? \npruthviyap tejo va:yur a:ka:sa\nearth - water - fire - air - space\nWhen they combine, they take some form. In this mixture, one element may be more and another one may be less. At one place, water may be predominant; at other places, earth, and in some other places, fire, etc. Based on the proportion of pancha bhu:thas, the names of the objects also vary.\nSome people have very dark skin. Once in an airport, we saw there were two rows of people who were really dark. They looked like figures! This is one type of combination. We have to remember that for this body to be formed, there are different proportions of pancha bhu:thas. This is one type of permutation. \nFew folks have medium skin tone like us. Our skin color is not too fair or dark or red; it is a medium color. There are pruthvi (earth), aapa (water), tejo (fire), va:yur (air), a:ka:sa (space) - different shades or tinges. In this, some are a little darker and some a little fairer. Some people are red, some fair, and some very fair in color. When they run, their faces become red like sweet potatoes. This is their natural physical characteristic.\nWhen that body was being formed, the change in the ratio of pancha bhu:thas - earth, water, fire, air, space - is responsible for this type of physical attribute. We see that trees are mostly green. However, the fruits and flowers on that tree are many different hues. We see different colors in tender leaves and dried leaves. They have many flavors and fragrances in them as well. The reason for this is the differences in the ratio of elements in them. Taste comes from water, fragrance comes from earth, and color comes from fire. Fire is also known as tejas. Any color we see is formed by different proportions of the fire element. \nWhatever the variation in taste - too sweet, too bitter, too spicy, too sour, too salty - is because of the water element. The change in smell is because of the different proportions of the earth element. In the combination of fire, earth, and water, there will be not hundreds or thousands, but lakhs (hundreds of thousands) of variations. Computers have only three base colors. With different proportions, they result in lakhs of shades. Similarly, the changes that occur due to the combination of pancha bhu:thas are unlimited and enormous. Everything has to be formed with a mixture of pancha bhu:thas. This is a significant point.\nWe observe this in nature. However, for these changes to happen, there needs to be some consciousness working behind it. For a sapling to emerge from a seed or for the leaves, flowers, and fruits to sprout from the plant, for any biological phenomenon, there needs to be some consciousness empowering it. This consciousness is because of the power of the soul behind it. The soul is the reason for change or growth in anything. Let's leave that aside for now.\nPancha bhu:thas which bring all these changes are called dravyas (materials). These five - pruthvi (earth), aapa (water), tejas (fire), va:yu (air), a:ka:sa (space) - are dravyas. Some people feel that since we can recognize only four, those are the only four dravyas. They don’t consider a:ka:sa (space) as a separate dravya. Wherever there is space, they feel it is a:ka:sa. However, scriptures consider it as a separate dravya. All these five are dravyas. Va:yu (air) is also one dravya, but is air pra:na (life force)? The learned scholars said that this is not the case. Pra:na is different; va:yu is different. Va:yu is one of the pancha bhu:thas. It is present everywhere. Is pra:na or life force emerging from anywhere? Wherever there is air, do we find consciousness? No, we can’t.\nWe can see consciousness in our bodies, plants, insects, etc. Once pra:na leaves the body, the body is still lying there. There is va:yu (air) in the dead body also. Though we say there is no pra:na in it, right? Pra:na is different; va:yu is different. Va:yu belongs to pancha bhu:thas. Consciousness is dependent on pra:na. Pancha bhu:thas don’t depend on pra:na. Earth doesn’t depend on pra:na; it simply exists. Water doesn’t depend on pra:na. Fire and air also don’t depend on pra:na. Pancha bhu:thas always exist. Pra:na is not needed for them to exist. Sometimes they exist together; sometimes they exist independently. When they exist together, it is termed sanga:tham (co-existence). This body is named pancha bhu:tha sanga:tham. A tree is called pancha bhu:tha sanga:tham. These five bhu:thas - whether they exist together or separately - do not depend on pra:na. \nVa:yu is also one of these bhu:thas which doesn’t depend on pra:na. Just like the other pancha bhu:thas, it simply exists. What does it do? It helps in creating different types of forms and helps in sensing touch. If we touch something, we can sense if it is soft, cold, or hard. Air is one of the dravyas which helps in sensing touch and creating different types of forms. However, air doesn’t give life. Air is everywhere, but does it give pra:na? If it could give pra:na wherever present, pra:na should be even in a dead body. Air doesn’t give life; pra:na gives life.\nThis whole world is made of pancha bhu:thas. If air gives pra:na, then no one should die. We can see it practically and can say from experience that this is not the case. All inert objects exist without depending on pra:na. Hence, they are called gatha:su. If pra:na comes into these inert objects somehow, then it will have consciousness and it will be living. Without pra:na, it is simply an inert object. Those inert objects that don’t depend on pra:na are termed gatha:su. \nTo let us know that so much is behind this, Sri Krishna says gatha:su and agatha:su. Based on these words, we will understand the thaththva (eternal truth). Pra:na is with ji:va (soul). It never leaves the soul. The soul may be traveling to different bodies but will always have pra:na. Hence, the soul is termed agatha:su. Gatha:su applies to all objects in nature, but Sri Krishna is bringing our attention to specific objects and calling them bodies. All inert objects can be called gatha:su, but in this context, Sri Krishna is particularly referring to bodies - including Bhishma, Drona, etc.\nacha:rya, pitaraha, putra, thadaiva cha pithamahaha\nArjuna referred to all of them as guru (teacher), father, sons, grandfather, etc. All these bodies are gatha:su, pancha bhu:tha sanga:thas. They are inert and don’t depend on pra:na. As pra:na is in them now, they are working now. Once pra:na exits, they will become inert. No one can stop pra:na from leaving. When the time comes, it happens automatically. Sri Krishna used bodies as specific examples of inert objects and referred to them as gatha:su. As this is a scripture, we need to understand a few things. So Sri Krishna began explaining these terms. Let’s continue forward!\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Some words that are used for general reference are narrowed down to denote a specific instance. This process is called ‘sa:ma:nya-vise:sha-nya:ya’ - applying a generic term to a specific instance. Whatever we see around us is called prapancha (the universe). \nWhat is prapancha? \nprakarshe:na panchyathe: (it expands in a visible way) \nHow is it expanding? With names and forms. The one that becomes visible by expanding with names and forms is called prapancha. Another definition: prakrushta:ha pancha yathra (where the five elements are together in the most apparent way). However, generally, it is defined as prakarshe:na panchyathe: (it expands and becomes visible). Everything around us is like that.\nSomething that expands visibly (pancha) as a face (a:nana or a:syam) is called pancha:nana (five-faced) or pancha:syam (five-faced). This is the name of a lion. It is called pancha:nanaha or pancha:syaha in Sanskrit. We must have heard of the name gaja:nana (elephant-faced). Someone whose a:nana (face) is like gaja (elephant). \nSimilarly, pancha:nana means someone whose a:nana (face) is spread out. One would think then that Pancha:nana would mean someone who has pancha (five) a:nana (faces). But it doesn’t mean that. Pancha doesn’t mean five in this context. Pancha:nana means someone whose a:nana (face) is spread out. \nPancha:syamu also means someone whose a:syamu (face) is spread out. Even we have a face that extends from one side to the other. But it is not used to denote our faces. The word pancha:nana is only used for lions, as the lion’s face is relatively very big because of the effect of its mouth, face, and mane. Compared to its body, its face is very big. Hence, a face that is expansive applies to a lion.\nThere is something called sharabham or shalahbham which is also like that. Even though every face can be called pancha:nana, it is brought to something vise:sha (specific) and secured there to apply specifically to lions. Similarly, though gatha:su (bodies) and agatha:su (souls) words apply to everything in this world in general as everything is made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements), Sri Krishna is using it to refer to something specific, bodies.\nEspecially, He named those as gatha:su (bodies) that were once connected to pra:na (life force) and are now losing it. They are bodies. Everyone knows that a body can act until pra:na (life force) is in it. That body loses its ability to act when pra:na leaves it. But pra:na doesn’t leave alone; it is attached to atma (soul). It stays with the soul inside and leaves the body along with the soul. \nThat’s why no one says atma (soul) is gone; they just say pra:na has left the body. That’s why these bodies which are made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements) and have had a connection with pra:na once and lost it later are called gatha (lost connection) + asu (with pra:na), gatha:su. This pra:na which is currently within will definitely go out however and wherever you are. So intelligent men do not cry for that. Intelligent folks know that thaththva (eternal truth). Hence they do not feel dejected for those [bodies].\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npanditha:ha na:nu so:chanthi: gatha:su:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIntelligent folks do not cry for those bodies that have lost connection.\n-----------------------------------------------\nOne may wonder why Krishna used such complicated words instead of bodies? Since the purpose is to reveal the thaththva (eternal truth) behind these words, Sri Krishna has graciously used these words. Once the body stops moving, we declare someone as dead. The one responsible for the movement is the supporting connection with pra:na.\nBut we don’t know what has actually left the body as we can’t see atma (soul) or pra:na (life force). Even if we arrange a lot of equipment to capture its departure [from the body], we still can’t see it. We don’t know what has left the body and what is left behind. What is left behind is the mixture of pancha bhu:thas (five elements) [body]. \nIt's always like this. Air [in the body] blends with air [in nature], water blends with water, and earth blends with earth, space blends with space [once pra:na leaves the body]. Pancha bhu:thas come together at times and later separate from each other. Just because you keep them together, pra:na does not come into the body. Even in a dead body, pancha bhu:thas are together. Even if you pump air into it, it will not regain earlier movement. \nHence Sri Krishna clarified that they should be called gatha:su (bodies that have lost connection). What left the body? Whatever made all the parts react/respond and gave life/energy with its presence, that [entity] has left the body. That is called pra:ni (life) or ji:va (soul). He gave life to the body with his presence. He gave pra:nanam (the mechanism to breathe) to the body. \nJi:va (soul) took pra:na (life force), the one which is responsible for this pra:nanam (breathing), and left the body. Ji:va always has the power of pra:nana with him. Ji:va (soul) is always with pra:na (life force). He comes with pra:na and leaves with pra:na. Since he is always with pra:na and never leaves the pra:na, he is called agatha (never loses connection) asu (with pra:na), agatha:su. \nJi:va (soul) never lets pra:na shakthi (life force) separate from him. Since he eternally exists, why should we be sad about him? Pra:nanam (breathing) doesn’t always stay with pancha bhu:thas (five elements). However, pancha bhu:thas always exist, so why be sad about them? This is what we have to realize. Intelligent folks, therefore, do not cry over agatha:su (souls) and gatha:su (bodies).\nThen, why was pra:na (life force) or atma (soul) in the body till now? Because he has to experience a few things [karma] while in the body. That [karma] will not be the same for everyone. Its [karma’s] existence in this [body] makes him work. Whatever is the cause for making him do the work is called karma. It is named karma because it's making him do the karma. \nThe tool [body] is made for [experiencing] a certain portion of karma. Once that is done, he will take the pra:na (life force) and leave it [body]. Where he goes is a different question. Whether he goes into a different body or to parama:thma (supreme soul), he can go anywhere. As long as he is roaming around in the prakruthi mandala (universe), ji:va (soul) keeps pra:na shakthi (life force) with him always; he never gets separated from it. Hence ji:va (soul) is agatha:su (never loses connection).\nIntelligent folks don’t cry about agatha:su (souls) as pra:na never leaves him. They don’t cry about gatha:su (bodies), as pra:na never stays with it permanently. It's better to understand this thaththva (eternal truth). Why? Let's look at a stone. It is also a mix of pancha bhu:thas (five elements). Do we ever cry for that? \nWe get a stone from a mountain, we sculpt it and carve it as stairs. We step on it and walk away. We get another stone from the same mountain, we sculpt it like a doll. We do some purificatory process to it with manthra (mantra) or thanthra (tantra) and mold it as a deity. It is transformed from a doll to a deity or God. We worship it. We treat the stairs in a different way. \nWe brought the stone, hit it, and it has gone through changes. Do we cry for it? Do we feel sad? Why did this stone become like this? We hit this way, that way; do we feel bad for it? Though it is made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements), we are not feeling bad or crying about the changes it goes through. Similarly, we don’t need to cry about atmas (souls), as they never lose pra:na (life force). \nNo need to cry about bodies also as they are not always with pra:na. If we take stone as an example, we don't cry for changes in it; similarly, no need to cry for souls. We should cry for what is worth crying for. If we cry for what's not worth crying for, then that is foolishness. \nThat's why Sri Krishna says - Gatha:sun agatha:su:nscha - gathasu:n (these bodies made of pancha bhu:thas) which were functional for some time with the presence of atma (soul) or pra:na (life force) in them, intelligent folks do not cry for them. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna:nu so:chanthi panditha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIntelligent folks won’t cry for them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhoever you are seeing in front of you, Bhishma, Drona, and other relatives, their bodies are made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements), even yours. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naso:chya:n anva sou:chaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nCrying for what's not worth crying for is unwise.\n-----------------------------------------------\nTalking like a ‘learned man’ about them is referred to as ‘prajna va:da’ (talking about wisdom). That is not the right thing to do. That’s why get a good understanding of atmas (souls) and bodies. When atma (soul) is in the body, bodies get different names and do many activities based on the names they have and the relations they have because of the names. \nUnderstanding those things is our duty as good human beings. Sri Krishna starts the sa:sthra (scripture), the message of Bhagavad Gita, by stating this. It is a science that should be understood by every human being. That’s because these bodies that are made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements), their movement, and indwelling souls are all applicable not to just one country, caste, religion, or race. \nIt is a general principle of living beings and belongs to the whole world. Hence Krishna started explaining the scripture as Bhagavad Gita. How did He start it? We can see how beautifully He started it from verse 12. Let's try to understand it. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), one must prepare a recipient for readiness to listen before imparting a valuable message. The core part is the message. The preparatory part is the introduction or preface of that message. The preface of the Gita (Bhagavad Gita), the science of Gita, is everything that was detailed in the first chapter and through verse 12 of chapter 2. The upadesa (divine message) of Bhagavad Gita begins from the 12th verse. The core upadesa begins from chapter 2 verse 12 and concludes with chapter 18 verse 66. Everything after the message is an epilogue and everything before the message is a prologue. \nSri Krishna delivers the prologue to Arjuna. To alleviate Arjuna’s sorrow, thatthva jnana (knowledge of eternal entities) is necessary. The point when He begins delivering thatthva jnana marks the beginning of Bhagavad Gita. He is trying to deliver transcendental knowledge. We discussed earlier that good knowledge is called pandita (wise person), and the one who has such knowledge is called pandita (wise person). \nHow does one identify the body? How does one identify atma (soul)? This knowledge is known as good knowledge. If we attain this knowledge, we will not experience sorrow in any situation. Superficial, self-taught bookish knowledge is not sufficient in this realm. Superficial understanding obtained simply by listening is also insufficient. Real knowledge is essential. When it is firm in the heart, it also manifests into practice. Just as a tap releases water when the overhead tank is full - when knowledge stands firm, it then matures into practice. Only one who practices it will be relieved from sorrow. That person remains unaffected by proximity or distance from an object or person, regardless of situation, because he possesses true knowledge. That person will be duty-oriented and duty-focused. The root for this is to understand swarupa jnana (knowledge of the nature of the entities). Swarupa jnana is referred to as sastra (scripture).\nSri Krishna begins delivering it from chapter 2 verse 12 of Bhagavad Gita. The 12th verse is as follows…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna thwe: va:ham ja:thu na:sam na thwam ne:me: jana:dhipa:ha|\nna chaiva na bhavishya:maha sarve: vayam athah param||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNeither I, nor you, nor all these kings ever did not exist; nor will we ever cease to exist.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis verse is fascinating. People question why its intent is not stated directly as opposed to the way it is expressed. He said it beautifully, however… na thwe: va:ham ja:thu na:sam (I was never non-existent in the past). He simply could have stated, “I always exist.” However, as they say, double-negatives reinforce strong positives. Thus, using a negating word twice affirms the intended message. Starting with ‘I’, He uses Himself as an example, trying to elaborate on the rest. Who is ‘He’? He is paramatma (supreme soul). Then, what name is used for the rest? They are atmas (souls). I am a soul. You are a soul. He is a soul. She is a soul, etc. \nGenerally, we see and show bodies while using words like her, him, they, them, me, etc. In fact, these identifications do not refer to the body. Why? After some time, when the situation arises, the one we refer to as ‘he’ is ready to be taken away. We don’t say ‘take him’. We say, ‘take it’. The name, ‘he’, is now gone. ‘It’ is used. When someone strongly objects, asking why is ‘he’ referred to as ‘it’, then we hear an emotional response ‘he is gone! he is gone’! Who is ‘he’? Earlier, you were showing the visible body and referring to it as ‘he’. Why do you now say ‘he is gone’? \nWho did you name ‘he’? Not the visible body, but the one with life who left the visible body. The one which has life and was in this body is termed atma (soul). We are referring to the atma as he, she, me, you, us, we, etc. All these names do not refer to the body, but the eternal entity, atma. Why is it named atma? Atma is that which is apnoti (occupying and spreading through whatever it resides within). What does it do as it spreads? Where does it spread to? It spreads within that which it makes as its residence. What does it do as it spreads within? It orders, it drives. \nanthah pravishta sastha (that which enters and directs is named atma). If it spreads through only that which it resides, it is named jivatma (individual soul). Because it enables that specific object to function, it is called jivatma. It is termed jiva (soul), atma, or jivatma. These three are synonyms. Jiva or atma, or the two words together, jivatma, give the same meaning. We must realize they are not different. That which limits itself to only one body, resides in it, uses it, and gives the body life as long as it is in there is termed atma. Because it (atma) is utilizing that which it resides in, that residence is named sharira (body).\nAtma is known as shariri (the one who resides in the body) because it is using something as its sharira and residing in it. Shariri, sharira. Atma [is shariri] and the body is sharira. It [the resident atma] can make use only of its sharira. It cannot control the body next to it. It can only govern and energize every cell of its current body, but not any other body nearby. Thus, jivatma is limited to one body. \nHowever, there is a thatthva (truth) which is not limited to only one body - it spreads throughout everything in existence, including the jivatma, making the entire universe as its body. Not only all physical bodies, but it also makes the resident jivatma as its body, residing in it as its atma and governs it without its knowledge. Such a thatthva that is within everything and governs everything by itself is named as paramatma (supreme soul). This is jivatma, limited to only one body. That which is related to everybody, governing and ruling everything without any hurdle is named as paramatma. \nIt always exists. It is not restricted by time. This atma does not start to exist or stop existing due to any specific process. The battle here (Mahaabharata War) does not destroy atma. It may cause changes to the body which is made of the five elements of nature. However, atma does not change. It never changes, so why worry? He begins by taking Himself as an example for this. He says… \nna thwe: va:ham ja:thu na:sam (I was never non-existent in the past). \nna thwam ne:me: jana:dhipa:ha (nor you, nor all these kings). \nFirst is I, aham (I). Second is You, thwam (you). Third is They [the kings], ime: jana:dhipa:ha (these kings). \nWho does ‘I’ refer to? Is it the body? Who does ‘You’ refer to? The body? Who does ‘They’ refer to? The body? No! We went through such elaborate explanations simply to remember this fact. Here, ‘I’ refers to the indweller of all beings. He exists in every being. He uses Himself as an example. Just as the speaker is certain about the example being used, the listener also must be certain. \nLet’s say we praise someone. “Ah, you look beautiful and pleasant like the moon!” Just as the speaker knows of the moon’s beauty that was referenced, the listener also must know about it. Only then can it be a meaningful example. Therefore, both must have the knowledge of the example being used. He says aham first. \nna thwe: va:ham ja:thu na:sam (I was never non-existent in the past). He started off with, “I was never non-existent in the past…” What this means is that Bhagavan (God), is not Sri Krishna who can be seen at the moment. It is the paramatma thatthva manifested in the form of Sri Krishna. It was in the form of Sri Krishna then. Arjuna also knew this. Not only did he hear it from many sages, elders, and his gurus like Bhishma and Drona, but he also believed it. He therefore says, “Just as you know that I always exist…” He is not referring to the body here. \nBecause the one named Sri Krishna was born on some day and withdrew that form another day. So, if ‘I’ referred to the body in ‘aham - I always exist’, it becomes a contradiction because there was a time of birth and a time of end to the body. When He said, ‘I was never non-existing…’ He is not referring to the body. He is referring to the atma thatthva. Arjuna and He both have clarity on this aspect. Using this as the example, He says ‘thwam - you were also never non-existing’. However, isn’t there a date of birth for him? \nIme: Jana:dhipaha - He refers to ‘them - all these kings!’ They all have dates of birth, right? They also will die in the war. Then, why does He say that they were never non-existent? Therefore, He is not referring to the bodies. The words aham, thwam, and ime: are referring to the resident atma thatthva. He is elaborating the atma thatthva. He is doing so by using what is already known, Himself, as the example to prove the eternity of the atmas (souls). He explains this in chapter 2, verse 12, beginning to lead us further into the sastra (scripture). \nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), today we delve into the profound teachings of the Vedas, which serve as a treasure-trove of knowledge, providing mankind with essential understanding of all entities. \nThe term Veda (knowledge) refers to that which gives knowledge to those who are worthy of knowing. It outlines the dos and don’ts, clarifying what is to be done and what isn’t, specifying responsibilities and prohibitions, and describing what is worth pursuing and what is not. The Vedas explain everything, guiding us on how to lead a normal life, and are therefore also known as physical science. They provide insights into the nature of life, termed as thatthva jna:na (knowledge of reality), which the wise ought to know.\nThe part of the Vedas that elucidates what is eternal versus temporary, what brings eternal bliss versus temporary happiness, is called Upanishad. This section is also referred to as Vedanta, the most critical and beautiful part of the Vedas. Such knowledge is not accessible to those who lack eagerness to learn. Our Elders say that Vedanta jna:na (knowledge of Vedanta) or Upanishad jna:na can only be attained by an interested aspirant who seeks it from Elders.\nWhere does this knowledge appear within the Vedas? It can be found anywhere - at the beginning, middle, or end. Some claim it is only at the end, hence the name Vedanta (Veda + antha, meaning end), but there is no rule stating it must be exclusively at the end. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkasmai de:va:yah avisha: vidha:ma:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTo whom do we offer the results of our work?\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis mantra reveals thatthva jna:na (knowledge of reality) and is found within the Vedic texts. Thus, Vedanta is not limited to the ending; it exists throughout. What is thatthva (supreme governing entity)? Who do we worship other than the One who provides us this world full of life as our abode? \nThe answer to this question exists somewhere in the Vedas, indicating that Vedanta can be found at the end, in between, or at the beginning - it can exist anywhere! Vedanta is what one must know; it reveals truths and the essence of thatthva. This is what we call Vedanta or Upanishad. \nThe summary of all these Upanishads is the Bhagavad Gita. There are 1131 branches in the Vedas, each containing the Upanishad part, which reveals essential truths. Bhagavan Sri Krishna recognized that it would be challenging for us to learn all of this. Therefore, He took the responsibility of consolidating it into an easily understandable format and presented it to us as the Bhagavad Gita.\nLike a skilled pharmacist gathering various medicinal leaves, grinding, boiling, filtering, and creating a concentrated essence, Bhagavan Sri Krishna also brought together the essence of Vedanta or Upanishads in an understandable form as the Bhagavad Gita, using Arjuna as an example. \nThus, the course of the Bhagavad Gita progresses similarly to the Upanishads while presenting truths. Among the Upanishads, the Chandogya begins to expound thatthva (eternal reality) by stating…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsade:va sowmya idamagra a:si:th e:kame:va advithi:yam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn the beginning, there was only that which is true, one without a second.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt starts with sade:va (that which is true). Sath (truth) is the only key entity. It illustrates that the same entity manifested as idam (this). What does ‘this’ refer to? It refers to everything we see today with different names, forms, and shapes, as various activities spread out in various ways - i.e., this world.\nSade:va! It gradually grew to this when sath expanded itself, similar to a tiny seed growing into a large, wonderful tree, manifesting in various forms and shapes. Just as the seed and the tree are the same, sath is also the cause of this world. Thus, it is a mantra that teaches about the causal entity. \nIt is a sruthi (Veda) named ‘sade:va sowmya…’ What does sath mean? Sath means that which does not change during all three divisions of time - past, present, and future.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthraika:lika aba:dhyathva\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThat which does not undergo change across all three times.\n-----------------------------------------------\nInterestingly, because Sri Krishna employs the same method to explain the intended thatthva, He uses the same process, stating that they are all like thatthva, which does not undergo any change at thrika:la (all three divisions of time). \nSo beautiful…! What is He saying here [chapter 2, verse 12]?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna thwe: va:ham ja:thu na:sam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere is never a time that I did not exist.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is saying the same here as well. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna chaiva na bhavishya:ma sarve: vayam athah param\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere was never a time when we did not exist, nor a time when we will cease to exist.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt’s never the case that I don’t exist, that you don’t exist, or that they all don’t exist. This means we all exist during all three divisions of time, indicating that our nature is sath. He is using the same process as the Upanishads to teach us.\nWhat did the Upanishad state there [Chandogya Upanishad]? Because it says ‘sath’, it starts by stating ‘that substance called sath…’. Such reference is called indirect reference. If the same is shown directly, it is called direct reference. \nThe Upanishads use indirect reference, stating that sath always exists. Sri Krishna does not reference it indirectly; He speaks directly, depicting Himself as an example.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naham ja:thu na:sam ithi na\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere is never a time that I don’t exist.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is presenting the same in a direct manner. We must have all heard the following:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbha:ratham panchamo: ve:daha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe Mahabharata is the fifth Veda.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe four Vedas are Ruk, Yajus, Sama, and Atharva. This means that the essence of Vedic truth is clearly shown here. If the Mahabharata is considered a Veda, then just as the Upanishads relate to the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita relates to the Mahabharata.\nAll the words used in the Upanishads to explain parama:thma (the supreme soul) are present in the Bhagavad Gita. All those words depict Him. The ultimate consequence of any word is parama:thma.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsarve: ve:da: yathpadama:mananthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll the Vedas speak of the ultimate reality.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe essence specified clearly by all letters existing in the Vedas is the word Om. The same comes a little later in the Bhagavad Gita.\nWhat does Om mean? He shows Himself as the meaning of Om.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\no:m ithye:ka:ksharam bramha vya:hran ma:m anusmaran\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSay Om; the essence you must see when you say it is Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBecause when we utter any word, we must also understand its meaning. When asked for a word’s meaning, we should identify the object it denotes, not its translation in another language. \nFor example: what is a ‘pilli’? It is a cat (in Telugu). What is a cat? It is ‘billi’. What is a ‘billi’? It is punai. Providing the word’s translation in different languages doesn’t qualify as giving its meaning. \nIf you can clarify the word’s meaning, i.e., the object it reflects, regardless of the language, only then does it mean that you have understood and described the word. All words ultimately reach and merge into God. All words that describe thatthva (truth) reach God. \nThe Chandogya Upanishad uses the word sath. The Upanishad itself states that the word ‘sath’ also arrives and reaches Him. All words like sath, jyo:thi (light), bramha (ultimate reality), akshara (imperishable), a:ka:sa (space) - where do they all meet? What is the underlying thatthva of all these words? \nWhen such questions arise…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndivyo: de:va e:ka na:ra:yanaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe one radiating, possessing the power to easily manifest the universe is the thatthva named Narayana.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe word used is vise:sha shabda (specific word), a term that describes only one. Other words are like pronouns; they can denote anyone. For example, the word ‘he’ can refer to anyone based on context. It is a pronoun used generally. \nHowever, when you say Narayana, it cannot refer to anyone else. The Vedas clearly state that all such words used to refer to anyone ultimately converge in a unique thatthva named Narayana. The same thatthva is referred to as sath in the beginning. \nJust as sath converges to Narayana, and because Sri Krishna embodies Narayana here, the word aham (I) is used as an example to refer to Himself, explaining the atma (soul) thatthva. Thus, Sri Krishna begins the scripture with:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna thwe: va:ham ja:thu na:sam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere is never a time that I did not exist.\n-----------------------------------------------\nInitially, it may be a little difficult, yet let’s try to carefully understand and relish this.

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a sastra (scripture). What does sastra mean? It is that which commands. What does it command? It declares and presents the truths that one must know. It clarifies which entities are eternal and which are not, and how we should conduct ourselves with everything. \nWhat are all these visible elements? What are the underlying ruling tattvas (truths), the invisible entities? What is the supporting base of everything? These questions arise because none are visible to the naked eye! As they are not visible, they need to be explained explicitly. Mahānubhāva (great being), Sri Krishna took the responsibility of explaining these to us. We refer to sastra as that which proves something to be what it truly is. This is Bhagavad Gita sastra, science. It describes tattva, the truth of every entity.\nWhenever we delve into a scientific topic, we must have a basic understanding of certain aspects. If we have this fundamental knowledge, we can then relish the contents happily. For example, if we were to learn physics, we must have knowledge of some basic scientific principles. If we were to learn chemistry, then we need to know some basic facts like symbols and related terminologies. If we know the terminology, we can then happily enjoy it. Otherwise, it can give a bad headache. It is the same for the science of Bhagavad Gita.\nTherefore, we need a basic understanding of certain terms like ātma (soul), śarīra (body), deha (physical form), parama ātma (Supreme Soul), etc. To help us attain that knowledge, Sri Krishna begins Gita Sastra from chapter 2, verse 12. How does it start?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna thwe: va:ham ja:thu na:sam na thwam ne:me: jana:dhipa:ha|\nna chaiva na bhavishya:maha sarve: vayam athah param||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere was never a time that I did not exist, nor you, nor these kings; and there will never be a time that we will not exist in the future.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe must remember the three: aham (Me, Sri Krishna); thwam (you, who is in front of Me); ime (these, who are in front of us). Also, there will never be a time in the future that we won’t exist. Sarve vayam athah param (there is never a time that we won’t exist). There was never a time we didn’t exist, never a time we are not existing, and never a time that we will not exist. \nHe is explicitly declaring that they always exist by using two negatives - na ithi na (not existing is never the case) to reinforce a strong positive. Who is He referring to? Is He referring to His body when He said aham? Is He referring to Arjuna’s body, visible in front of Him, when He said thwam? Is He referring to the warriors’ bodies that are surrounding them when He said ime? We must think about this. We must know that the answer is ‘No’. Why? \nAham ja:thu na:sam ithi na (I was never non-existent) does not go along with the rest. Because it is evident that He was born on Śrāvaṇa (month), Bahula (waning phase), Ashtami (eighth day), and Rohini (star). How can He say that He was ‘not non-existing’ in the past? It was 6 months later that Arjuna, being referred to as thwam, was born. \nNa:si:hi ithi na ja:thu (you were also never not existing in the past) would be wrong. In the same way, He says ‘ime: jana:dhipa:ha’ (these were also never not existing)? How can He say that? They were also born on a specific day! Those standing in front of Him are related as sons, brothers, brothers-in-law, maternal uncles, fathers, grandfathers, etc. They all must have been born on some day, isn’t it? \nTherefore, the words ‘never not existing’ are not referring to the visible body. They are referring to the resident jīva (soul) of the body. We must remember this. He is referring to jīva and not the body. Similarly, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna bhavishya:maha sarve: vayam athah param\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthere will never be a time in the future when we will not exist.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat it means is that they will always exist. If it referred to the body, this statement also would be false. Why? Because He eventually concluded the avatāra (incarnation) Sri Krishna being referred to as Himself. Experts who study time say that Kali Yuga (age of darkness) commenced with the end of His avatāra. Panchaṅga (Vedic calendar) states that Kali Yuga commenced 5,120 years ago. \nWhat it means is that He also has a concluding time for His avatāra(s). When He says that ‘I will never be not existing’, is He referring to the body? He is not referring to the body named Sri Krishna. He is referring to the parama tattva (Supreme truth) of Sri Krishna. In the same way, when He says ‘you will never be not existing’, He is not referring to the body of Arjuna. He is referring to the ātma tattva (soul truth) in the body of Arjuna. \nIme: jana:dhipa:ha na bhavishyanthi ithi ja:thu na (there will never be a time where they do not exist) means that the resident ātma tattvas in them will always exist. He is clearly stating this and we must remember it. Sri Krishna separates all into three entities, Me – You – They. ‘Me’ represents parama tattva, ‘You’ represents jīva tattva (soul truth), the jīva that exists in different forms with different names limited to different bodies, hence the word ‘they’.\nMany people do not know this, and so they question… What is this, why should God give us such a birth? Why is He giving us this karma (action)? Why is He letting us go through difficult times? Several such questions! That’s because they lack fundamental knowledge. What is the fundamental knowledge here? \nĀtma is not something that takes birth on a day or dies another day. Ātma is not single; it is many. What it means is that we are all ātmas. We never take birth. We don’t die. We always exist. Then, what does it mean by Him creating us, why do we say He created us different from each other? Then, where do all the differences in experiences and appearances come from? \nThese are a result of one’s own karma, actions. Why can’t God erase it all and make us all the same? Why should He? Then, what does He do? Even if jīva has karma, he doesn’t have the power to. Ātma does not have the ability to decide and create an appropriate body for clearing accumulated karma. This process is the way to free the self and know its (ātma’s) true nature. \nThe process of being given a body is the way to liberation and to discover the ātma’s true nature. It does not have the decisive power to manage its karma which blocks it from knowing its true nature. Therefore, because ātma cannot do this itself, God comes forward by giving an appropriate body and necessary environment to allow the soul to clear its karma. \nWe must remember the example of a seed here. We sow 10 different seeds, each yielding various results. There is someone who sowed the seeds. Do we fight with the farmer because there is a difference in the yield of each seed? Why did this yield such a fruit? Why did this one yield big fruit, small fruit, mango, guava, etc.? Do we argue with him, claiming that he is partial, exclaiming ‘he has done something to give such results to each?’ No, right?! Why? \nThe seed does not have the ability to create an environment to let itself grow from what is in it; it does not have the ability to utilize its consciousness. Therefore, the farmer, a great being, sows it in the soil thereby letting the inner consciousness of the seed flourish. Whatever is in the seed is what is sprouting. Does the farmer have any responsibility for the result? Do we punish or praise him? \nSimilarly, God integrates jīva with prakṛti (nature), giving an appropriate deha (body) to enable him to consume karma through various experiences – happy and sad, various śarīras (bodies), etc. Because he (jīva) cannot create a body for himself, He (parama ātma) is being helpful and creates it. \nUbhow: yacchathi (He brings them both together). Jīva is named sat (existence). Prakṛti is named thi (nature). Yam yacchathi means to bring together. Parama ātma is called sathyam (truth) - sat + thi + yam because He creates an environment that enables one to consume what has been accumulated. \nAlso, karma is the cause for the differences. One doesn’t know how long one has been accumulating it. Akin to how Sri Krishna stated in ‘na thwe: va:ham’ that You, Me, and They exist in past, present, and future, jīva’s karma also has been with him since the time he existed. When did it begin (ādi)? We don’t know. It is called anādi (beginningless) because we don’t know. \nThus, He is not the one who brings all the differences. We are responsible for accumulating them by choice. He is only enabling the experiences. Thus, we need not complain about Him. He is showing the categorization in na thwe: va:ham verse. Aham (Me), Thwam (You), Ime: (They) – all exist forever. Bodies emerge one day and dissolve another day. It is the jīvas that are said to be eternal. \nBodies are referred to as gathasūvas (temporary bodies). Separately, jīvas are referred to as agathasūvas (eternal souls) and are said to exist eternally. When they are combined, we can perceive consciousness via that (prakṛti, nature in the form of a body). When not combined, we are not aware of where jīva exists. However, prakṛti spreads throughout existence. \nClarifying this, Sri Krishna, parama ātma, moves forward in elaborating Gita Sastra, the science of Gita. Let us try to learn further.

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita upadesa (teaching) has begun. While the Bhagavad Gita has 700 verses, the core upadesa begins from chapter 2, verse 12, concluding with chapter 18, verse 66. Therefore, verse 18.66, ‘sarva dharman…’ is named charama sloka (final verse), the last verse of God’s upadesa.\nThere are verses after it, and also before verse 2.12. However, the verses before 2.12, ‘na thwe va:ham ja:thu na:sam…’ are together termed purva pitika (prologue). Similarly, there are verses after verse 66, chapter 18. They are together termed uththara pitika (epilogue). He prepared for the closing [in the epilogue]. The essence of God’s upadesa lies in between [the preface and the epilogue].\nAs Sri Krishna graces Arjuna with verse 12, He begins by explaining ji:va thathva (the nature of the soul). Why? Arjuna was in grief because he had to face and fight ji:vas (souls) such as Dro:na and Bhi:shma in the war. He expressed his doubts as…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyadva: jaye:ma yadi va: no: jaye:yuhu\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"Whether we win or lose, what will happen?\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe was thinking that it would be good if their side won. Whereas, if the other party won, all of them would have to face exile. Winning, however, means that warriors on the other side lose their life. “Oh no! I am going to have to kill them… guru:n (teachers)!” “They are all my elders, teachers, those who taught me right and wrong since my childhood.” “How can I kill such people in war?” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyushibhi prathi yo:thsya:mi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"How can I fire arrows against and injure them?\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe asked Him [Sri Krishna] how he is supposed to harm those ji:vas! Sri Krishna desired to clarify to Arjuna who exactly he has to kill, or do anything else. He said… Anyone in your or the opposite army is each a union of two things, deha (body) and atma (soul). What we see is the union of the two. Ji:va (soul) is part of the union but not visible. Deha (body) is the other part of the union and is visible.\nFirstly, He wants to tell him [Arjuna] that no matter what he does to them, they do not die. Therefore, He begins to reveal the ji:va’s true swarupa (form). Secondly, He wants to clarify that ji:va thathva is not one in number. He wants to clarify that Brahma Tathva (the ultimate reality) is not the only existing thathva and that ji:va thathva also exists. Ji:vas exist and are countless in number. There is a natural state to these ji:vas. He wants to reveal all of this.\nHence in verse 2.12, He separates the three: I, you, or them. I, You, Them. I am different from you. You and the rest of them are all different from each other. They all have their bodies as tools to accomplish their duties as soldiers, rulers, or anyone else. The bodies change. The indwelling residents do not change. He must first clarify that the indwelling ji:vas do not change. He must clarify that no matter what he does to them, they do not die. \n[Arjuna] is in grief because he thinks they will die. If he is wise, realizing there is no death to them, his grief should subside. Thus, there is a need to tell him that they won’t die. He therefore says that neither I nor you…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nime: jana:dhipa:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"...and all of them\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nna chaiva na bhavishya:mahasarve: vayamathah param||\n\"Not just now, yesterday or tomorrow, there is never a time when we do not exist.\" \nHe firmly clarified the truth that everyone exists forever. He now wants to clarify that ji:va and body are not the same. The statement that ‘we all exist always’ raises a question about its validity… as one may feel that he did not exist earlier, and the others did not exist earlier. You say we always exist. What does it mean that we all always exist? One may feel… He was young some years ago, and has grown older now. \nHow can you say we exist forever; that there is never a time we do not exist? He [Sri Krishna] needs to clarify this aspect. The eternally existing entities are the resident ji:vas who are identifiable by a name [through the body]. The body is a different entity. There is now a need to clarify to Arjuna that bodies are different; they are not the same entities as ji:vas. Earlier, it was only clarified that there is never a time that they don’t exist.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna bhavishya:ma ithi na\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"Ji:vas always exist.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nNow, He must clarify how they exist forever. To explain this, He begins with an example. He begins describing the changes that happen to the body and clarifies that such changes do not apply to the ji:va. As a child, one refers to himself as ‘I’. Even as he grows older and older, he continues to refer to himself as ‘I’. As an old man, he refers to himself as ‘I’. Whoever is referring to himself as ‘I’ is utilizing a tool termed a body to perform his work. He is not the one changing, but his tool is going through change.\nThe body is changing from one state to another; the change is visible. Right? It changes from being a child-type body to a youth-type body. Does anyone young cry about not having a child-type body? Actually, people explicitly state the increased age and celebrate birthdays giving treats to everyone, enjoying the day. They aren’t crying about it. He transforms from a youngster to an old man. That is also celebrated. \nThe indweller hasn’t changed, but his body has. He says, “you know, as a child…I was so good” or “when I was young, I would do great things… now I have grown older.” As he gets older, he recognizes the age of the body. While all other birthdays are celebrated, the 60th birthday celebration is special and is called sashtyabdi. The 70th birthday is named sapthadi. The 80th birthday has yet another name! The 83rd is named sahasra chandra! One is not sad to grow older. He is celebrating and happy. \nHe is clearly expressing that he is attaining something again and again, but not saying that he is changing. The body which he feels as belonging to him is the one going through change. He is not crying about this change. An unwise one cries about it. A wise one does not do that. A wise one is happy about the change. You can see that some people are happy about it [as they celebrate birthdays]. \nHe wants to explain that change is natural for a body, and it’s not appropriate to cry over it. He explains this in verse 13.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nde:hino:smin yattha: de:he:\nkauma:ram yauvanam jara:|\nthattha: deha:nthara pra:pthihi\ndhi:ras thathra na muhyathi||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"The one who dwells in the body is not affected by the changes of the body.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe refers to this body as deha and refers to the indweller, us, as dehi. The one in this deha is named dehi. Deha is defined as that which gradually accumulates material from outside and grows accordingly. It is called upacheyam (that which gradually accumulates things and grows). It [body] is gradually changing for him. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyattha: kauma:ram yauvanam jara\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"Initially, there is a baby body changing into a child body followed by an adolescent body and finally an old age body.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nAll this change is happening, isn’t it? He is not crying over these bodily changes - he is taking the body through a certain transformation. Similarly, we need not cry when leaving this body and moving to another.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthattha: deha:nthara pra:pthihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"Even as you move from this body to another.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\ndhi:raha thathra na muhyathi\n\"A wise one does not cry.\" Someone unwise enough would cry over it. “Oh no! I have lost my childhood. I want it back!” Who would say something like this? One may say so for the sake of expression via a poem, as an outpouring wish to escape from difficulties during later stages of life. A wise one, however, does not cry recollecting old times. He will happily accept what has come through. Dhi:raha! \ndhi: (wisdom) Dhi:ra is one who uses and enjoys buddhi (intellect). na muhyathi (he does not ever get confused). He knows it. It is natural that one leaves the current body and goes to another. \nLet’s take an example. Someone asks, ‘Is your father there?’ The response, ‘No, he is not at home.’ What does that mean? If he is not at home, he is somewhere else. He may be outside, or at work, or has left for some other place. In the same way… After gradually transforming from one stage to another in this changing body, a tool formed for his use… if he is not in this anymore, it implies that he is somewhere else. \nTherefore, a ji:va always exists. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndeha:nthara pra:pthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"He left this one, implying he has made another one his home.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is never going to be non-existing. Bodily change is natural. No matter what you do with the body, it is impossible for it to remain as is. It is against nature. Therefore, it is inevitable to leave it and it is also inevitable to enter another one. “Even if you decide not to kill them in the war today, they have to leave their bodies at some point.” “If they leave it in the right way, it is a celebratory event for them.” “If you become a reason for that, you should feel happy as well, not cry about it.” \nThus, to relieve Arjuna’s grief, Sri Krishna begins explaining that deha (body) and the indwelling ji:va (soul) are not the same. Let’s move further as He elaborates. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 36,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is an upade:sa (divine teaching) given by God to enable wise ones to distinguish what is permanent and what is temporary. The upade:sa begins from sloka 2.12. First, God explains ji:va thaththva (the nature of the soul). He states that ji:vas (souls) do not get destroyed. Sari:ra (the body) goes through transformation and gets disintegrated too. He is yet to state this and the relation between the two. He needs to clarify that the body is what goes through changes, and what does not is the a:thma (soul). There is no need to cry over what does not change. There is no use crying over what changes. \nIf one cries that a cloud in the sky is moving away because of the wind, is there any use? It takes its due course. Waves in the river come and go. Is there any use crying over this? They take their due course. The sun rises in the east and gradually sets in the west. There is no use weeping over the sun taking his path. No one can stop him. It is meaningful to cry about something that can be prevented or worked on. It is foolish to cry over what we have no control over. Therefore, that is not necessary for you! You cannot stop the transformation of a body. You cannot do anything to bring change to an a:thma. Both are not in your hands. Why cry over a:thma that does not change? Why cry over the body that is bound to change?\nSo, does the ji:va (soul) in the body reside throughout, or is it limited to a specific spot in the body? He must first clarify this. Ve:das (Vedas) have talked about this. He also discusses it later on. Ji:va is an anu swaru:pa (minute form), smaller than the smallest known form. Therefore, ji:va is only in one specific spot in the body. You may say, how can that be true? I can feel when one touches my leg, head, stomach, back. Hence, doesn’t ji:va occupy the entire body? No, says the Ve:das!\nThere is an Upanishad named Cha:ndo:gya. In the 11th part of the sixth section, he gives a wonderful example. What is it? Have you ever seen a fully grown tree? The disciple Swe:thake:thu says he has seen one. His guru is Uddha:laka. The disciple is a young boy named Swe:thake:thu. His father (and guru) must give knowledge of thaththva (truth) to the boy. As he was trying to do that, he said he wanted to use the tree as an example. That’s because he could not use the boy’s body as an example. He must explain that the ji:va resides in a specific spot in the body and spreads throughout the body. \nHe must show that even if a hand (a part of the body) is cut, ji:va remains intact. He cannot cut the boy’s hand, right? We can hear from the ear, we can speak. We can feel so until about here (pointing to a specific point). Ji:va exists within even if a part is missing. Ji:va exists without a hand or a leg. If ji:va occupied the entire body, he should not remember the events prior to the leg being cut. He should not have that memory. However, that’s not the case. Isn’t it? \nLet’s say one loses legs in an accident somehow. He remembers pre-accident times such as, “I was a great runner when I had my legs, always winning gold medals.” He has the memory of running. He remembers the accolades won back then! What does that mean? There is something that is remembering what he did when he had the legs. Therefore, a:thma does not fill the entire body. It is practically difficult to demonstrate this on the boy’s body. Hence, the father tells Swe:thake:thu that he will use the tree as an example. \nHe takes him to the tree. Father: Cut down a branch. Let’s assume that ji:va is occupying the entire tree. Okay? Let’s assume that the tree is filled with ji:va. Every anu (atom) of it has the ji:va. Father: Now, cut down a branch. The tree is just fine. Now, do not cut the branch. Carefully, bend it to the extent that it is almost cut out. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nabhya:hanya:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhat happens?\nji:van srave:th\na fluid drips from it\nIt’s called sap. The tree is leaking sap. What it means is that there is ji:va in it. If we break a dried-up branch, there is nothing in it. We don’t know. However, if we bend a branch of a living tree, it leaks sap. He asks to rest it (branch) there. He takes him there the following day. Until yesterday, it was nice and green with life. How is it today?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsushya:thi, adhasa: sushyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\ndried, further dried the following day\nWhy did it dry up now? There is something called ji:va that existed in the tree earlier, spreading its power throughout the tree. Therefore, it was all looking alive. The ji:va that resides somewhere is there. However, when you separated the part today, the pra:nana shakthi (life-giving power) that it released, retracted from the separated part. Therefore, the branch that has been cut or bent has dried up, sushyathi (has dried). \nIt is the same case with any part. “Father, I want to see that,” said the boy. Let’s observe. He cut down the second branch.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nadhasa:pi sushyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nit also dried up gradually\nWhichever branch he cut, only that branch was drying out, but the tree was just fine. If he cuts down the root…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsarvam jaha:thi, sarvasusshyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nif the root is taken out, the entire dries out\nTherefore, there is ji:va somewhere in the tree. As long as he is there, no matter what branch you cut down… Only the cut down branch gets dried out, but the rest looks alive… flowering as usual, yielding fruit, and no limitations. The limitation is only for the branch that was cut. What it means is that the life-giving power from it stopped reaching the branch and therefore it dried out. When you cut the root, the ji:va that’s giving the power to the entire tree, left it. Earlier, he (the ji:va) left only the cut down branch. Therefore, it dried out. When you cut the root, he…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsarvam jaha:thi sarvaha sushyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen you take him out from the root, the entire tree dried out.\nWhat do you understand from this? Ji:va exists in one specific spot. He releases and spreads life-giving force all throughout. The ji:va who spreads it throughout is different from that which is spread out as a tree, the body. We can perceive this. Whatever part we cut, his power to that part is retracted and therefore it dries out, but he stays there. This is what we understand here. \nIt is termed de:ha (body) when growing. As it begins to wane, it is termed sari:ra (physical form). Gradually, it…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsi:ryathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nbegins to wane\nHowever, he (ji:va) is separate from it (body). Wherever he (ji:va) finds it necessary, he retracts it from there. If he (ji:va of tree) is together with it (body of the tree), he releases and spreads it (life-giving energy) to it. It’s the same case with us. Ji:va exists here in a specific spot. He has a sakthi vise:sha (special power) termed jna:na (knowledge) as referred to by our people. He releases this knowledge to all parts of the body. Therefore, all parts work. For some reason, if any body part is cut off, only the power radiated to that part is retracted; however, ji:va does not leave the body. He is in this (the body). \nAt some point in time, however, he leaves (the body) too. Just like how he retracts power from a specific part of the body that is separated, there will be a day when he needs to leave the entire body. We must know this. What does it mean? The visible body is different from the resident ji:va. The ji:va is in a minute form, therefore invisible. The body is macro, hence visible. We simply do not know that he (ji:va) does not change. Hence, it is essential to be told. Bodily changes can be noticed; hence it is essential to specify that ji:va doesn’t change (despite the changes in body). \nWe see it in usual conduct too. It is therefore explained that the body has change associated with it. It is also explained that ji:va does not change. It is also explained that ji:va someday leaves the body. The body goes through change followed by transformation. When we looked at the tree as an example, there is growth followed by drying out when separated. It is the same in this body as well. He gradually grows this body. He does not grow. Ultimately when he leaves, the body also turns into a useless state. Trees are a good example for us. When cut, they become a stick. Our people refer to a dead body with the same name, stick! We use the same sticks to qualify it for the future. \nTake any species. It is the same process. It can be human, animal, microorganism, insect, tree, or others. Therefore, trees also have life. There are ji:vas in trees too. That ji:va is always in union with God. Where there is a body, there is a ji:va. That ji:va refers to this as ‘I’. He also refers to it as ‘mine’. ‘I’ and ‘mine’ refer to the body + the ji:va who is residing in it + God who governs everyone - the three thaththvas (truths) are always in union. We must remember this. A wise one who knows this will never be in sorrow. \nThis is what He explains in verse 2.13 of Bhagavad Gita.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nde:hino:smin yattha: de:he: kauma:ram yauvanam jara:|\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthattha: deha:nthara pra:pthihi dhi:raha thathra na muhyathi||\nA wise one must observe this fact. Therefore, it is not essential to cry. I think you are also a wise one. Therefore, it is not necessary to be sad! Oh no! \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkatham ishubhih prathiyo:thsya:mi guru:n ahathva: hi maha:nubha:va:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nA wise one shouldn’t be crying this way. You are also a wise one. Therefore, put away the sorrow. Perform your duty properly. In safeguarding the people’s well-being, his (Arjuna’s) duty is now to eliminate evil. Therefore, He (Sri Krishna) is moving ahead, encouraging him to fight in the war. He proves this more clearly later; let us find out how as we move further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), When visible things require detailed description to have clear and complete knowledge of them, one has to exercise tremendous effort to describe and help us understand the invisible truths, right? In Bhagavad Gita chapter 2, Bhagavan (the Lord) began to describe atma (soul) and deha (body). Why? Because...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntharathi so:kam a:thmavith\nSLOKA MEANING -\nonly a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul) can free one from sorrows\n-----------------------------------------------\nWithout atma jna:na, the person cannot come out of his sorrows. This is stated in the Vedas. Arjuna is now in sorrow and needs to recover. To bring him out of it, he must be taught atma jna:na. However, atma is invisible and deha is visible. We do not even know everything clearly about the visible deha. \nTo understand that the visible deha is panchabhu:tha:thmakam (made of the five elements of nature), we need a detailed explanation. It (deha) consists of the Earth element. Because it is soft, it consists of water. It has temperature, so it consists of tejas (heat). Since we inhale and exhale, it consists of air. It has space for what we ingest, so it consists of akasam (space). We sometimes hear sounds from inside the body, so it has ether.\nTo explain to someone that it (deha) is made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements), the listener should have foundational basic knowledge. Such a person can be taught. Now he has to be taught about atma, but it is invisible. How to identify atma? It can be identified by deha only. Atma is identified through the movements of the visible deha. Atma cannot be seen in any other way.\nSo, in Bhagavad Gita 2.13, Sri Krishna is trying to describe the effects seen in the visible body and the truth of the invisible atma.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nde:hino:smin yatha: de:he: \nkauma:ram yavvanam jara:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe deha (body) possessed by the indwelling one goes through various changes: childhood, adolescence, youth, and old age.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe deha is going through these changes. Who is going through these? Deha is going through them, and the one who has this deha is observing them. Deha (the body) and dehi (the soul). The one residing inside is named as dehi. He thinks that he can see the changes the deha is undergoing. Just as these changes are unavoidable...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthatha: deha:nthara pra:pthihi:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nsimilarly, entering another deha (body) is also inevitable\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is describing the body and the resident in the body separately. He says both are different. One of them undergoes changes, and atma does not change. For my deha, I observed childhood, youth, and old age. One who sees them is a truth, but the undergoing change is in the other truth, deha. \nAs previously discussed, atma shall be identified by deeds. In fact, it is difficult for atma to have its identity without a body. Neither can it be identified nor can it act without a body. So deha can provide identity to the existence of atma. However, it (atma) will not change like its identifier (body).\nThere is no guarantee that the soul will get another body. We do not know, right? How will we know if this person has got another body? If we know that, we can identify the person. If a person owes us and dies suddenly, once we know he entered another body, we will immediately identify him and ask him to clear the debt. \n[sarcastically] Luckily, we do not know where the soul is going next and how he (his body) looks… but clearly, the person exists. One thing to remember is, when in a deha, childhood, youth, and old age all occur in the same body. Because they occur in the same body, they are clearly interrelated. Since we cannot see the new body, the link between the old and new deha is not known. \nBecause we see the link between the three stages (of an existing body), we do not mourn. However, when the soul enters another deha, we do not see any link. Therefore, Sri Krishna had to describe it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthatha deha:ntharapra:pthihi bhavathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nhe will get another deha (body)\n-----------------------------------------------\nThen why are we not able to see it (link between the two bodies)? Not being able to see it is something different. Just because we don’t see it, we cannot say it does not exist. For example, we do not mourn when one of our relatives is leaving via bus. He will call us back saying he reached his destination. You are then happy, aren’t you? \nBecause we physically see the bus, and we know when it reaches the destination, we have confidence. Similarly with a train. Even in the case of an airplane, for example, we see someone off to America. The person will reach and call us the next day saying “I reached home safely.” This makes us happy, right? \nAlthough there is no link between the two places, we still inquire if the person has reached safely. Aren’t you trusting it and recognizing the change, or not? You do. Because of communication via phone, we have trust. When the soul enters another body, he does not communicate with the old deha or anyone related to it, so we mourn. However, he exists there.\nWhat are we interested in though? Will he exist or get destroyed? This is our problem. Arjuna is sad because all these people will cease to exist. However, the souls referred to as (Bhi:shma and Dro:na) will not be destroyed, and nothing will happen to them. Just like one boarding a train or a flight reaches the destination, similarly the soul enters another deha and resides there.\nJust as one boards a flight based on his work and need, similarly the soul leaves one deha. He is in one vehicle (deha) until now, which he leaves and moves from based on the karma (actions) he needs to experience in the next one. Until then, he stays in this body to fulfill his duty resulting from specific karma, accepting the changes it goes through. \nFollowing this karma, he enters a new deha and continues to experience the rest. Because we do not see the link between two places, the person needs to inform us that he has reached the destination. But we also wonder… These days, new equipment and devices allow videos. We also have some packages that give us live updates when a flight takes off and lands. \nOnce he reaches home, the person also video chats with his parents. We do not have any devices yet, or any applications and packages which track the journey of the soul from one body to another. We do not have any device to identify the soul and so no device yet to track its journey. \nWhy doesn’t the soul communicate with previous relatives as the person was so attached to them, so much in love with them, unhappy to leave the loved ones for a moment? So attached that they would eat and sleep together always! It is because the person behaves like this until fulfilling his karma. Once he fulfills his karma, the record gets cleared. \nWhat comes next depends on his next karma. If he enters the body of devatha (divine being), he experiences what exists there, but he will not think of anything from the past. The part of Veda which talks about jiva (individual soul) attaining moksha (liberation) says...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nno:pajanan smaran idam sari:ram\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAfter the demise of a person, he does not care about people who cry for him.\n-----------------------------------------------\nEven though the person crying might be the most loved one, the soul does not look back and think about it. Why? Because the relationships, love and affection, hatred and anger are all a result of deha. All these exist only with the deha. In Ramayana, Sri Rama preaches to Vibhi:shana...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmarana:nthani:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll these are only until death, i.e. the soul exiting deha.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe does not think of anything that affects the deha or the relations that come with this deha after leaving it. One might say, “he told me ‘I will take you with me within a year’.” Even though he said so, the person does not recall the past. He behaves according to the karma he must go through next and does not remember anything from the past. \nHe does not have deha: bandhu bhranti (illusion of body relationships), no link with the deha or the associations. As we discussed, after traveling in flight, the person reaches his destination, similarly the soul continues to exist (elsewhere). You (Arjuna) need to understand that just as the soul remains unaffected though deha undergoes change, it also remains unaffected when it migrates from one deha to another.\nIn the 12th sloka...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna thwe:va:ham ja:thu na:samI \nna chaiva na bhavishya:mas sarve: vayam athah param II\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is said about him, the soul. The bodies that you see and identify as you, me and others, will definitely undergo change.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThat is why...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndhi:raha: thathra namahyuthi:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nA wise person should neither mourn about these changes [of the body], nor for the journey of a soul to another deha.\n-----------------------------------------------\nvika:ra he:thav sathi vikriyanthe: ye:sham na chetha:msi \ntha yeva: dhi:raha: \nOne who does not change even when there is necessity or opportunity... one who does not mourn and has control over grief in a sad situation... and whose heart does not go through emotional turmoil... that person is a wise person. \nYamadharma Raja (the God of Death) says...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkaschith dhi:raha prathyaga:thma:namichchath\na:vriththa chakshuhu amruthathvamichan\nSLOKA MEANING -\nA wise person, a:vruththa chakshuhu (one with clear vision), who attains good knowledge, who recognizes reality, does not mourn when realizing atma (soul) truth.\n-----------------------------------------------\n“So, you should not grieve over the duty you need to abide by. You can go ahead and bravely wage war.” Sri Krishna thus encourages Arjuna to fight. Sri Krishna enlightens him on soul (atma) truth analysis and clarifies that body and soul are not the same (deha:atma bhranti nirmulana).\nThis is explained in Bhagavad Gita 2.13. Let’s move ahead to understand further as He explains in detail. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Every person wishes to be free of any grief or sadness, for all sorrows to vanish. Who doesn’t wish for this? Everyone does. However, we dislike doing what is necessary to reach this state. We want the grief to go away, but what must be done for the same?\nIn chapter 2, sloka 14 of Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna explained a beautiful means for the same. He [Sri Krishna] named it as thithiksha (forbearance), meaning tolerating something. Once we get used to tolerating things, we will not have distress. Because we do not know how to do so, and we are not able to, we face many troubles. In fact, grief occurs not when we face hardships. It is due to impatience.\nWhen do we have patience? When we like something, we have patience. When we dislike something, we lose patience and the result is grief. When we are with friends or someone we like, we even enjoy walking on stones. Don’t the stones hurt? Don’t they cause pain? Aren’t they rough on skin? Yes, they are. But when we like the company we have, the tolerance towards the pain in the foot increases. Since we have tolerance, we end up liking it. Tolerance is known as thithiksha.\nThe truth is that this thithiksha empowers us to graciously face any external troubles. When do we attain such a state? We attain it when we realize our true nature. The importance of thithiksha is narrated by Sri Krishna in sloka 14.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nma:thra:sparsa:s thu kounthe:yasi:tho:shna sukha dukkhada:ha \na:gama:pa:yinaha anithya:ha tha:n thithikshaswa bha:ratha!\nSLOKA MEANING -\nO son of Kunti (Arjuna), the contact of the senses with their objects gives rise to cold and heat, pleasure and pain, which are temporary. Therefore, O Bharata (Arjuna), endure them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna, the link between this body and you is through the sense organs. The body consists of sense organs, the heart, etc. You are inside the body and they [sense organs] establish the link between you and your body. In reality, Arjuna was sad because he had to fight against his kin standing in front of him. They were committing sins, and they needed to be stopped. He had the right and the capability to rule but incapable people were ruling, and they needed to be stopped. They could neither be stopped through discussion nor through fear. Hence, the last and final call was to punish them by waging war. Now, with war, they should be controlled and sent away. But they are all his kin. He wondered [how is it appropriate] to kill his kin.\nHe [Sri Krishna] said, These relationships exist because of the body. Whatever you do, it [the body] will not last forever. The person you are crying for is actually the in-dwelling soul. So the root cause of your grief is that in-dwelling soul. The soul is always present somewhere, so why do you cry? He said this in the previous verse.\nYou said the soul is eternal but the body is not, which sounds good, Swamy! However, I lose the relationship I previously had with that body when the soul leaves, right? The body no longer exists, right? Now when I use my arrows and kill them in the war, the soul is gone as is the body. I will not see the body again anymore, right? I will also lose the relationship with the body, right? You said he will reside in another body, but I will not be able to identify that body, right? We were together all this time, singing, dancing, and sharing moments with these people. All the resulting happiness is no more from today, right? This is what we call dhukham (grief), caused when we are away from the people we like.\nThe body was with you until now with a certain relation. However, now that is gone. Then how will I not be sad? How will I not grieve? This is Arjuna’s argument. Sri Krishna never said that you will not have any grief. Grieving is normal, but one must know what must be done to tolerate it. The truth is that grief is common due to temporary separation. We will be able to tolerate that pain when we know what its true nature is.\nBut how? Firstly, one must know that nothing gets destroyed. We see this body and we say that the body is no more. The body loses its form but its components are not destroyed. The body is made of five elements, right? We describe it as pancha bhu:tha:thmakam (made of five elements). These five elements took back their natural form and the soul leaves [the body] on its way. Meaning, the body is no more but the soul is happy and has entered another body. \n[It’s commonly thought] When he was in this body, he would have faced many troubles and now he might be happy in another body - we don’t know that! So, what happened now? He is not with you anymore, so you are sad for your own selfish reason. You are not able to think that he might be content there, and be happy for him. You cry that he is not with you anymore. But he has been suffering, right? So you must be happy for his liberation, right? Why are you bothered when he is happy in another body? This is because of the affection you have for him. It is true that your love for him makes you sad due to that separation.\nWhat are you achieving with your grief? When you achieve something out of your grief, it makes sense. When mom makes snacks, the kid asks for them, and she obliges. Then he asks for more, but she does not give. So, the kid starts crying, and she finally gives in. This means crying was fruitful for him. A father brings toys for a kid. When the kid starts playing with them and neglecting his studies, the father hides them. The kid starts crying continuously, asking for the toys. The father gives them again to alleviate the kid’s crankiness. So, his crying was fruitful.\nWhen he cries, he is able to get something out of it. However, when you transition into old age from youth, and you cry saying I want my youth back, will you get it? No. Similarly, once the soul leaves the body and enters another, and you say I want him back, will you get him back? No. Because he entered another body for his purpose. Whatever form the body was in, it loses it and unites with nature. That is, mud [portion of the body] combines with mud. Water [portion of the body] combines with water. Air [portion of the body] combines with air. Fire [portion of the body] combines with fire. Space [portion of the body] combines with space. They all take their natural form. They all reach the original place from where they came from to form the body.\nOnce the purpose of the body is achieved, they all return back to their natural state. The elements of the body took their natural form and the soul took its own path. He was with you until now because of his karma (the effect of past actions). Now that the karma was experienced, he left [the current body]. Why should you cry? Did you bring him back? Or can you stop him? Will he stop for you if you cry? No. Your grief does not stop anything. Will he come back to the same body? No, he will not, for goodness sake! [sarcastically], In case he came back, it would be scary.\nAfter death, if the deceased pities your grieving state, and comes back to the same body, once everything is ready for last rites and this person sits up, everyone will be terrified and run off. No one will remain there. As soon as the person gets up, people will check if he is human or a ghost and see what he is up to, but he will not be treated the same. A boy named Nachiketas went to Yama Dharma Raja (the God of Death) for some reason. His father sent him in anger. Yama Dharma Raja gave him a boon and sent him back. Then the boy prayed to Yama Dharma Raja - “I will go back but my father should not think of me as a ghost.” \nsukhagam seitha: he should sleep beside me and stay happy with me like always. He should not think about who I am and what I was up to. Give me a boon that once I return, he should not be scared of me. Usually after death, no one comes back. Rarely, someone declared dead early will ‘return’, that’s a different story. Normally, it does not happen. True. Then why don’t we stop people from dying? You are asking me to wage war. You are asking me to send them [the souls] into other bodies. Instead, why don’t we stop doing all this? Arjuna asked, intending to stop this war somehow and escape from his duty.\nSri Krishna answered Arjuna that even if he does not send them, they will not stop. Even if you do not fight this war, or leave them like this, they will not stay in these bodies permanently. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nma:ndha:tha: samahi:pathi krutha yuga: lanka:ra bhu:taha gathaha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne King ruled for thousands of years - another for crores of years! Neither of them exist now.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou are talking about Kauravas, right? They also must die. Why? Because the day they abducted Draupadi, the day they tried to insult her, that day itself I decided… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndhwastha: bhavanthu: dharthara:straha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nLet the sons of Dhritarashtra (the Kauravas) be destroyed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe said this after reaching the 2nd shatkam (set of 6 chapters). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmaye: vaithe: nyahatha:ha: purvameva:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI already sent them on their way that day itself.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBut they are here now, right? They are like dhagdhapatams (folded burnt clothes), folded burnt clothes. When you see a folded burnt cloth, it looks exactly like a new cloth with the same folding. However, when you touch it, it simply disintegrates. The entire army standing here is dhagdhapatalas (folded burnt clothes). Because you are my kin and so that you can earn some respect, I want you to earn some respect and thus making you fight, Arjuna. Otherwise, they were destroyed the same day by Me. Do not think that not fighting this war will save them. They all will turn into ashes simply with a light breeze. Before that happens, fight this war so that you fulfill your duty. This way, you will achieve dhushta sikshana (punishing evil) and sishta rakshana (protecting good). By fulfilling your duty, you will prove to others how to perform that duty [despite many challenges]. You will gain great fame. I will be happy if you become famous because you are My person. That is the reason I chose you, says Swamy (Sri Krishna).\nThat is why we need to inculcate thithiksha (forbearance), for we should not think that grief is avoidable. Yes! We grieve due to ishtajana viyoagam (separation from loved ones). Even for ishtavasthu viyogam (losing some object we like a lot), we grieve. Yet, we tolerate and bear this pain. Sri Krishna named this forbearance as thithiksha. In 14th sloka, Sri Krishna says:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntha:n thithikshaswa bha:ratha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, O Bharata (Arjuna), endure them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nTo achieve thithiksha, He describes our relationship with the sense organs called ma:thra:sparsas (contact of the senses). We will learn this further in detail. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Since time immemorial, mankind has become accustomed to depending on relationships to lead life. Animals do not have such relations. Birds too do not have such relations. Other species likely do not have such relations either. However, only for human beings, relations are formed as a big ‘network’. For other animal species, the only reason a bond is created is to reproduce! The male and female mate and stay bonded until the offspring is born. When they raise the offspring to an independent state, they separate. \nevariki va:re: yamuna: thi:re (they live on their own paths) \nThis is how every other species lives. Generally, hens move around with their chicks. The mother hen takes the responsibility of guarding its chicks only until they become independent. Afterwards, the chick and the mother hen part ways. All species act in the same way. However, humans are the only ones that have a big network of children, parents, maternal relatives, paternal relatives, children’s relatives, and other extended relatives. No other species has such a setup. The actual reason for this is to enable a structured social lifestyle for mankind. One must utilize the bonds to conduct good practices. Good conduct is known as dharma. One needs encouragement when practicing dharma. Hence, relatives should be the ones who encourage practicing dharma. They should not be in a state of encouraging bad practices. If relations support such a good cause, then there is no problem with them. Relations can then be regarded as a good thing. \nEven in such cases, people face difficult times having to depart from what they like and to associate with what they dislike. That is why a human being needs o:rimi (endurance). Sri Krishna named this endurance as thithi:ksha (endurance) in Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2, verse 14. \nWhat do they do, the relations of the body? All relations resulting from the body are called bhu:tha bhowthika (physical) relations. The body is made of pancha bhu:thas (five elements of nature). The others that are made of the same pancha bhu:thas are called bhowthikas, formed due to the relation with the body. They are nothing but other bodies. There are links between them such as brother, sister, aunt, uncle, nephew, and other relations. What causes these bhu:tha bhowthika relations? They are formed due to the bond with pancha bhu:thas. They are not formed directly by pancha bhu:thas. They are formed via su:ksha amsas (subtle forms), micro forms of pancha bhu:thas. The micro forms are called thanma:thra-s or ma:thra-s. It’s okay to use either name. \nSri Krishna says in verse 14 of chapter 2…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nma:thra:sparsa:s thu kaunthe:ya!\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe touch of the senses, O son of Kunti!\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe experience the touch of ma:thras (senses). The touch of these ma:thras gives sorrow and joy. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsi:tho:shna sukha duhkhada:ha|\nSLOKA MEANING -\nCold and heat, pleasure and pain.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe sensation of si:tha (cold) gives sorrow in winter and joy in summer. The touch of something cold in summer and touch of something hot in winter gives joy. The touch of something cold in winter and touch of something hot in summer gives some pain. Sometimes, they may not be favorable in those seasons. Si:tha and ushna (heat) become the cause of joy and pain. What causes them? \nma:thra sparsa:ha (the touch of the senses) \nThey are caused by ma:thra sparsa:, i.e., due to the touch of the pancha bhu:thas. A seed gives rise to a tree, right? Let’s say that the seed is a ma:thra sparsa to the tree. So, ma:thra sparsas are those micro forms of pancha bhu:thas that have the ability to give birth to many like them. \nSa:sthra (scripture) says that the soul travels with a su:kshma sari:ra (subtle body). Even when he exists in his body, he has su:kshma sari:ra, the subtle body. As long as he is in su:kshma sari:ra, the respective bhu:thas respond to it. When he exits from the body, termed as de:ha:nthara pra:pthi (leaving the body) we discussed earlier, he leaves with the su:kshma sari:ra. The su:kshma sari:ra records actions as they are. \nWhat does the su:kshma sari:ra have? What is it made of? There are five indriya:s (senses), sensory organs. The sensory receptor for sound is sravane:ndriya. The sensory receptor for touch is thwagindriya. The sensory receptor for form (sight) is chakshurindriya. The sensory receptor for taste is rasane:ndriya. The sensory receptor for smell is ghra:ne:ndriya. There are thus five sense organs. There is also manas (mind) along with them, the controller of all these five sense organs, so they do not act independently. There are five su:kshma amsas (subtle forms) of pancha bhu:thas that hold all these. All these five exist as a small capsule. Ji:va (soul) resides in this capsule. This capsule goes out from one body to another; ji:va travels along with them everywhere he goes. \nSri Krishna explains this in chapter 15. The su:kshma sari:ra has pancha bhu:tha thanma:thras. This one alone is enough to give birth to crores (millions) of the same type. Take a bean seed. The seed is very small. If we cultivate it with care, it gives birth to many beans. Each one has 5 or 6 seeds. If we sow one bean seed, it gives birth to lakhs (hundreds of thousands) of seeds. Every seed has the power and ability to emerge as a tree, isn’t it? If we carefully sow the seeds, the entire earth can be covered with a bean plantation. One seed! \nTake one seed from the plant that the seed grew into. It also has the same potential. Isn’t it fantastic? We don’t know the origin of the first seed, how many lakhs of other seeds it has traversed through! We don’t know how many lakhs of years it has traveled or how many more lakhs it will travel. However, it has completeness – potency. The seed has it. It can therefore also be named as ma:thra:, thanma:thra:. Similarly, the su:kshma sari:ra holding the ji:va made of five pancha bhu:tha thanma:thras… \nSound thanma:thra (subtle form of sound) \nTouch thanma:thra (subtle form of touch) \nForm thanma:thra (subtle form of sight) \nTaste thanma:thra (subtle form of taste) \nSmell thanma:thra (subtle form of smell) \nThe su:kshma sari:ra composed of these five thanma:thras holds the ji:va. It moves the ji:va from one body to another. Ji:va does not have a direct relation with any bhu:tha (element). Ji:va directly does not touch the soil, does not smell it. However, he experiences the qualities of the bhu:tha through the bhu:tha’s thanma:thra, the respective sensory receptor. The thanma:thra is like a bridge. If the bridge is in good condition, it experiences the bhu:tha - either favorable or unfavorable. A favorable experience results in joy. An unfavorable experience results in pain. \nsi:tha - ushna - sukha - dukhada:ha (cold, heat, pleasure, pain) \nma:thra sparsa:ha (the touch of the senses) \nThe ji:va’s connection to the gross body is through the ma:thras and then through the senses. If we can carefully control the ma:thra sparsas, the resident ji:va wouldn’t even need to know what is happening to the gross body. This su:kshma sari:ra stays with the ji:va for longer. All connections that are formed through the gross body are temporary. They come and go. They sometimes give joy and pain. \na:gama apa:yinaha (come and go) \nanithya:ha (not eternal) \nThere is no rule that what comes stays eternally or what goes never returns. Or nithya (eternal), i.e., the business or activity of something coming closer and going farther is eternal. Therefore, it can be said in two ways… \na:gama:pa:yino: nithya:ha (the coming and going is eternal) \na:gama:pa:yinaha anithya:ha (the experiences are not eternal) \nThere is no rule that the experiences resulting from them stay the same, therefore anithyaha. Their business of coming closer and going farther from an experience will always be there, therefore nithya:ha. What do we do in such cases? Bear it. There is heat from the sun. What are you doing then? What can we do - Summer! There will be heat. We use an electric fan, or a hand fan, or turn on the AC and tolerate it. It’s raining. What do you do? Bear it. Because it’s not going to rain forever. It pours for a while and ceases later. \nThere are floods that washed away cars and more. What do we do? We cannot keep crying about it. What do we do in a storm? You try to tolerate it, taking shelter on a second or third floor, unsure and nervous. You wait until it subsides. If the building doesn’t collapse before then, you come down and begin your daily routine. What if the weather returns the next day? You should deal with it then. Therefore, there is always the process of something coming and going. There is no rule that something stays forever. \na:gama:pa:yinaha anithya:ha (the coming and going is not eternal) \nWe tolerate it when we encounter it. The attitude is termed thithi:ksha (endurance). Thithi:ksha is very essential. He (Sri Krishna) did not speak of this in the beginning. Why? Because one can understand what thithi:ksha is and its importance only when one realizes that ji:va is different from the body. Therefore, He now speaks of thithi:ksha after attaining that knowledge. \nAre we restraining ourselves from anything because there’s rain or heat? Are we stopping eating? Are we stopping breathing in and out? So, don’t stop anything else! Don’t stop performing your duties because there is something painful or joyful on the way. It should not become an excuse for picking up or letting go of your dharma (defined duty). Whether you do your work or stop should not be based on it. You should keep doing what you need to. Occurrences will keep coming and going. \nYou make a friend while traveling by train. He is very sweet with you. When the train arrives at his station, he will get down. You will get down at your stop. The flight crew in a passenger aircraft shows their respect and concern for you, “Good morning sir, what can I do for you sir?” However, that’s only until you disembark. Once you are off the plane, both parties go their own independent ways. What are you doing in such a case? Are you planning to spend your lifetime with them because they were so good with you on the plane? No. \nTherefore, they (relations) are all like companions on a train or plane journey, or friends you encounter in a theatre, or on the road. Like the waves in the ocean, their movement (back and forth) is eternal. Similarly, relations are the same way. \ntha:n thithikshasva (tolerating them is always the right thing to do) \nTheir entry and exit in life cannot determine your dharma. You cannot ever stop exercising your dharma. The experiences, relations, bonds, and resulting pains and joys, should never become means of separating you from dharma. Therefore, Arjuna, you cannot turn your back on your duty. You must follow through. \ntha:n thithikshasva bha:ratha (learn to tolerate) \nSri Krishna explains how essential it is to exercise one’s duty. He details the pre-requisite, i.e., how one must have endurance. He clarifies these in Bhagavad Gita chapter 2, verse 14 and continues onward. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a scripture which has emerged to teach the ideal lifestyle to humans. This is the ‘theory’. Sri Ramayana is the ‘practical’. It [Bhagavad Gita] is followed and practiced there [in Ramayana]. The practice is recorded and offered to us as Bhagavad Gita. There [in Ramayana], Sage Valmiki described the way to practice. Sage Vyasa assembled it as Sri Krishna’s upadesa (teaching) called Bhagavad Gita in Mahabharata. We should listen to Ramayana to follow it. We should listen to Bhagavad Gita for knowledge. One gives knowledge, and another demonstrates practicing it. They are analogous to two eyes of a human. They must both have the same goal. There are two eyes. However, if they see two different things, a doctor should be consulted. Even though there are two eyes, the visible entity must be the same. Similarly, we should know that both Ramayana and Bharata make one wonderful literature instructing on [a single objective] ideal lifestyle.\nSwami speaks about thithiksha (endurance) in Bhagavad Gita chapter 2, verse 14. Thithiksha means endurance or having patience. Thithiksha energizes one to carry on with one’s work. It teaches one how to carefully understand and withstand any issues when working. Sastra (one that instructs, the Vedas) states in smruthi scriptures…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna jathu kamath na bhayath na lobhath dharmam thyajeth\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne must not give up duties because of increased desires, fear, or worry about losing something.\n-----------------------------------------------\nji:vithasya:pi he:tho:ho (even if one is losing life), one must not give up one’s duties. Desires, fear, greed, or situations leading to loss of life all pertain to the body. Because of attachment to bodies, we become ready to even sacrifice responsibilities to ensure the body is not in pain. That should not be the case. One should never give up exercising duties under any condition. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna thyajeth\nSLOKA MEANING -\nCannot be given up.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is the order of the smruthi, part of the Vedas. What must we do when such a situation arises? Remember that such situations are all pertaining to deha (body). Your dharma (duty) is to perform duties that enable you to attain a higher state by getting rid of acquired karma. The body is given as a tool for that purpose, but it is not a permanent resource. Thus, even if it requires hurting it, you must exercise your duties. However, we generally do not hesitate to give up our responsibilities if they put the body in pain. Sri Krishna is advising Arjuna to get accustomed to thithiksha (endurance). One should learn to withstand and move ahead in life.\nIn fact, why should I do all these? To attain what? Let’s say I tolerate everything and move ahead. You are saying it’s not necessary to be worried or tolerate grief. What do I get out of all that endurance? Is there any experienceable physical benefit? No, it’s the grief that I experience and will be left with. I will be put in the difficult situation of having lost relatives. I will be left with having done all the hard work. This is the direct physical consequence of the war; it is loss and grief. Nothing else. Are you telling me that there is some indirect benefit of this? I am going to be killing Drona and Bhishma, my ‘gurus’. I will only accrue sin for doing such a thing. Hence, there is neither direct benefit nor indirect benefit. Also, is it mandatory that I do this? I can simply skip this and go away and stay in the forest. Is it also mandatory that I tolerate the pain or loss? It is not necessary, right? If we all go to the forests and somehow make a living, they will all go to the kingdom happily. There is no need to fight. Everyone can live happily, right? There won’t be any suffering. \n“Tell me what is the special benefit for tolerating [the result of this war]?” asked Arjuna. Sri Krishna gives the answer in chapter 2, verse 15.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyam hi na vyatthayanthy e:the: purusham purusharshabha!\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever can accustom themselves to be tolerant…\n-----------------------------------------------\nsama duhkha sukkham dhi:ram so::mruthaththva:ya kalpathe: (whoever accepts happiness and sorrow equally) will attain amruthaththvam (an ever-lasting boon). So, where is tolerance? Is o:rimi (tolerance) something that should be exercised in the body or in the manas (mind)? It is in the manas. The body will respond to situations. Earlier, He [Sri Krishna] said that matra sparsas (sense perceptions) cause joy and sorrow, cold and heat, etc. How can we behave like a statue, not reacting or responding to those? Is it possible? If someone touches a hot substance, isn’t there an instant reaction in the body to the heat? If you touch a deep frozen item, doesn’t it give you the chills? If one doesn’t experience ice or fire, can we think of the person as someone alive? He is not in the body; he has left the body. A dead body can therefore be placed in an ice box or burnt. It doesn’t respond. Do we praise ‘him’ for having tolerance? It just means he is no longer in the body. \nSo, [Sri Krishna] what are you asking me to become by exclaiming thithiksha?! Are you saying that I reach that state [leaving the body dead]? No! The responses to touching fire or ice are changes in the body. You don’t need to be affected because of them. This is what Sri Krishna is saying. ‘You’ implies the jiva (soul). Jiva has a responsibility. The responsibility must be exercised using senses throughout the body. This must not change. He says that you must carry them out (responsibilities). \nAnyway, what do I gain out of performing these duties, giving up happiness? This is Arjuna’s question. He is trying to get out of war. Arjuna’s heart is probably consumed with desire to skip his responsibility. “What do I gain by doing this?” asks Arjuna! Swami [Sri Krishna] is answering this. Whoever is accustomed to tolerance will attain amruthaththvam, an eternal gain. He is declaring this. One who is tolerant will attain amruthaththvam. When?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsama duhkha sukkham dhi:ram\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever welcomes anything coming his way will certainly attain amruthaththvam.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is what Swami [Sri Krishna] is explaining. What it means is that one is sad for having to stay away from something only when he has taste for the happiness it gives. Let’s say an officer has deputed you to a place on a task. Why did he go to the place? Not to enjoy the beauty of the place but to work on the designated task. He needs to focus only on the task if that is the purpose. While he is working on the task, he may come across the beauty of the place, such as waterfalls, etc., relishing the beauty. That’s fine. Will he cry when he is having to leave the place because it is so beautiful? Did he go to the place for that purpose? No, right? He went on a duty as part of his job. When he understands that the travel to the place is due to his job, he will relish the beauty of the place while he is there. However, there is no need for him to cry over missing it when he must return. The entire labor force is working this way, isn’t it? \nTherefore, your focus should be on ‘why’ you are there and not on ‘what’ is there. You got the deha (body) for exercising your dharma and experiencing karma. What is important is to exercise dharma, not the relations and the resulting happiness and sorrows. If from day one you are not focused on them, they will not give you happiness, sorrow, pleasure, pain, etc. You will be able to realize that whatever you are facing is for your sreya (benefit). You will be able to experience pleasure and pain. You will be able to tolerate them in whatever way they are. It means that you will not be affected when they are with you or not. You will be able to perceive them equally, sama drusti (equal vision). Because you are focused on your duty. If you are not focused on your duty, you will notice [and feel affected by] them. Your duty is to practice dharma, make sure it is practiced by others, and to remove any hurdles on the way to it. \nTherefore, a wise person is one who receives sorrow equally as joy in the process of performing prescribed duties. A soldier in the army of a country is on duty to protect his nation. Therefore, he will not care about the temporary pains and pleasures of climbing trees, walking on snow, or swimming through rivers. He will move ahead with focus on protecting his nation. Thus, he gets joy. Didn’t he experience any pain when crawling, climbing, or crossing? He did. However, he tolerated them. This is what Kunthi Devi prayed for Sri Krishna. For what? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvipadaha santhunaha sasvath thathrathathra jagath guro:h\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou are leaving us as soon as happy times are here.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou were with us in the difficult times protecting us all throughout – like an eyelid to the eye. Today, when these difficult times have come to an end, you are saying ‘aunt, I will take leave now.’ Our goal is to be with you; it doesn’t matter if things are difficult or easy to handle. If difficult times are the only means to be with You, then let us always have the difficult times. Sri Mad Bhagavatam describes this prayer of Kunthi Devi. Therefore, you must accept sorrow at the appropriate time. When in a state of pleasure, don’t think of it as permanent. What it means is that you must happily accept and experience sorrow. A dhira (wise person) is one who habituates himself with this, with that thithiksha. Such a person becomes eligible for amruthathvam (eternally lasting bliss). Others will not attain amruthathvam. Sri Krishna declares and clarifies this to Arjuna in chapter 2, verse 15 of Bhagavad Gita.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsama duhkha sukkham dhi:ram\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever accepts happiness and sorrow equally will attain amruthaththvam.\n-----------------------------------------------\nLet’s continue further to understand in more clarity. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2, verse 15 defines and declares who a dhi:ra (wise person) is. \nsama duhkha sukkham dhi:ram\nA dhi:ra experiences joy or sorrow with equanimity. What does it mean to feel joy or sorrow with equanimity? He who gets excited in times of joy or depressed in times of sorrow, giving in to various emotions, is not a dhi:ra. A dhi:ra is one who can tolerate anything. He is not a person without any joy or sorrow. There will be joys and sorrows. Why? Because life is like a journey, a voyage. There are going to be tides in the water as we sail through. There are high and low tides. Do we cry over the tides? We prepare ourselves with ways to navigate through them. Similarly, there are going to be joys and sorrows in life. It is also essential to face them. If one has endurance (thithiksha) or tolerance (sahanam) when facing them, then the effect of joys and sorrows will not distract him from his responsibilities. Therefore, thithiksha is a means to move one ahead in performing his duties.\nAs a human being, one must not give up responsibilities in his/her life. However, many people do not think this way. As soon as one is happy, he begins to think that it’s all because of him, there is no one as great as him. He exhibits a pompous and arrogant nature, singing and dancing everywhere. When slightly unhappy, he feels worried and depressed. In times of joy, people feel it’s their achievement. In times of sorrow, they feel God is not compassionate. “Even though I am a devotee, I am facing all these difficult times.” They try to blame it on Him because it costs nothing to do so! If so, why not adore His compassion in times of joy? If not, he must believe that the difficult times are a result of bad things or thoughts he committed. No! He feels that joys are a result of his work, whereas he feels that sorrows are a result of His (God’s) actions. He thinks of himself as a pure person. Therefore, he tries to blame everything on Him saying, “God is not compassionate, He does not know anything, He is not merciful, not kind, He is not taking care of me, He is ignoring me.” Thus, people try to blame everything on God. This is not appropriate. Thinking that God is jealous of him, etc. is not good.\nSorrows can be a result of anyone or anything, such as nature. There could be natural calamities like cyclones, storms, earthquakes, hurricanes, extreme heat or cold. It could be that a year is great for crops and another year isn’t. Giving credit to yourself when there is good yield or blaming Him for being uncompassionate for giving difficult times, therefore, we will leave this God. Such a thought process is not right. If you want to give credit to yourself, do it for both joys and sorrows. Welcome sorrow and joy in the same way. Or leave joy with God like you do in case of sorrow. Don’t hold it on yourself. However, one for you and another for Him?! All the credit for you and blame for Him?! This kind of state is not good for you. This is when thithiksha, endurance becomes useful. Being able to believe that both (joys and sorrows) are given by Him.\nElectricity comes on and goes. The government may pledge enabling constant power to the public. The public knows and experiences the actual state of it. Are we crying out for having no current? We set up an inverter, battery, or something else and continue with our work. We are not quitting our work. We plan for ways to handle any crisis but do not run away from performing our duties. Even in such cases, we eat, we breathe, we bathe and perform sandhya vandana (prayer to the indwelling power of the Sun), we put on clothes, we do everything then, and now. We are not quitting these activities. So, don’t compromise in all other duties. This is called amruthaththvam (an eternal state). Endurance is the key prerequisite for it. Thithiksha! Endurance. Whoever has thithiksha, he attains amruthaththvam. If one can tolerate sorrow, that itself is a great quality. If he doesn’t cry over something, that itself is a great skill to have!\nHe (God) gives us whatever is necessary at the essential times. When one attains this knowledge, it implies that the body has become a good tool for one’s enrichment. The more understanding of this knowledge, the better one becomes. Thithiksha, endurance or patience, is not a visible characteristic. Muscles in a body are visible when one is strong. Bones are visible in a body that is weak and lean. These are all visible aspects. However, the qualities being practiced by a man are not visible characteristics. Thithiksha is also not a visible quality. It is an internal quality. In fact, endurance is a key element in Bharat’s (India’s) culture. It is a great virtue to practice. If one has this, amruthaththva is an automatic result. The more firm this knowledge, the greater the endurance. As endurance grows, the amruthaththva one experiences becomes richer. The prerequisite for amruthaththva is a sorrow-free state.\nBhagavad Gita is theory - practice can be seen in Ramayana. Because Sri Ramayana is regarded as its practical scripture guide. This Bhagavad Gita is a record of all the laws of life. That Ramayana demonstrates the practice. It can be seen in Rama and Bharata. It is demonstrated via many instances, but clear and direct with Sri Rama. Sri Rama’s father calls and informs Him that Rama will be crowned the next day. He heard it and was happy. The next morning, father calls and informs Sri Rama that he will be exiled for 14 years to the forests. What would anyone else have done? Anyone else in his place would have either cried out loud or taken his life. Or would have gathered his army, fought the one who broke the promise and conquered the kingdom. He would do something of this sort. However, Rama did not do that. Father instructed Him to take the throne. What is important is that it was an instruction from the father, not the instruction itself! Rama accepted when asked to take the king’s throne. The very next day, He accepted when asked to leave the kingdom and go to the forests. He accepted the latter instruction in the same way he accepted the former order.\nra:jyam va: vanava:so va:\nWhen His stepmother asked, He said, “No hesitation to go to the forests - if the instruction is from father, it’s my duty to follow.” If he asks me to take the throne, I will take it. If he asks me to go to the forests, I will go. What’s the necessity for me to think differently from his instruction? Following his orders is my duty. He felt that it was his goal in life. He decided this in his manas (heart) and therefore, all consequences were fine with him. If his manas does not like it, it would have all been difficult. That’s why He said…\nra:jyam va vanava:so va:\nIt does not matter if it is in the kingdom or in the forests. However, going to the forests is great for me because you ordered me to do so. That is better for me. Therefore, I must go. Once we decide in the heart about something, then there won’t be any problem following it. Assume you are waiting for a car ride. No sign of it. You conclude that it won’t arrive. What do you do? You will begin walking with disappointment, wishing that you had the car. Why? Because there was a hope to travel by car and it did not happen - it put you in tears. Assume one was not even waiting for a car, one would have been fine walking. His experience would be pleasant.\nWe went to Muktinath in the Himalayas where Salagrama (sacred stones worshipped as the form of God) are accessible. Everyone prepared themselves to travel by foot. Everyone enjoyed the journey. There were camps in between and it was a beautiful experience. The next time we went, there was an airplane available. Some got in it, the rest had to walk. The people who walked felt it painful. They asked us to see if there is any way an additional airplane can be sourced. They said they couldn’t walk. There was no airplane the first time we went. Hence, everyone just walked and enjoyed the path. The walk was difficult then and now! However, they all enjoyed the difficult situation then. The second time, they ‘felt’ that they lost the chance of journeying by plane. Therefore, they walked every step with difficulty.\n“It was father’s order that I [Sri Rama] go to the forests for 14 years. Hence, it’s my future.” He decided so in His mind. When Hanuman asks, Mother Sita introduces Herself and explains Her story to him while sitting under the tree. She says that Rama first decided in His heart to go to the forests…\nmanasa: gruhya:\nLater, He expressed the same in words. He first accepted it in his manas (heart). Therefore, everything He did in this regard gave him happiness. Manas, the heart! Thithiksha, endurance or sahanam (patience) is built in the heart. That is why He could say…\nra:jyam va: vanava:so va:\n“Mother, no matter whether it’s the kingdom or forests, both belong to my father. I am under his umbrella wherever I am.” \nikshwa:ku:nam iyam bhu:mihi\nThe whole earth is in father’s lineage. Therefore, it belongs to my father. Wherever I am in my father’s abode, it’s the same. If you feel the entire home is yours, it doesn't matter where you are in the house – the entrance, the exit, inside! Wherever I am, I am in the house. No matter where I am, I am exercising his order. There is no question about staying in the forests being difficult and staying in the kingdom being joyous. Both are places of happiness. Father ordered me to go and stay in the forests. Therefore, staying in forests is now a more pleasant place.\nvanava:so maho:daya\nHe accepted it to be the time that gives Him better opportunities. Otherwise, wouldn’t one have cried out loud [in such a case]? Wouldn’t one pursue legal action in court? Rama did not do any of that. He accepted it happily. This is the ability of the heart to accept, sahana si:latha (ability to endure). Thithiksha! Because Sri Rama has thithiksha, He was happy even when exiled to the forests. Because He went happily, He is heartfully worshiped by everyone till date. He attained amruthaththvam (eternal state). We must remember this. Lakshmana Swami doesn’t have thithiksha. His brother was going, and so he went along. Therefore, he always thought about the kingdom or wondered how Bharata was doing. He would think of such things many times when in the forests. Rama never felt any change in his mental state ever.\nThere are four important verses in Bhagavad Gita [chapter 2] - 12, 13, 14, and 15. Sri Krishna delivered everything that He intended to in these 4 verses. These verses can together be called the chatthuslo:ki (the four verses of Bhagavad Gita). If this set of verses is understood, then the entire upade:sa (teaching) is understood. The rest is all an elaboration to reinforce this knowledge of these verses. The rest is all an upade:sa (teaching) giving various ways to explore and affirm these verses. We must try to practice it carefully, thereby progressing towards amruthaththvam. Let’s move ahead, seeking strength from God to do so. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Like everyone else, devotees also experience happiness and sorrow. They are also human, right? They also have hunger and thirst; happiness and sorrow. Then, what is the difference between them and the others? Everyone else becomes slaves to happiness and sorrow. They get swayed and crushed by happiness and sorrow. Devotees tolerate them and stand firm. Some seekers pray to God to get out of troubles and pains. They desire only happiness. However, devotees never pray that way. They don’t ask for happiness - they don’t pray to Him to take away the sorrows. “I don’t mind if it's happiness or sorrow…”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndivi va: bhuvi va: mama:sthu va:saha\nnarake:va\nSLOKA MEANING -\nregardless if sent to hell\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is Your responsibility to place me where You want and make me do what You want. I am Your tool. It’s up to the owner how to use the tool. You are the owner. I am Your da:sa (servant). Therefore, I am not connected to anything - where You position me, what You do, how, etc. Make this [me] do whatever You want to. However, I am knowledgeable by nature. Hence… First, qualify me so I don’t get arrogant about my inherent knowledge, believing that I am the ultimate doer. Second, qualify me such that I can stand firm despite any happy or difficult situations. Help enhance appropriate feelings in accordance with this.\nIn the world, always… The main object and its dharmas (righteous duties), qualifiers, come into existence. The attributes that define the essential quality of the object are added later. Lakshyam (the object) is formed first. Lakshanas (the attributes) come later. The attributes do not form prior to the object. The objects are formed first. The attributes defining the formed object are made available later. Bhagavad Gita is a lakshana grandha (explanatory scripture), while Sri Ramayana is a lakshya grandha (objective scripture).\nWe can listen to Sri Krishna’s teaching on the importance of thithiksha (endurance) through to chapter 2, verse 15. Thithiksha means patience, or endurance. Endurance is a very important quality. Only those who have endurance will attain amruthaththva (eternal bliss). The lakshya grandha, Ramayana, demonstrates this aspect. There is a great one named Bharatha. He is the key brother of Sri Rama. He is a great, innocent, dharma:thma (proponent of righteousness). Dharma is one’s practice of righteous deeds. Elders’ teachings state that one must not give up on dharma in difficult times. Bharatha is indeed an excellent human being.\nHe spent significant time in his maternal uncle’s house. All four - Rama, Bharatha, Lakshmana, and Shatrugna - were married to Janaka’s daughters in his kingdom. Viswamithra led Rama and Lakshmana there. Dasaratha led the remaining two sons there. All four got married. They returned. After returning, Bharatha went to his maternal uncle’s house. Maybe he had a very good time there; he journeyed there quite often. Thus, he spent 12 years there.\nOne day, a few soldiers reached Bharatha and informed him that his minister, sage Vasishta, had urgently summoned him. Bharatha was not sure what happened. He had bad dreams the previous night. Hence, he guessed that Ayodhya had seen some danger. His heart was in a nervous state. His friends wanted to spend time with him, but he wasn’t in the right mood. They tried to cheer him up, but it did not work. Then came the soldiers with the news, “You are being summoned at once by your minister…” His heart felt something was wrong. He began his journey home with the same feeling. He entered Ayodhya, reaching home. It seemed like a graveyard everywhere! He was used to visiting his father at Mother Kaikeyi’s palace. Hence, he went there directly. It was all looking gloomy and dismal there as well. He quickly reached his mother. She was also not in a welcoming state. He bowed down to her. He asked his mother, “Father always comes to receive me when I return, where is he?” She responded very casually, “He went where anyone born ultimately goes.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsurapathi bhavanam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhat!? Father is no more?! What happened?! How?\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat did he say as he left? He said ‘Rama… Rama…’ as he left. What happened to Rama? Where was Rama? Wasn’t he there next to father? Rama went to the forests. Why? Going to the forests means that he had done something wrong. Did Rama make any mistake? Did he steal anyone’s belongings? Did he steal someone else’s woman? Did he steal something? Why was he sent to the forests? She raised her voice, questioning how he could even think of Rama committing these sins? Then, why did he go to the forests? It was me, I sent him. Why? To give you the kingdom! He felt slapped on the face as he heard that. You sent Ramachandra to the forests so I can have the kingdom?! And that caused father's demise! He crumbled down, shedding tears. She said…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nUththishto:uththishta kim se:she ra:jan\nmaha:yasa:ha!\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou are the king now! Can a king cry?\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen she referred to him as king, he felt crushed further (like red chili powder on a cut wound). He was furious and pulled out his sword. She was the reason for father’s death and Rama’s exile. That too, after having heard that she did it for his sake, he was ready to behead her immediately. He recollected his brother advising him to wait and think. “If I behead you, I will not be able to face Ramachandra.” He thinks of you as his mother and therefore will reprimand me for having killed a mother. You have done such a heinous act. I am letting you go because he thinks of you as his mother. Bharatha is performing all his duties, but with immense grief in the heart. What must he do now? Whose mistake is this? Why did it happen? Someone said, “It was Manthara who came up with this plan and executed it.” Shatrugna saw her. She, being an old woman, stood at the door with a walking stick. Like a monkey, she was wearing a chain around her neck, gifted by Kaika. She stood at the door smiling as if waiting for them. Furious, Shatrugna wanted to behead her with his sword. Bharatha stopped him. \n“Brother, why? Isn’t she the cause for all the nonsense that happened here?” That’s when Bharatha said…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna manthara:ya:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nnot the mistake of Manthara\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhose mistake is it then? Which servant would not want his/her owner to be happy? Which servant would not wish for his/her owner’s son to be the greatest? Her desire, therefore, is not wrong. Probably… However, listening to the advice of such people and acting accordingly to create such havoc, is this mother’s mistake. He said… Therefore, it’s Kaikeyi’s mistake.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna ma:thurasya:ha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nit’s not Mother Kaikeyi’s mistake\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhich mother wouldn’t desire great things for her son? Brother, why do you say that?! So, whose mistake is it? Oh yes, it is the responsibility of the king to take a decision when someone like her advises upon something. However, King Dasaratha was carried away and granted her a boon without thinking or consulting anyone. Therefore, it is the king’s mistake. “It is all Dasaratha’s sin!” Shatrugna said. No no!\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndo:sho: na ra:jhaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nnot the king’s mistake\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf the king himself does not keep his word, then who in the kingdom will abide by their words? Therefore, it is not even the king’s mistake. Whose mistake is it then, Rama’s? How? Father is aged, more than 60,000 old. When someone is old, their ability to think properly may diminish. They may not be the best to make decisions. In that case, shouldn’t a wise one think whether it is right or wrong, good or bad for the public before acting on something? Simply because he ordered it… In fact, the king didn’t even explicitly order him; he simply followed her orders. So, do we say it is Rama’s mistake? No! That's wrong.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna cha ra:ghavasya:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nit is not Rama’s mistake\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf someone like Rama doesn’t act in accordance with his father’s wish, then who in the world will? You’re saying it’s… is... not Manthara’s mistake… not Kaikeyi’s mistake… not Dasaratha’s mistake… not Rama’s mistake… Then, who is responsible for such a horrible situation?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmath pa:pame:va:thra nimiththava:si\nSLOKA MEANING -\nMy sin is the main cause for Rama having to go for exile in the forests.\n-----------------------------------------------\nMy birth here caused such a grave crime like this. This is my fate and hence it resulted in a miserable state for… such thought in her [Manthara] such wish in her [Kaikeyi] such decision by him [Dasaratha] such an act by him [Rama]. Hence, it is no one else’s mistake. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmath pa:pame:va athra nimiththam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is Bharatha’s situation.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThat is, he is taking the responsibility of the difficult situation on himself. He tried to rectify the blame through his actions. He did not cross his dharma because things came upon him. He became a role model to the world for his patience, never turning back or hesitating on performing his duties, despite being put in a happy or sad condition. Devotees always seek this. They don’t say no to troubles. They pray to God to give them the endurance that is required to face the difficult times.\n“Oh come on, wouldn’t everyone push someone around who is simply tolerant of anything? There is a tale to explain this. It seems a snake hissed at a saint. He said, “I didn’t do anything to you, why do you hiss at me? Stop it.” He then left the place. By the time he came back in the evening, the snake was in a dire situation fighting death. Why? The sage said not to hiss and so the snake obeyed. There were kids playing there and he didn’t hiss at them. They played with the snake, pulling, and pushing it here and there! The saint asked, “What happened, you were fine in the morning?” “It is a result of following your advice!” \n“Oh no! I asked not to hiss unnecessarily. I did not restrict you from doing so in self-defense! Therefore, endurance is not about tolerating everything. Tolerate something if it is within the limit of your duty. When not within limit, fight it out. You must push back as necessary. We must understand this. Thithiksha (endurance) is a great tool for humans. It must be used in exercising dharma. We must never give up on our responsibilities, no matter what the circumstance. God explains this. In fact, a thief also has endurance to steal. We are not talking about such endurance in this context. We are talking about the endurance that must be exercised to… carry out responsibilities… for the well-being of others… in practicing dharma, righteous living.\nSri Krishna speaks of endurance in these aspects. If this can be firm and practiced, the resulting activities get sanctified. Bhagavad Gita after these 4 verses is all manana grandha (a guide to reinforce what has been taught in the 4 verses). Chathusslokhi (the 4 verses), are the prime part of this teaching. If one understands these 4 verses, 12 to 15 in chapter 2 of Bhagavad Gita, then one can assume he knows Gita entirely. If you know its essence, then Gita is with you. Not within your body, within your heart. To help reinforce the essence within your heart, the rest of the scripture becomes useful. Let’s learn how to reinforce this as we move ahead. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), we must familiarize ourselves with certain terms when learning Bhagavad Gita. Some are technical. Though technical, it’s important to pay attention. Because these technical terms that a seeker needs to know to aid in understanding Elders (spiritually wise) are different from what’s used in daily life. If we familiarize ourselves with them, when Elders speak, we can get an idea about what they are speaking.\nLet’s take Physics for example. All elements have a unique code. If we are familiar with codes of elements, we will not feel at a loss when people converse about the same. We will at least understand the topic or basics of such conversations. Hence, we are trying to familiarize ourselves with certain terms. Sri Krishna is introducing us to such terms in chapter 2. What are they? In verse 16, the first term is bha:vam (existence), the second term is saththa: (eternal). He uses these two terms in a great systematic manner to explain them. He says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna:satho: vidyathe: bha:vaha\nasathaha bha:vaha na vidyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere is no existence for the temporary; the eternal does not cease to exist.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat does asath (temporary) mean? What does sath (eternal) mean? Sath means that which never changes its form. Asath means that which never remains in the same form. There is nothing in this world that remains in the same form forever. \nna:sathaha vidyathe: bha:vaha\nasathaha\nFor everything visible, this world (i.e., for all that which does not exist in the same form) bha:vaha na vidyathe: (existence does not exist). They always go through transformation. ‘Bha:vam’ means asthiththva (existence), i.e., saththa:. ‘Saththa: is that aspect of activity indicating ‘no dissolution’. \nna:sa prathibandhaka vya:pa:ra vise:shamu\nAsthiththvam is the characteristic of not undergoing dissolution, i.e., always existing. Asthiththva quality cannot apply to anything in this world. Everything goes through changes. \nIn olden days, people would use mountains as landmarks for locating an address. “Take a turn at that hill, Mahendragiri… take a turn there at the Vidhya Mountains, etc.” They probably assumed that mountains are permanently positioned. Nowadays, one cannot assume that. Statues are shaped using stones cut from mountains. Roads are being constructed drilling through mountains. Residential colonies are being constructed, destroying mountains. This country itself has so many metropolitan cities that were once just mountains and hills. We are in times where a mountain [once assumed to be permanent] cannot be located anymore. It also does not ‘exist permanently’. \nChanges form to another. One day it exists as a mountain, then it turns into stone, made into a step, bench, or statue - or simply into a heap of gravel. It may transform into dust and be part of some cement material. It changes into some state. All matter is categorized into a group qualifying for the activity of ‘changing form’. They disintegrate to change from one form to another. It is not possible for it to retain the same form forever. That which changes is termed bha:vamu (temporary existence).\nna:satho: vidyathe: bha:vaha\nasathaha bha:vaha na\nThis world cannot have existence in the same form. \nna: bha:vo vidyathe: sathaha\nA:thma (soul), is that which never disintegrates or changes form. Hence, it is named sath (eternal). That sath does not have abha:vaha (absence of existence). It never changes form. \nThis is not something new for you or me to declare. \nubhayo:rapi anthaha drustaha\nThe wise have seen the conclusive crux of both. \n’Antham’ means decision. When discussions take place to conclude something, it implies that it hasn’t reached antham (decision), a conclusion. If the essential aspects of something are clear and decided, it implies that the discussion is completed. When? When the decision is reached, then it is marked complete. Antham is the decision about the object. \nVe:da:ntham also means the same. Ve:da + antham refers to those parts which clearly present the conclusions of the Ve:da (knowledge). Similarly, the decision on the thaththvas (truths)…\nanthaha ubhayo:rapi \nanthaha drustaha\nThe antham, conclusions about the sentient and non-sentient entities are already known. The conclusions were already decided. By whom? \nanayo:ho\nFor these both. Who decided? \nthaththva darsibhihi\nWho are the thaththva darsis (those who see the truth), the great ones? The jna:nis (wise ones) like Para:sara maharshi, Vya:sa… Elders of all sampradayas (traditions) unquestionably accept Maharshi Para:sara to be the prama:na (means of knowledge). Hence, it is said that no one can deny the conclusions declared by Para:sara. He decided and declared. \nWhat did he say? He says in Vishnu Pura:na…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:th na vijna:nam ruthe:sth kinchith kwachith kada:chith dwija vasthuja:tham\nsadbha:va e:vam bhavatho: mayo:kthaha jna:nam yadha sathyam asathyamanyath\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, apart from knowledge, there is nothing anywhere, and that which has existence is knowledge, while the rest is non-knowledge.\n-----------------------------------------------\nOne has the swabha:va (nature) called sath. Another has the bha:vam (nature of existence), always changing, asath. What are they? One is jna:na (knowledge). Another is jna:na su:nya (absence of knowledge), achith (non-sentient) - the matter. All this visible matter is non-sentient. It does not have any aspect of knowledge. \nthasma:th vijna:na mruthe:\nThe knowledge possessing state of ji:va (soul) is asthi (exists). However, in this visible matter – it is na: asthi (not existing). \nkinchith kwachith kada:chith…\nAnything, anytime, anywhere… \n…sadbha:vamu does not exist in this world. We discussed the meaning of sadbha:vamu earlier. Sath means ‘unaltering’; bha:vamu means ‘existence’. The unaltering existence does not exist [for matter]. The sabha:vam does not exist. I am explaining the same to you. \nHence, knowledge and the thaththva that has knowledge is called sathyam (truth). \nsath thyam\nThat whose nature is sath. Sathyam does not mean truth; asathyam does not mean false. ‘Sath thyam’ is that whose nature is sath. \nanyath asathyam\nThe rest is qualified to be asath (temporary). All this visible matter around is referred to as asath. \nHe explains the same to a King in a different context. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyaththu ka:la:nthare:na:pi na:nyasanya:m upayithi vai\nparina:ma:dhi sambhu:tha:m thadvasthu: nrupa kaschakim\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn the ever-changing Time, what is it that does not change in any way, including name?\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe asks, “In the ever-changing Time, what is it that does not change in any way including name?” He answers saying, “…that which has knowledge, an entity named soul.” Its identity never changes. Its definition does not change. Both its nature and form do not change. He clarified this in Vishnu Pura:nam. Therefore, it is always ana:si (imperishable), parama:rdhascha (eternally remaining as is). \nIt is…\nprajnairapi abhyupa gamyathe:\nAgreed by all the wise. \nthaththu na:si na sande:haha\nThat which changes unquestionably. \nna:si dravyo:pa pa:ditham\nThat which is made from disintegrating substances, also disintegrates. \nMaharshi Para:sara declared this aspect in Vishnu Pura:na. If we inspect these two (soul and body) through the great sage’s [Para:sara’s] declaration… \nanthaha drustavaha thaththva darsibhihi\nThey have already declared a decision on these back then. Therefore, you need not worry about the soul that is ana:si (imperishable) and unaltering in form. You also need not worry about the body, which is asath (temporary), which disintegrates no matter what you do or not do. \nSri Krishna clearly explains this to Arjuna in verse 2.16. He explains it by stating maharshis and ve:da:nthis (those who know the essence of Vedas) as prama:na (means of knowledge). Let’s continue further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), to become a better person, it is always beneficial to walk in the path of Elders (scripturally knowledgeable). Why? We refer to Elders as those who discuss a topic in depth. Shape, age, wealth, etc. do not necessarily define an Elder. Those who have provided a worthy conclusion on a topic are called Elders. If we want to attain knowledge on a topic, it is beneficial to accept the path of such Elders. \nWhy? Under their guidance, our intellect will not act uncontrollably. Their conclusions (on a topic) act as guide ridges to let your intellect flow properly in the appropriate direction towards the goal. If we step into ‘new topic’ waters by ourselves, we don’t know if it would be muddy, or have whirlpools or dangerous animals! Therefore, taking the support of the conclusions from the Wise, Elders, we can safely do our job there and emerge successfully. That’s why, Sri Krishna Himself accepted it as a good practice. \nWe all must adhere to the vicha:ra dha:ra (thought trail) of Elders. That’s why you don’t have to accept thaththvam (truth) just because I am saying it. Whatever Elders have decided, we must take the same as the base and step ahead in life. Sri Krishna clarifies this in Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, verse 16 and 17. He explains a:thma thaththva (nature of soul) and de:ha thaththva (nature of body). \nIdeally, when learning about these, prama:nas (means of knowledge of eternal truths) explain some aspects. Some aspects are visibly clear while some conclusions can be derived through proper thought. Also, we must make the content declared in sa:sthra (scriptures) or by Elders as the object for the independent intellect that God has given us. We must also carefully recognize it, then decide to move ahead. Since you also have an intellect that can think logically, you can also utilize it and inspect. He says this in the 17th verse. He is demonstrating certain logical methods. He is showcasing reasons. \nLet’s look at the 17th verse.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\navina:si thu thad viddhi ye:na sarvam idam thatham|\nvina:sam avyayasya:sya na kaschith karthum arhathi||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nUnderstand that which is indestructible; nothing can destroy the eternal essence of all beings.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThink about this yourself. No one can destroy you, the a:thma (soul). I explained to you earlier about de:ha thaththva (nature of body) and a:thma thaththva (nature of soul) in the previous verse [16th]. No one can stop the body from changing forms, and no one can bring any change to the soul. He shows the same with an example and reasoning. \nHow? avina:si (indestructible): He is making an assertion. tath avina:si (the soul is undestroyable). Why? ye:na sarvam idam thatham (because it pervades everything). He is using a statement to explain this. Thatham vya:ptham means to pervade. Sarvam means everywhere. sarva thatham (that which permeates everywhere). To pervade is to be able to permeate in everything. There is no limitation on the scope of ‘everything’. It can pervade everything, including what you know in this world to be the most minute. \nHe said, it can permeate there too, i.e. sarva thathamu. sarvatha thathva:th (because it can pervade everything)… realize it to be avina:si (undestroyable). avina:sithu thad viddhi (thus, understand the nature of the soul). vina:sam avyayasya asya na kaschith karthum arhathi (in the aspect of the soul, no one can cause any destruction). Not only you or they, I also cannot do it. He did not exclude anyone in this. I am the all-knowing, all-powerful, I am God. However, I will do only the yukthamu (right thing). I will also not do what is ayukthamu (unfit). \nTherefore, since no one can destroy a:thma (soul) - who you think of as Bhi:shma, is the soul and cannot be destroyed. Avina:si: Hence, the souls, Bhi:shma and Dro:na, are also avina:si (undestroyable souls). So, why cry over that? What is the need to grieve when there is nothing that anyone can do? Sri Krishna is clarifying to Arjuna that you need not feel sorrowful for having to wage war. This is called tharkam (reasoning). \nPrathijna (assertion), he:thuvu (reason), uda:harana (example) are all given and then it is proved. There is a major philosophical vision following this process. Swami is explaining it such that they also understand it. What is He saying? Avina:sithu… He did not say ‘e:thath’, He said ‘thath’. ‘Thath’ denotes something far away. ‘Idam’ denotes something close by. Visible entities are referred to as ‘idam’. Invisible entities are referred to as ‘thath’. A:thma (soul) is referred to as ‘thath’. Hence, it is not visible - meaning it is ‘far away’. \nIdeally, veda:nthis (followers of Upanishads) and tha:rkikas (logicians) belong to two darsanas (philosophical visions). Tharkam and vya:karanam (syntax) are also two paths. It is said that knowledge of these two is essential for everyone. \nka:na:dam pa:nini:yam cha sarva sa:sthra ka:rakam (the science of logic and syntax are essential to everyone). Words must be clear, meaningful, and appropriate. Who would refute this? No matter what subject you want to study, these two are essential to move forward and make conclusions. \nVe:da:nthis also need these two. They make conclusions. These two [science of logic and syntax] protect them in a way that those conclusions are not flawed. The experts of grammar and the experts of logic ensure that those conclusions are set in the right path. Therefore, these two are essential to everyone. The conclusions thus reached are the wealth of knowledge, jna:na sampada (wealth of knowledge)! Knowledge is wealth. In fact, it is the prime wealth for a man. We must enhance this wealth. \nAs this wealth grows, some get jealous and some look for opportunities to steal it. If we want to be protected from these ‘thieves’, there must be guards on either side. The scientists of grammar and logic protect the growing wealth of knowledge from being stolen on both sides. Therefore, we need both. If we look at Ve:da:ntham (the Vedas) as a big fruit garden that yields conclusions on all objects … and there are quite a few of those ‘fruits’ in the garden… people will want to steal them as they explore the garden, climbing onto the trees etc. \nIf we want to protect those ‘fruits’, what do we need? We need a strong fence. Tharka sa:sthra (the science of logic and reasoning) is like a great fence. The stronger it is, the safer the wealth of knowledge. In this verse, He says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thma, i.e. thath avina:si kuthaha sarvatha thathva:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe soul is indestructible; it pervades everything.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is making a beautiful elaboration through this verse. He says, because it is all pervasive… but how does it pervade everywhere? What is it that pervades everywhere? Air pervades everywhere. How do we declare that? It enters a room, it enters a stick, it enters a body. It has a quality of sowkshmyatha (permeability) that enables it to enter everything. A:ka:sa (space) enters and resides at places where air cannot enter. Hence, it implies that space is more subtle than it. A:thma (soul) is ‘thinner’ than it as well. There is nothing more subtle than a:thma. \nSuch a quality of an object is termed parama:rtham (ultimate reality). To refer to the objects, it is called aparama:tham (relative reality). Aparama:rtham means that which is subject to transformations. Parama:rtham is that which is not subject to any transformation. Parama:rtham does not mean eternal entity. Aparama:rtham does not mean illusionary, portraying something to be real when it isn’t. Parama:rthamu is that which does not change. There is nothing that can pervade an a:thma. If anything can enter another, it implies that the host object is a combination of some entities. \nThe entering object will have to make way by splitting the host object’s constituent material. If we use an axe to hit a log, the axe enters the log breaking the log matter into parts. The parts that were once together are now separated into two after the axe enters it. What this implies is that a host object can always be transformed [like the log]. That which is entering it is relatively stable [like the axe]. A:thma can enter everything. Because what is visible are all systems made of organs. It is made of some minute and some large parts. \nIf we look at this cloth, it is made of threads. If we pierce a needle in the cloth, it enters between the threads. The threads then separate. Thus, the needle enters the cloth. Only if something is made of certain other objects, then something thinner, more subtle, can enter it. That host object becomes transformed. The entering object has a relatively longer life. A:thma can enter everything but there is no object that can enter it. We must remember this. How? If we must know this, we must first know the quality of physical elements - earth, air, fire, [water], space. Let’s learn about this next time. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is sarva sastra mayi (the essence of all scriptures), portraying all sciences within it. In addition, it also acts as a support to all sciences. We must always reflect on a topic logically, yukthiyuktham (with reason). The science of using logic to reach conclusions is called tharka sastra (science of reasoning). It means using the right thought in an appropriate way. This approach also allows us to recognize the true form and nature of objects. However, if we want to derive conclusions by ourselves, we can reach only an extent.\nSri Krishna states that it is best for everyone if we take the path of those great people who have already declared these paths historically. He clarifies this in chapter 2, declaring truths about atma (soul) and deha (body). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thma na: s:athvithu\nSanskrit text\na:thma na: s:athvithu\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe soul does not get destroyed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDehas (bodies) do not remain in the same state forever. Therefore, it is not necessary to grieve about atma and dehas. In the process of clarifying this, He speaks of atma as that which will not invite any change to its form, no matter the activity. Why? He gives a reason for this.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsarvattha thaththva:th\nSanskrit text\navina:si thu thad viddhi ye:na sarvam idam thatham|\nSLOKA MEANING -\nKnow that which is indestructible pervades everywhere.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe soul, which is indestructible, pervades everywhere (sarva thatham). How can we say that atma pervades everywhere? Because it is so minute, it can enter everything. It is so minute that there is no object that can enter it. In physics, the smallest particle of matter is known. Scientists have analyzed down to the most indivisible particle, concluding that there is no way to divide it further. It seems atma can enter this particle as well. Because that (quark) is also a union of some parts. If something is made of other parts, it is bound to be divisible later if not today. Whenever there is a union, division becomes inevitable. \nWhereas atma is niravayavi (without parts), no internal parts. Therefore, there is nothing that can be further divided from it. Because there is nothing that it can be divided into, there is no question of it being destroyed. It is impossible for something to enter and destroy it because it is not made of parts. There is nothing that can enter it. This is called atma. Therefore, nothing can destroy atma. Everything else is bigger than it. Atma can enter all these other big entities. We have explained the reason for this. Because they have some constituent parts.\nAll these visible objects are various forms made of pruthvi (earth) material. These are called vikaramulu (variations or formations). In Telugu language, vikaram means an upset stomach with a sensation of nausea. In Sanskrit, vikaram means change, to undergo vikruthi (transformation). If something changes its form, the changed form is called vikruthi. The original form is named prakruthi (original state), the changed one is vikruthi. To change form is called vikaram.\nSo, all these visible objects are variant forms of pruthvi. They are primarily varying forms of matti (earth material). Water enters this earth material. What that implies is that water particles are finer than the earth material particles. Hence, they can enter the earth material particles. Once they enter, the mud particles separate gradually. When water flow is heavy, the mud becomes burada (a thick paste of mud). When heavier, mud-colored water flows through. Furthermore, the water flows in plain color. Water particles have the su:kshmatha (subtlety) that allows them to enter mud and makes it flow along with it. We then say that the mud has dissolved.\nWhat we must remember is that water particles are thinner than the earth particles. Therefore, they enter it. When we sprinkle water on a large quantity of mud, we don’t even notice water. Why? Because the pruthvi material is greater in quantity. Even then, water particles enter it and settle in there somewhere. They get absorbed. However, when water quantity is higher, it dissolves [the mud]. \nThe:jas (fire) particles are subtler than the jala (water) particles. The:jas word sounds vague. We can use fire instead. Any dravyam (material) that has heat is the:jas. Fire particles are thinner than water particles. Therefore, they can enter water too. Fire enters a group of water particles and turns them into the:jomayam (hot water). What does hot water mean? The:jas particles have entered in between the water particles. Thus, water feels hot. If you put the hot water vessel away from the stove for some time, the water restores to its original temperature. The the:jas particles leave the water. Why they leave is a different topic, but they leave. The original state of water is to restore samasilatha (equilibrium), neither too hot nor too cold.\nDuring the process of [the:jas] entering and leaving the water, it may have turned some water particles into steam. Thus, the quantity of water may have reduced by a bit. What must we remember by this? As the jala particles are finer than the pruthvi particles, the the:jas particles are even subtler than the jala particles. Therefore, if they can enter jala, why not into pruthvi? If you heat a vessel made of pruthvi… As jala can enter, the:jas can undoubtedly enter because it is more subtle than jala. That is why when you touch the vessel, you say “Oh! It’s hot, it burned my hand!” Why did your hand burn? There is no change in the vessel, but the the:jas particles that were earlier not present entered it now. They have spaced themselves in between the [earth] particles of the vessel.\nHow long will they be there? If you put the vessel aside from the stove for some time, the the:jas particles exit. The vessel restores its original state. Subtler ones can enter the courser ones. Courser ones cannot enter subtler ones. If you put water on a fire, the fire gets extinguished. Why? Water did not enter in between the fire particles. However, water particles are courser [than fire particles]. So, they smothered the fire. Thus, fire loses its the:jas power. This is in general. If the fire percent is higher, even if you spray water on the fire, it simply transforms the water to steam. Fire particles enter in between the water particles, transforming them into a subtler form, vapor.\nWhat must we remember here? Just as the jala particles are thinner than the pruthvi particles, the:jas particles are thinner than the jala particles. However, when we blow air on fire it wiggles. Why so? The va:yu (air) particles are thinner than the the:jas particles. When they enter the the:jas particles, the fire spreads. Because the air entered, fire spreads out. Air particles are thinner than the fire particles. They are su:kshma thara (more subtle). That is why they are able to enter. However, fire particles cannot enter air particles because they are thicker.\nWe are now clear about - air particles being subtler than pruthvi particles can exist within pruthvi, thinner than jala particles can exist within jala, thinner than the:jas particles can enter and spread the the:jas. Pruthvi helps the growth of a seed to a tree because of the effect of jala. The:jas particles also can enter pruthvi. Va:yu is subtler than the:jas, and hence it enters the:jas and can separate it. A:ka:sa (space) particles are thinner than the va:yu particles. The vedanthins (those who study the Vedas) recognize a:ka:sa as bhu:tham (an element of nature). Whereas some do not consider it as an element and speak of only 4 elements. However, all those who studied Vedas speak of pancha bhu:thas (five elements). They consider a:ka:sa as an element. Therefore, it is also made of particles. These particles are thinner than va:yu particles and hence enter it, enabling the movement of va:yu.\nHowever, va:yu cannot move a:ka:sa because a:ka:sa particles are thicker than the va:yu particles. Thicker particles cannot affect thinner particles. Whereas thinner particles can enter thicker particles and separate them. What we must realize now is the subtlety of a:ka:sa particles. They are so invisible. We can’t see them, but they exist. Where do they exist? They exist in this entire universe. \nA:thma is subtler than the a:ka:sa particles. That is why… Water exists longer than the earth. The:jas exists longer than water. Va:yu exists longer than the:jas. A:ka:sa exists longer than the va:yu. A:thma exists longer than a:ka:sa. Why? There is nothing that can enter it to destroy it. It can enter any of these and therefore material life span is shorter, but a:thma lives eternally. A:thma is therefore avina:si (indestructible).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\navina:sithu thad viddhi\nSanskrit text\nno one can destroy it, neither you nor Me\nSLOKA MEANING -\nKnow that it cannot be destroyed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe souls you are referring to as Bhi:shma or Dro:na do not get destroyed. Then, why cry? Therefore, grieving over atma is foolish. It’s something a small kid would do, not someone wise. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna kaschith karthum arhathi\nSanskrit text\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNo one is capable of doing so.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThus, Sri Krishna is proving the nature of the soul in 2.17. Let’s continue forward gradually. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a scripture-based message given by Sri Krishna to Arjuna. We refer to it as scripture-based because some of the terms and teachings incorporate discussions of scriptures (i.e., Vedas).\nThe terms we often encounter include: \n- Atma (soul)\n- Paramaatma (supreme soul)\n- Prakruthi (nature)\n- Guna (qualities)\n- Karma (actions)\n- Janma (life)\nIf we observe conclusions about these, they are simply declared in slokas (verses). However, understanding these conclusions is only possible if one has studied scriptures. Otherwise, it can be quite challenging. Sri Krishna taught these complex topics in a simple way, likely assuming Arjuna had the necessary qualifications to understand. We also believe we are qualified to discuss such topics. Yet, unless one diligently studies scriptures, they remain difficult to grasp. With some mental effort, one may feel they have understood a little, but we must not claim to have understood everything—perhaps just a bit.\nIn 2.17, when stating conclusions about the atma, He makes a premise and supports it with reasoning. What did He say? The atma is avina:si (indestructible). It is never destructible and doesn’t change its form. It remains in the same form and is beyond any kind of change. Why? He provides reasoning.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsarva thatham\ne:na sarvam idam thatham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBecause of being all-pervasive.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWho is all-pervasive? The atma enters and spreads everywhere. He makes a concluding statement here: if one object enters another, the entering object has relatively longer longevity than the other. The entering object can ‘destroy’ the other—transform it. We have discussed this previously. All worldly objects are made of constituents and therefore need to be entered for transformation. If something has given way for something else to enter it, consider that it is ‘destroyed’. This is true for us as well. If we entertain any unwanted thought, it manifests and troubles us in many ways, making us nervous, etc. If it doesn’t enter and simply crosses through the surface, we won’t have any problem.\nSri Krishna is proving the nature of the soul. The atma enters everything and can penetrate everything; it does not let anything else enter it and therefore is not destructible because the atma is the most minute entity, and there is nothing that can enter it.\nWe may have a doubt here. If one must destroy something, it needs to enter the thing. This is what we discussed. If a tree must be ‘destroyed’, an axe must make its way into it. If an iron wire must be ‘destroyed’, it must be cut by something that enters it, such as a saw or a blade. Something must enter in order to cause destruction. However, when we break a coconut, we do not enter it. We just hit the coconut against a hard stone, and it breaks apart. Did something enter it, or is it the hard hit that destroyed the coconut?\nWe must always remember the meaning of ‘destroy’. The ‘coconut’ is destroyed, but the parts of it exist. The core elements are not destroyed, but the specific form no longer exists. It has become aparama:rdham (that which can change). The spherical form with a tuft is aparama:rdham, while the object itself is parama:rdham (that which does not change). However, the form is aparama:rdham. When the coconut was hit and broken, we destroyed the form of the fruit. Did we enter it? Did it get destroyed only after being entered?\nI have a pot at my place. I just applied pressure on it, and it was destroyed. Nothing like a needle or a stick entered it. I just applied pressure on the surface, and it got destroyed. If something must enter to destroy it, what entered the coconut to destroy it? You may have such a question, right? Has anything entered it when you broke the coconut? You probably hit it on a threshold or used a hard stick or a stone on it, and it broke. Why did it break or get destroyed? It’s a natural question in this context.\nIn this instance as well, we must remember that something entered it to destroy it. What entered it? Air entered and destroyed it. The coconut did not break just by placing it on a stone. The coconut did not break just by hitting it with a hand. It broke because we raised it and hit it hard. What happened? Why did the coconut break? When placed down, there is no momentum. There wasn’t enough momentum for air to get in.\nWhat did we do now? We used a stone or a hard iron stick to hit it. The effect of the used object’s speed does the job. Take it from here and release it with force; it breaks. If we place a hammer on it and simply tap on it or lightly touch it and say ‘break, break…’ or place it there and say ‘as the hammer falls on it, it breaks’, ‘break, break, break…’ What did we do? We applied a force, and the tool that was used has certain balam (energy). If you secure a betel leaf and hit the coconut 10 times or more, nothing happens to the coconut. Whereas if you take a stone or a hammer and hit it, it breaks. This means that the tool’s inherent energy is one factor. The tool itself is another factor. The ve:gam (speed) at which you use it is another factor.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nve:gavath balavath samyo:gam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen the speed and the force are used together this way, air pressure increases on the surface of the coconut.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThus, air entered it so fast that it was imperceptible, and it broke. When you apply force on a pot with pressure, it breaks. We may say that our hand did not enter the pot. However, the pot broke. How? The energy you use and the air that gets in when you apply pressure causes it to break. The particles of the pot wherever air enters through get separated from the rest and thus break into pieces. Hence, even in such objects where we don’t see anything entering, air particles that are subtler than the object particles enter and break them. Water also can break them because water molecules are more subtle than those of earth. The:jas (fire) is subtler than water. Therefore, when a coconut is put on fire, the fire particles enter the coconut shell particles because they are more subtle. That causes the shell to burn, distort its shape, or crack and break into pieces.\nUltimately, an object can be destroyed only if something that can enter the particles of the object is sent through it. However, one must apply force and speed when sending it. The object being used also must have a certain energy. We mentioned this earlier. Using a banana leaf to hit a pot is like someone playfully ‘throwing’ flowers on their loved ones. Nothing breaks. When force is applied, the object breaks as air makes its way through. Therefore, force is always essential. It separates the particles. Only then is there transformation.\nWhat happened? The particles became separated. We must remember this. The separation of the particles in an object is termed as na:samu (destruction). Na:samu means not to be seen. What is it that is not seen anymore? The form that you have once referred to as the pot is now destroyed. The form that you have once referred to as the fruit is now destroyed. Those specific forms are no longer there. It does not mean the object is no longer there. It is seen as pieces. The pot can still be seen in the form of broken pieces. The coconut is available as cut pieces. The form/shape is now unavailable for us. We must remember this.\nWhen we learn that an object gives way for another to enter it, we must also think of its production. When speaking of an object’s destruction, its formation is something to learn about. All worldly objects have a process of formation. Whatever is formed gets destroyed. What does it mean to get formed? It means bonding of some particles. When some parts are joined, it’s termed uththpatthi (formation). When separated, it’s termed vina:sam (destruction/disintegration). We learned that the atma has no internal organs or parts. Therefore, there is no formation or destruction. The rest of the entities in nature are said to be ‘formed’ when the parts join and ‘destroyed’ when they separate. The atma is not made of any such parts. It is nirayavi (without parts). There is no question of it being indestructible. Authentic means of knowledge, sasthra (scripture), and the rushis (sages) have declared that it remains as is. Leaving them aside, we can also think and make sense of the same. The atma’s form is so minute!\nSri Krishna states in 2.17…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvina:sam avyayasya:sya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is named avyayamu (indestructible), which is infrangible.\n-----------------------------------------------\nna kaschith karthum arhathi|\nNot only I, neither you nor anyone can destroy the atma of Dro:na, Bhi:shma, or any of the atmas referred to as ime: jana:dhipa:ha (these kings). So, why cry over it? “I will have to wage war with them, and so they will be killed!” Why worry this way? There is no need to be in sorrow.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naso:chya:n anvaso:chaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWorrying about that which is not worth.\n-----------------------------------------------\nprajna:va:da:mscha bha:shase\nYou are talking like a ‘learned’ one. You are forgetting that the atma is avina:si (not destructible). There is no need to be worried about it. Sri Krishna enlightens Arjuna on his responsibility and alleviates his sorrow.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Sri Krishna Himself delivered the Bhagavad Gita, a supreme scripture to teach responsibility and the ultimate goal to humankind. Arjuna hesitates to wage war. As a responsible ruler from a lineage, he must punish sinners and encourage righteous doers. This is the duty of any ruler. Despite being such an authoritative person and having faced the situation where the stage was set for war between two parties, one standing by dharma (righteousness) and those standing by adharma (unrighteousness), completing 12 years of exile in forests and 1 year of incognito exile, and unsuccessful efforts for peace between the two, ultimately the stage for war is set.\nWhat this means is that the war wasn’t a hasty decision. It wasn’t at all secretive. It became inevitable after having made all essential efforts to avoid it. Only upon concluding that there was no other way to peacefully resolve this, the stage for war was set. Arjuna came prepared for the war along with a 7 akshauhinis (military divisions) army. Duryodhana came prepared for the war with an 11 akshauhinis army. Arjuna wanted to stand between the two armies and observe the foes and allies. However, as he began to look, he started seeing only the physical bond with them and not the sin they committed. He felt pity for them. He thought he should stop the war. He felt that the war could bring many more problems.\nIn such situations, one must not yield to any resulting pitiable condition, but rather only fulfill a responsibility. Feeling pity is a necessary emotion, but it must be shown at an appropriate time and situation. Showing pity at an inappropriate time leads to trouble. As Sri Krishna began to instruct Arjuna about responsibility, He listed three sins. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI bow repeatedly to Sri Rama, the one who removes all obstacles and bestows all wealth.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"Arjuna! You are feeling this emotion at an unsuitable time and situation. This is kasmalam (confusion), a wrongful act. Therefore it is ana:ryajushtam (not accepted by the wise), asvargyam (not leading to heaven), aki:rthikaram (bringing disgrace). A:ryajushtam means that which is accepted by Elders. A:rya jushta is that which is accepted by well-wishers of society. We have learned the definition of a:rya (noble person) earlier. Westerners incorrectly referred to a:ryas as those who hail from a certain location, and the rest from the other side as Dravidians. An a:rya is one who has foresight and accordingly exercises current responsibility, aligning and enabling everything. It is always essential to have their direction. Whatever they happily accept becomes a:ryajushtam. Whatever method they do not accept becomes ana:ryajushtam. Your efforts to avoid this war is ana:ryajushtam. No Elders will accept this.\"\nSri Krishna thus began. He continues to list two more. \"Asvargyam - you think you will reach heaven when you quit this war. However, forget about heaven, you will certainly reach hell. One who quits responsibility will have to experience hell at a later time, after leaving the current body. However, even when in the current body here, society does not appreciate what you are thinking of doing. Hence, it is aki:rthikaram, even while you live in this world.\"\nHe listed these three in the beginning of Bhagavad Gita chapter 2. First - what is the method agreed by a:ryas, the wise, the Elders? What philosophy do they preach? Such wise people do not necessarily belong to one caste, one section, or any specific age group. They must be highly eligible, able to prove the Vedic way and attain the best for society. He started explaining what such people accept. \nWhat we are seeing here is the body on the surface and the indwelling soul. He began by saying it’s the case not only for you and me, but also for everyone else seen around. He said so in chapter 2 verse 12. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna:ha:nate: de:ha:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe soul never dies; it is eternal and indestructible.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe clearly delineated bodies and souls. He stated that souls are different from each other. He proved what He meant by differences: soul is plural, i.e., ane:kathvam (many souls). He proved that He, God, who is giving this Gita upadesa (teaching), is different from the souls. He mentions and explains the difference between Himself and the souls after chapter 6. Until then, He explains the soul, its nature, and the differences between the souls. He explains the characteristics of a body, what happens to it versus to the soul. \nHe had to explain these two as he was looking at the relatives across from him. They were standing there as a union of the two – body and soul. In the two, the body will not remain no matter what we do. It forms a shape, grows, deteriorates, and disintegrates. Bodies will all disintegrate. They will not remain unchanged eternally no matter what you do. Even if you stop the war now, they will not stay forever. Whose [bodies]? Not only those of the opposing army, but also of two specific people who Arjuna was worried about in chapter 2. He was first worried about everyone, both in his army and the opponents’. He felt that he was waging war so all can relish happiness together. He felt sad that there is no purpose to war if they are going to die. He questioned the purpose of the kingdom and all the riches.\nSometime later, in chapter 2, his worry concentrated on two people in particular. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkatham bhi:shmam aham sankhye: dro:nam cha ishubhihi prathiyo:thshya:mi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHow can I shoot arrows at Bhishma and Drona?\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe was sad thinking of Bhishma and Drona. He started with Bhishma, his grandfather, and then Drona, his archery teacher. He expressed - how could he possibly confront his teacher and the family’s elder Bhishma with weapons? Don’t fight with them. Will you be able to protect their bodies forever? Let it be Drona’s, Bhishma’s, or anyone else’s body on the battlefield. Whatever they have done is a sin. They are supporting adharma (unrighteousness). They have already piled up loads of sin. It’s as if they stood there ready to wage war and conclude it so they would not accrue more sin. \nIn one sense, isn’t it better? Now, you say you will quit the war. You are then leaving them to continue sinning. You say that you are pitying them, and you love them. If so, you should think in such a way that their burden doesn’t get heavier than this. They have already made it heavier for themselves and now have come to the point of relieving some of that stock. It’s now your responsibility to cooperate. It is not right for you to leave them, letting them accrue more sin and deteriorate further. Therefore, fight. The war’s outcome is different altogether. You must exercise your duty. Don’t think about whether you or they will win the war. Why must you think of it? \nWhen a surgeon begins to operate, he begins with the right intent. He wishes that the surgery is successful, and the patient emerges healthy. However, undesirable results sometimes occur because of either of their fates. We cannot say it’s the fault of the surgeon. He must perform his duty properly. The result must however be left with prakruthi (nature) or parama:thma (God). It’s the same with you. When you think it is your duty to wage war, do it. “Who will be victorious? What will happen afterwards?” He has so far been explaining that you need not proceed down the path of such a thought trail. \nNow, no matter what you do, you cannot keep your body in the same state forever. Why cry over it? The indwelling soul does not die no matter what you do. Why cry over it? The soul that perhaps leaves a body from this battlefield will attain another body based on its karma (actions). It will be on its way. You are sad that you are going to be away from it. All these 12 years in the forests, haven’t you stayed away from them? The 1 year in incognito exile, haven’t you stayed away from them? Hence, staying away from them is not new. Now that you are working for dharma, it is essential that you exercise your duty effectively. \nHe said so in 2.18. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nanthavantha ime: de:ha:ha nithyasyo:ktha:s sari:rinaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe bodies are temporary, while the soul is eternal.\n-----------------------------------------------\nA:thma (soul) is called sari:ri (one who has a body). What is visible is termed sari:ra (body). Sari:ra means that which is si:rya:the: (deteriorates). It disintegrates as it deteriorates further and further. The indwelling soul is sari:ri. He is ana:si (indestructible), one who is indestructible. He is aprame:yaha (beyond perception), one who cannot be perceived in size and form with the physical eyes. Therefore, you cannot do anything to him. You cannot do anything to stop the body from disintegrating. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:d yuddhyasva bha:ratha!\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, fight the war with no hesitation.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe encouraged thus, explaining the characteristics of the body and of the soul to an extent. He continues to explain further what conduct will please a:ryas, the intelligent and knowledgeable. He encourages him to understand that and conduct accordingly. He does so to ultimately teach mankind their responsibility. Let’s move ahead learning it further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is the essence of a deep teaching. Although Arjuna was used as a means, its target is all of us, society as a whole. With Arjuna in front of Him, God delivered Bhagavad Gita to clarify questions about what is one’s responsibility, how and when we must act, etc.\nWhen performing our duties, we may like it at times and disfavor it at other times. It may make us happy at times and sad at other times. When a hangman administers the death sentence for a criminal by hanging him, it can feel heartbreaking. However, it is his responsibility. It is not necessary to hesitate when exercising responsibility. \nMaking Arjuna duty-oriented, Sri Krishna explains what all humankind must keep in mind when performing their duties. Keeping aside bodily happiness and sorrow, look at the swarupa (nature) of your self – the indweller. It (self) did not originate today, not with the current body. It has eternally been existent. Not knowing our responsibility, we pile up so many karmic records because of the activities we do. Therefore, we are forced to come into this body. It is our responsibility to put an end to this chain of bodies at some point. The loads and loads of karma accrued must be reduced. \nHow? Perform your duties with an informed mind. An informed mind develops when you listen to the teachings of Elders (ones with scriptural knowledge and associated practice) and walk in the direction shown by them. In chapter 2, God explains how we must take the pleasures and pains experienced by the body as we exercise our duties and how we must know about ourselves when carrying out those duties.\nWhen you refer to yourself, he or she or they, although you are showing the body, you are not referring to the body. When the person leaves the body, you say ‘he is no more’. What it implies is that you are not referring to him as the visible body. He had the body [but he is not the body]. The body is that which he thought of as his and indwelled within. Now, it (body) has become achetanam (non-sentient). The soul has left the body. To where? To his (soul’s) next location in his journey.\nWhat is the qualification that the body needs [after a soul leaves it]? It needs to be united with what it has originated from. It is made of five natural elements. It is done by uniting each of the five elements respectively to its origin through agni samskara (fire purification) or other means. Therefore, in short, it is not necessary to constantly worry about working to please the body because it is temporary. A worthy thought is that which works for what stays permanently. What is permanent? It is the indwelling soul. One who knows this is wise.\nHe states the qualities of these in chapter 2, verse 19. What does He say?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nya e:nam ve:tthi hantha:ram yas chainam manyathe: hatham|\nubhau thau na vija:ni:thaha na:yam hanthi na hanyathe:||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever thinks he is killing the soul, and whoever thinks he is being killed, both do not understand. The soul does not kill, nor can it be killed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhoever is thinking he is the doer in the activity of killing… Whoever is thinking he is the karma (object) in the activity of killing… ‘He is going to kill me’ or ‘I am going to be killed by him’... Here, me/I is the karma, the object. He is the kartha (doer). Kill is the kriya (activity). \nIn the sentence, ‘Ram is eating the fruit’… ‘Ram’ is the kartha, doer, ‘the fruit’ is the karma. It is the word that reveals the karma. ‘Eating’ is the kriya. In the kriya of killing, ‘me’ becomes the karma. In the kriya of eating, ‘fruit’ is acting as the karma. Depending on what is acting as what in the kriya, the nature of the respective word is concluded. \nRam is eating the fruit. In the kriya of eating, Ram is the one who is eating, the kartha. The fruit is what is being eaten by him. Thus, it is karma, and he is kartha. He is killing him. In the kriya of killing, the one who is killing is the kartha. The one being killed is taking part as the karma in the kriya of killing. This is how grammarians, those who conclude the nature of words, declare the components of a sentence.\nIn the act of killing, does a jiva (soul) become a kartha or karma? No! Sri Krishna proves so. Jiva neither gets killed nor kills anyone. Jiva is not associated with kartha or karma. Both are the body. It is only through the body that a karma is done, and it is only the body that becomes the kartha. The indwelling jiva is none of the two. \nubhau thau (those who think that jiva is the kartha or that jiva is the karma) na vija:ni:thaha (they are both not wise) Why? na:yam hanthi (does not kill) na hanyathe: (does not get killed by anyone) Why? Because he has the most minute form. This was elaborated earlier. He is very minute; he will not do anything. It is the body that acts. The body was already defined as sharira (that which deteriorates). This verse, 2.19, specifically explains atma (soul). Atma cannot die, and no one can kill it. \nHence, when stating someone is an enemy, or a friend, or belongs to a clan, these do not at all refer to atma. These are all related to the body formed due to karma. All these are associated with the non-sentient body. All these exist only until this body exists. Hence, know yourself first. Perform your duty. You need not think/worry about anything else. \nSri Krishna is getting ready to clearly specify the characteristics of an atma in the 20th verse. Vedas have already stated this. I am clearly stating the same that was stated by Vedas. What is it?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna ja:yathe: mriyathe: va: kada:chith na:yam bhu:thva: bhavitha: va: na bhu:yaha|\najo: nithyas sa:svatho:yam pura:no: na hanyathe: hanyama:ne: sari:re:||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe soul is never born, nor does it ever die. It is eternal and unchanging. The body may perish, but the soul remains unaffected.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBhagavad Gita is revered as the essence of Upanishads. Whatever Upanishads have said, Sri Krishna has said the same in a concise form. He is not making up any of this Himself. You can see certain mantras that are spread across the Vedas in direct forms in Gita. The same is seen in Upanishad. \nna ja:yathe: mriyathe: kuthaschith (There is no birth or death for the soul). Slight variation in the wording, but the same meaning. What is said here? It explains the atma, jiva, i.e., you. Whatever body he takes, he gives life to it and hence is termed jiva. He spreads and occupies it, apnoti (he occupies). He spreads to the extent of the body. Hence, he is named atma. If you look at atma from the perspective of sharira, he is named shariri. From the perspective of deham (body), he is called dehi (indweller). This too, we learned earlier.\nna ja:yathe: (there is no birth to him) na mriyathe: (no death) na:yam bhu:thva: (No jiva takes one form in the past, another in the future. The form is unchanged.) sada: e:ka ru:pa:ya (always in the same form). It is said ‘sadaika rupa’ when speaking of God. Jiva’s form is also the same (unchanging). Therefore, he is never going to be freshly made. \nWhat is it that gets newly made? The association with bodies is the only thing made. Association with bodies is the only thing that gets broken. He, the soul, exists eternally. Nature manifested into bodies exists eternally. Association, disassociation, association, disassociation… When associated with the body, we call it birth. When disassociated with the body, we call it death. \nHe said it so easily in simple terms. However, it is difficult for the heart to absorb it. Even then, it is essential to know what we truly are. Because this knowledge is the foundation to leading life. Let’s try to strengthen this foundation. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We are discussing a:rya jushta jna:na (knowledge accepted by Elders) as instructed by Sri Krishna in Bhagavad Gita, chapter two.\nIn 2.20, the Lord described the characteristics of ji:va (soul). We say so many people are born here and so many others have died somewhere. Birth and death are two words. What do they mean? Many people have a big doubt. You say that souls are not born, but look at the increase in population. Previously, it was said the Indian population was 3 crores. Now it has increased to 135 crores! However, you say souls are not born. Do souls take birth or not? No, they don’t. Do they die or not? No, they don’t. Then why does the population increase? That’s the irony.\nIf we pour water on a plate and tilt it to one side, it feels as if that side is full of water and the other is empty. Similarly, if tilted to the other side, it feels as if that side is full and this side is empty. As long as there is water on the plate, depending on which side we are tilting the plate, it feels as if new water is coming from somewhere to one side and the other side is empty, but we know there is no such thing. We should note that the ‘increase’ in population is happening in a similar way. Souls are never born. They get connected with bodies and then lose that connection after some time. The connection of the soul with the body is termed as birth. Soul leaving bodies is termed death. Souls always exist and bhu:thas (elements) always exist.\nHow is that? Let’s talk about something we all know. Earlier, there were a large number of trees. Trees also have soul in them, right? In every tree, there is a ji:va (soul), not one but many. Our body also has many ji:vas. A microscope reveals hundreds and thousands of living cells within a single drop of blood. Each one has a ji:va. There are crores of such ji:vas in a body, but there is only one monitor or leader whom we refer to as “I”. All the cells in the body work and do their duties properly under his supervision. They never say, “I won’t listen to you, I won’t do it.” If they say that, that means the person has a fever! One cell didn’t follow instructions, formed his team, and started revolting against the leader; hence there was a strike in the body. We can’t bear that when it happens. Sometimes we may get a fever or fall ill… sometimes we may lose our life or at other times we may fall sick and then later recover. This happens when they don’t listen to us; otherwise, we will be fine. We will be living with… and going through our life's journey with crores of ji:vas in us. That same applies for trees as well.\nThis is a body. There are crores of ji:vas in it and a leader for all of them. Even in a tree body, there is a certain “I”, who feels “I am a mango, I am a coconut, I am a custard apple, I am a chikoo, I am a guava, etc.” Whatever [fruit] it is… There is someone [leader cell] who thinks of it as him and is referred to by a name. Along with him is a congregation of several ji:vas (member souls) spreading through the body as his life substance. He [leader soul] imposes his characteristics on all the member souls based on his karma (actions). Hence, all of them smell of guava, etc. Whatever characteristics we built due to our karma, we have imposed the same [to the member souls]. Thus, we think of ourselves by a specific name. The same goes for trees and animals as well - be it fish, hens, goats, pigs, or any others.\nIn the past, the human population was only 3 crores. At that time, the population of the rest of the species was very high. The population of insects, trees, and animals was high and everyone lived in their domains. After man became greedy, degraded in thought, and devoid of knowledge of what is right or wrong, he started cutting down all the trees. He started killing anything that moved, all the different types of animals, and eating them. Our hearts break when we hear how many lakhs of animals are slaughtered like that every day. Man is separating so many ji:vas from their bodies. It is fine if he separates them, but in addition, he is not giving them an opportunity to take birth again. \nFor example, in hens, they use technology to make sure hens don’t lay eggs or even if they do, the eggs don’t hatch. If man allowed the eggs to hatch, hens could have increased their race on their own. Now using artificial means, man made sure they don’t lay eggs or the eggs don’t hatch. These are called broiler hens. What will happen to the ji:vas who are supposed to be born in them? If we left them on their own, there would be some ji:vas in the bodies of hens, goats, fish, etc. Man is cutting all the trees and transforming forests into concrete jungles. What will happen to the ji:vas who are supposed to be in those trees? We are preventing them from entering their destined bodies. And humans have no control. That is, we have opened the doors here and closed the doors there. So, whoever is supposed to be born there is coming to us. \nThe population is increasing because ji:vas who are supposed to be born in animal bodies like dogs, hens, fish, goats, trees, or insects like flies or mosquitoes, are unable to take birth there or get new bodies there. Since they have to go wherever they can to get bodies and there are plenty of opportunities to get new bodies as humans, they are being born as humans. They need to get a body and they are getting bodies as humans. We may recall the Y2K dilemma. Western countries were concerned that all their computer programs would crash. So they ‘imported’ everyone from across the world, especially from India, who had the slightest knowledge of computers. However, 5 to 6 years later, they felt these people weren’t qualified. Hence, not needing them, sent them back. At first, it was a ‘boom’ for those folks, followed by ‘doom’. We know of situations where they had to leave everything as is and return all of a sudden. Just like the water which flows wherever there is opportunity, these souls also got ready to take bodies wherever there was opportunity. \nSo the souls supposed to be born as animals, trees, and insects took birth as humans. Therefore, there are animals roaming around in human form. There are insects and wild animals who are born as humans. Today we see so many atrocities being committed by humans. Aren’t they all human beings? Can humans do such things? Can such a thought process exist in humans? We don’t know. Yet it is there! It means he should have been in some forest as a wild animal. Instead, he was born as a human. The human population increased because we kept the doors open here so they took several bodies as humans… but maybe they were actually destined to be a different species altogether! Ji:vas didn’t increase but they occupied more space [in the human plane]. \nJust as we tilt a plate to one side, we feel water is unevenly spread; the flow of ji:vas meant to go elsewhere came towards the human race. Hence the human population has grown to 7 billion. However, the count of ji:vas has not increased. It remained constant. We don’t know how many there are. In nature, everything else is in the same proportion as it should be, except they change places and formations. If there is a big flood somewhere, water is not being ‘created’ there. The water which was supposed to be at some other place came to this side. Hence, a drought occurred in one place and a flood at another. Similarly, if water flows to another place, a flood occurs there and a drought results at some other place. To maintain a stable situation everywhere, man has to work very hard. Or man shouldn’t be doing impious acts. We are not able to ensure people avoid sinful acts. So, we see these imbalances as of late. We notice the domination of the human race and how humans prevent any other race from living in their natural state.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna ja:yathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n[ji:vas] are not born\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn 2.20, the Lord is giving an upade:sa (instruction). This instruction is not given to deceive Arjuna. It is not meant to be an entertaining speech for someone who just finished his lunch. Nor was it given because others instructed Him to do so as he had no other work. The Lord is not talking about ma:ya thatthva (illusion), but rather the real thatthva (truth). Because the aim of this teaching was to relieve the sorrow of the one who is in sorrow and to provoke thought in the one who stopped thinking, Sri Krishna took up the task of stating actual truths the way they are. \nLord is summarizing what the Ve:das (sacred texts) have declared - thaththva (eternal truths) to mankind via Arjuna. Therefore, He says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna ja:yathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nji:va is not newly born\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna mri:yathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nji:va don’t die either\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe can neither be born nor die today, tomorrow, or yesterday. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbhu:thva: bhavitha: bhu:yaha bhavitha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nhe is eternally this way\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf he wasn’t there until now and will come into existence now, we can call him bhu:thva. Or if he is not there now and will come into existence tomorrow, we can call him bhavitha. If he was there once and came into existence again, we can call him punaha bhu: bhavitha. There is nothing like that with ji:va. He is nithya (always existing), ajaha (no death). Sri Krishna explains this very clearly in verse 2.20. Let's try to understand it. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), a human being needs to understand himself through a:thma:valo:kanam (self-reflection), which is very essential. It is not possible for other beings because they work only in view of the physical body while in that body. Therefore, there is no possibility for introspection in them. However, a human being has the ability to think beyond the body, about the inner mechanism, and respond accordingly. Humans are given such intellectual ability. Therefore, Sri Krishna teaches the Bhagavad Gita, the thought process a human intellect should practice. He graces us with a:thma thatthva jna:na (knowledge of self).\nIf one must perform one’s duties, she or he must be able to put aside the pleasures and pains during the process. Military personnel are required to walk along the borders of a nation. It could be walking in the snow, dirt, rough terrains, hiking through the mountains, or going down the valleys. Their vehicles may not be useful in all conditions. Even then, they must be cautious while on guard. They must be able to control the enemy and restrict its movements to its own boundaries. Sometimes, they will face challenging situations. In fact, they almost always face challenging situations. 24/7! They must be alert all the time, to the point of being sleep-deprived. When they think of their duty, physical comfort becomes secondary to work. One who craves bodily comforts will not take up such a job. Only those not worrying about self or body, and who are solely focused on protecting their country can get into such bold activities.\nFrom the soul’s perspective, the body that it entered is a country. The society surrounding him is this country’s (i.e. ‘his’ body) boundary. What must he know here? Essentially, he must know how to conduct himself. One who is at the border, knowing who he is, tolerates any pain to the body or any pleasure such as a sumptuous meal. He does not respond in the extreme either for pleasure or for pain. The temporary feeling of a ‘favorable’ or ‘unfavorable’ experience is natural to an extent. However, one must not dwell over it forever.\nWe have heard of some incidents such as the Kargil war. We have heard of great soldiers in mountainous terrains tolerating pain from a nearly broken leg for days together while trying to reach the base for treatment. Can a normal person tolerate that? Even for slightly peeled skin when cutting nails, we see people shouting loud in pain as if his house was burnt down. Even for a lightly affected finger, we see people crying so loud as if the Earth and Sky came together! We even see people having a hard time getting up from a chair or sitting down after standing. However, others do not mind any painful conditions and orient themselves towards carrying out their duties.\nArjuna! Similarly, a human being must only move forward in conducting their responsibilities. He must neither think about the favorability of his body, nor his family. He must not worry about family approval. One must not let such thoughts arise. Why? All those watching you are going to change. Why worry about them? You see it raining now, and after some time, it stops. After a cloud precipitates its contents, it will not rain further. Therefore, you need not get excited or worried about a rain cloud. You need not think of it as an impediment for your journey or your work. If you tolerate it for some time, it will stop by itself.\nBodies are also the same way. You now have the opportunity to do dharma yuddham (righteous war), to fight for a righteous cause, and it’s your duty to take your part. Nothing happens to the a:thma (soul). Those you are worried about hurting, all of them (a:thmas) will be fine because it is dharma yuddham. Whoever leaves the body in dharma yuddham will certainly attain a better state such as swarga (heaven) or something similar. Therefore, why worry about them? It was already concluded that whoever loses body in dharma yuddham will attain vi:ra swargam (heavenly planes). When all of them are ready for dharma yuddham, shouldn’t you get ready too? Why are you thinking about something happening to them? Therefore, be prepared to wage war. It is not at all a sinful act. Sri Krishna teaches thus and encourages him to move forward. He says, ‘Firstly, learn who you are!’\nIn the 20th verse…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\najaha nithyaha sa:svathaha pura:naha\nna hanyathe: hanyama:ne: sari:re:||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhatever is being cut or killed is the body, not you! Even while indwelling in such a changing body, you are not one who undergoes any change. You just need to realize it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou are not the one changing, He says beautifully. ajaha (no birth), you are not being added as a new being; nithyaha (exists eternally), then now and later. If one is born today, it means he wasn’t around yesterday. If one is gone today, it means he won’t be around tomorrow. Ji:va (living being) is not that way. He will exist tomorrow, exists today, and existed yesterday. Hence, he is nithyaha (exists forever with no change at all the three time spaces).\nthraika:lika abadhyaha nithya (unchanging eternal existence at all the three time spaces) sa:svathaha (no change in form despite the journey). There are two words, nithya and sa:svatha. They seem like synonyms. However, they are not synonymous. There is a difference. Nithya means that he stays the same with no change at all the three time spaces. Sa:svathaha means that which does not change in form, such as getting fatter, thinner, shorter, wider, or sliced up etc. Does ji:va change forms that way and still exist at all three time spaces? No! sasvath bhavathi (exists in the same form always).\nUse of the word nithya indicates only eternal existence but does not indicate whether he goes through any change. In that way, even matti (clay) can be described as nithya. Why? Because when mixed with water, it becomes a pot. When a pot is broken to pieces and crushed, it becomes powder. The powder can simply become clay. We know of these changes. Clay/soil always exists [in different shapes]. mrutthike:aiva sathyam (clay/soil does not change). However, it takes various shapes. It exists in various shapes. So, does a:thma (soul) also take various shapes? sa:svathaha (same form yesterday, today and tomorrow). There is no change in its shape.\nTwo describing words, nithyaha and sa:svathaha. There is a hairline difference between the two. We need to understand. pura:naha (does not get soiled despite its eternally existing nature) pura:pi navam (he is the same now as he was; he will be the same tomorrow as he is today). He never ages, despite existing forever. He does not get ‘dirty’. We see some battery-operated diyas (lamps). In the beginning, their glow is very bright. After a few days, the glow declines gradually. Finally, it keeps going on and off. Does a:thma have such a state? Diya exists, but the volume, intensity of its glow is changing. A:thma does not have this [change in intensity…]. It's always filled with light. It never requires anyone external to prove its existence.\nThis is what He is saying…\najaha nithyaha sa:svathaha\npura: naha, pura:pi nava pura:naha\nalways illuminating like that which has just been made. Any object gets old after some time, right? Even the words we speak get old. People say, “why these old statements like ‘old tamarind pickle’!?” They wouldn’t say so if they knew its health benefits. A:thma does not get old. Generally, when something [edible] gets old, the shape or color changes. A red one will turn white, white into some other, another into some other. However, the qualities of a:thma do not age in any manner.\nna hanyathe: (it does not get killed). It does not get killed even when the body it resides in is killed. hanyama:ne: sari:re:sathi na hanyathe: (The body will disintegrate for sure. No matter what one does, ultimately it must disintegrate). Even though you cry, it will still need to disintegrate [at some point in time]. If you try to protect your body by freezing yourself, you will lose it even faster. na hanyathe: (ji:va can never get killed). hanyama:ne: sari:re: (This body is made of elements of nature). Knives are also made of elements of nature. Substances made of nature can be used to handle other substances made of nature. However, it's impossible to handle a:thma with substances made of nature. It can be handled only via knowledge. This is what you must know.\nUpanishads stated the same. Our A:nda:l said the same. Lord Sri Krishna declares the same. Our rushis (sages) and a:lwa:rs (saints) have stated the same. Our A:cha:ryas (teachers) said the same. “Understand the nature of a:thma.” Hence, why cry and worry about having to kill Bhi:shma, Dro:na etc. There is no need to cry. Step forward to perform your duty happily. Sri Krishna thus encourages [Arjuna] to prepare himself to perform his duty. Let’s listen further to what He says. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Grief is that which comes to a human being upon invitation. It is that which manifests when one’s intellect declines. One can be free from grief when one gains valuable knowledge through Elders or learning on one’s own. The Upanishad states, \"tharathi so:kam a:thmavith\" (one who knows the nature of the soul will not experience grief). \nArjuna was experiencing grief in performing his duty. Sri Krishna taught Bhagavad Gita to alleviate Arjuna’s sorrow. We also experience grief while doing our duties in fear of losing any possessions, or attaining something undesirable, or for failing to attain the desirable, or for not getting rid of anything undesired, or for something unnecessary coming our way. One may experience different degrees of sorrow. How much should we care about such sorrow? Should we limit it to the level of the body, or at the level of the soul? If we attain a:thma thaththva jna:na (knowledge of the soul), we can tolerate any kind of discomfort to the body. We need not cry over anything unnecessarily.\nIn 2.21, in the process of educating Arjuna on his duty, Sri Krishna questions him about who can kill another. He teaches him that all souls act as per their own karma.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nveda:vina:sinam nithyam ya e:nam ajam avyayam |\nkattham sa purushah pa:rttha! kam gha:thayathi hanthi kam ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nKnow that which is ought to be known. What must he know? Know that you will never perish. This is what He is stating, the summary.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe ji:va (soul), i.e., each one of us, never dies. Why is he avina:si (imperishable)? Because he is nithya (ever existing)! Anything that is nithya is imperishable. The sky is nithya. Does anyone say that the sky has perished? No! Anything nithya is imperishable. Earth, air, water, fire - they do not perish. If not seen here, they are somewhere else. They reached somewhere else. We must remember this fact. \nThe a:thma (soul) does not perish. Why? He states that a:thma is nithya, ever existing. What type of being is he? How do we know him? It is enough to know him as ajam (without birth) and avyayam (imperishable). Ajam means one who doesn’t take birth. Avyayam means one who has no deterioration. The body gradually deteriorates. One who may be 6 feet tall shrinks down to 3 or 4 feet in old age. This means that the substances composing the body are gradually reaching their sources. The respective constituent elements of the body reach their sources. The body also reaches its source which is matti (earth).\nHow about ji:vas (souls), all of us? Where should we reach? It should not be a place that makes one ignorant. It should not be a place that’s known for ignorance. It should be a place where there is glory of knowledge. When this is the goal, we travel there. We, therefore, do not cry over this. There is no such concept as ‘killing’. Therefore, understand this.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\najam avyayam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthat with no birth and no deterioration\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe ji:va is by nature knowledgeable, without deterioration. However, it ‘deteriorates’ because of karma. He gets enveloped into a ‘deteriorated’ state when loads of karma dominate him. His [original] state becomes visible to the extent that his karma is relieved, i.e., as karmic influence is reduced. As a lamp is cleaned, the clarity of its light increases accordingly. However, we cannot see the diya (lamp) if smoke accumulates into thick soot. This is what we must remember. The soul is never in a gradual decline. The accumulated soot makes people think the light of the lamp is fading… a diya keeps glowing even if the sooty smoke blocks our vision. Because it (lamp, i.e., body) is ache:thana (inanimate). It is made out of ache:thana substance. The ji:va is che:thana (conscious). Diminishing knowledge does not apply to him.\nThe sun, for example, exudes light. When he supplies it to us, we say it is our daytime. When he is not facing our side, he is giving the same to a different area. He is not idle even for a moment. We get tired after working during the day and take rest later. Does the sun sleep?! Does he diminish? It is said that he diminishes after many millions and billions of years, something we cannot perceive. Exquisitely, a:thma’s jna:na a:kruthi (knowledge form) is eternal and also does not change. Hence, it is avyayam, that to which vyavam (deterioration) is not applicable.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\najam avyayam e:nam yaha avina:sinam nithyam ve:da\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt has two qualities, ajam and avyayam. It is indestructible, and thus recognized to be eternally existing.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSo, why do you say that you will be killed or worry that he will be killed? What does it mean to kill or get killed? Can a ji:va ever die? You are the indwelling ji:va. Can you exhibit your ability outside of a body? No. To teach him the knowledge of the soul, Sri Krishna separates the characteristics of the body and demonstrates it. He thus explains what is the nature of a:thma.\nHe is elaborating the same in another beautiful method. He compares bodies with clothes. He uses an example of clothes to help us understand. Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2, verse 22…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvasa:msi ji:rna:ni yattha: viha:ya nava:ni gruhna:thi naro::para:ni |\nthattha: sari:ra:ni: viha:ya ji:rna:ni anya:ni samya:thi nava:ni de:hi: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nJust as a human being sheds worn-out clothes and accepts new ones, in the same way, the soul leaves the worn-out body and accepts a new one based on karma.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt’s a great verse, one heard often. If not during someone’s lifetime, then at the time of death. Maybe people think it is applicable only at such times and not at other times. Hence, they recite it in such situations, and not otherwise. It’s a great verse though. \nWhat do we do? We wear clothes to protect the body. Afterward, the clothes may get soiled or wet. What do we do then? We wash and dry the current set of clothes, putting on a fresh dried one. Do we stay in the same soiled set of clothes… or a torn set of clothes? We don’t know why, it’s a trend these days to wear intentionally torn and stitched clothes. It has become a fashion. Elders believed that wearing purposely torn clothes is not auspicious. It is inauspicious for those wearing and for others around. We must realize that putting on fresh and neat clothes can negate that inauspiciousness.\nAnyways, clothes protect us when worn - they then get soiled after some time. We then put them away and take on a new set of clothes. We have done this countless times since entering this body. The number of days in this body is less than the number of times we have changed clothes. People wear one outfit in the morning and probably change to another in the afternoon, and another in the evening. Some “cool” people change into new clothes for every instance. They feel that what’s used once must not be used again. When bought to be used only once, it is named ji:rna vasthra (worn-out clothing). He purchases it to use it only once. So, he sheds it after using it once. Does he cry because he has to shed it after having it on for the whole day? He doesn’t. He puts on new clothes happily!\nThus, you are not sad about having to change to new clothes after the old is soiled. Similarly, for you, the indwelling ji:va, the body is also a vasthra (protective cloth). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvas thra\nSLOKA MEANING -\nvas, that which is on you; thra, that which protects you\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe are not worried about changing these vasthras, getting a new one. We happily accept them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvasa:msi ji:rna:ni yattha: viha:ya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nleaving them\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnava:ni gruhna:thi \nSLOKA MEANING -\naccepting new\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnaraha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nhuman being\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\napara:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nanother new body\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthattha: sari:ra:ni: viha:ya ji:rna:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nin the same way, leaving the body that is worn out after using\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nanya:ni samya:thi nava:ni de:hi:\nSLOKA MEANING -\ngets a new proper vasthra (body) based on the karma as decided by Him, by nature\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe then gets a new body and is named de:hi (the one who possesses a body). What he shed was sari:ra (body), what he wears is de:ha (body). As soon as wearing it, he wishes to acquire things and add to it. That which is able to accept what’s added to it and thus grow, is termed de:ha. Once the accumulation is done, each part gradually begins to deteriorate. That surface which is in the state of deterioration (si:ryathe:), hence it is termed sari:ra.\nRohit Nannegari - why was this frame deleted? | Two names for the same body - de:ha in the growth phase and sari:ra in the deteriorating phase. Simple! When someone’s body is young and growing, don’t ask – “how is your sari:ra?” Ask, “how is your de:ha?” That’s when it is auspicious to him. It indicates a blessing of wellness. \nThis is what we must realize. When de:has (bodies) are ready to shed by themselves or when they are shed, it’s not necessary to cry. Just as we are ready to change clothes, we must be ready to change the body. What it means is that we must not cry about it. We must not cry about the deteriorated body or the ji:va having left it. The ji:va is happy with a new vasthra, a protective layer (body). Why cry? \nSri Krishna is thus consoling Arjuna and giving us hitham (a message that is beneficial and favorable) for us. Let’s learn further… Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), New things don’t necessarily give joy, and old things don’t necessarily give grief. Old is not necessarily bad, and new is not necessarily good. Arjuna is questioning this with Sri Krishna.\nIn Bhagavad Gita 2.22, Sri Krishna elaborates on the nature of the body. There is no need to cry over bodies or souls because souls always live. Bodies are like clothes that we wear. We wear new clothes and change them after using them for some time. We put on new ones again, and change. This repeats. How many clothes don’t we change!? Similarly, we change into so many bodies. When bodies are things that change, why cry? He said it so easily as if something that we need not ponder….\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvasa:msi ji:rna:ni yattha: viha:ya nava:ni gruhna:thi naro::para:ni |\nthattha: sari:ra:ni: viha:ya ji:rna:ni anya:ni samya:thi nava:ni de:hi: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nJust as a person discards old clothes and puts on new ones, the soul discards old bodies and takes on new ones.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe stated that because we leave bodies just as we leave a used object, we must not worry about those bodies. Arjuna stopped Him here. You are speaking of acceptance of leaving old used bodies. However, are there only old used bodies on this battlefield? There may be a few old people. There are so many youth, middle-aged, and children as well. Don’t we feel sad to lose such people? Why do you say ji:rna vasthra (old and used bodies)? He asks!\nThen, Krishna articulates with precision using the teachings of pu:rva a:cha:ryas (previous teachers). Any of the bodies can be called ji:rna vasthra! When will something become ji:rna vasthra? When something is used to the extent for which it is made, it is ji:rnam (old). When it is used the number of times it was intended for, it is ji:rnam. Doctors these days are using single-use disposable syringes. Once used to inject, it cannot be used again for another person. Do we question anyone about why it’s being disposed of after a single use? The needle still looks okay, still able to pierce. We are not asking for it to be sterilized and reused, are we? Because it is dangerous. Even more dangerous considering COVID. It cannot be used for another person or even the same person. Why? Its very purpose was single-use. Hence, it must be disposed of after a single use no matter what its state.\nWe know of surgical gloves for hands. They may look fine after using them once for surgery. However, they get disposed of immediately. With COVID, there are PPEs (personal protective equipment). They are worn as external bodies. After using them for a specified time and purpose, they are meant to be disposed of carefully. They are not meant to be reused. Though they look good, their purpose is for a single use and hence not reusable. Therefore, they are considered ji:rna (old).\nWe all know ice-cream cups. Once we have eaten the ice-cream, the cup might still be intact. Even the wooden spoon that comes with it looks reusable after the first use. You can wash and keep it with you, but do you? Even if you want to, people looking at you will laugh, object, and shame you. So, people throw these disposables away after using them. Right? Why? Because they are made for single-use. Therefore they must be disposed of. It’s the same with bodies. It’s not the question of a 16-year-old, 30-year-old, 40, 50, or 100 years old. The question is how long a body is meant for.\nAbhimanyu died at the age of 16 on the battlefield. Arjuna wept immensely. He had already heard Bhagavad Gita. The situation brought him to experience what he had heard. He felt he could not live without his son and he kept crying. As the sun was setting, he was getting ready to lose his life as well. Sri Krishna reminded him that all these are ji:rna vasthras. He still questioned how it [Abhimanyu’s body] could be ji:rna vasthra. Maybe I [Arjuna’s body] can be considered ji:rna vasthra, but Abhimanyu was not even 16 years old, a young kid!\nThat’s when Sri Krishna explained - what is the meaning of ji:rna? For whatever purpose it was made, even if for 16 years duration, all it needs is a reason to retire on time. The battlefield became the grounds for such a reason [to retire]. He left [the body]. The situations leading to it may provide the reason, but the purpose was only to that extent. Thus, it means it is ready to retire from that purpose. Even if it looks fine on the surface, it must be disposed of. Therefore, vasa:msi ji:rna:ni (old clothes)…\nYou need not hesitate from disposing of the bodies. Furthermore, where will he go after leaving this body? This is another question. At least until now, there is a body for him. He is eating 2 or 3 times a day, moving around with relatives and all. He is moving around in human form. Once he leaves this body, is there a guarantee that he will come back as a human being? Or is there a guarantee that he will get a better body? No! Then, how can one be ready to leave the current state? Because if he gets a worse body, what is the use of leaving it? Who will want to leave in such a case? Is that necessary?\nAn analogy…there is someone living in a small hut. He lives with the sun and the moon in it, the roof as barely a few palm leaves. He was adjusting. In the same town, a new jail was constructed with a strong foundation. Why do you want to live in that poor hut? We built a nice jail for you, why don’t you come in and live there? If someone asks him that, would it become an acceptable offer? He will not be interested just because it is new, unless it gives happiness. If it is a worse place, would anyone leave their home and go there?\nLet’s say someone was moving around in his not-so-great clothes, soiled, worn out, and torn. Another person says that he would give him new clothes made of jute fiber. Change to those new ones. Will he take it? When one has the assurance of obtaining something better than current possessions, he will look forward to it. He may not look forward, because whatever he has currently is fine. He would not have the current state once it’s gone. So, one would not be ready for change. If it is to bring pain, he wouldn’t even think about wanting it.\nElders gave us the answer for this. When one sheds body while carrying out his responsibilities, in this case fighting the dharma yuddha (righteous war)…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nramani:ya:m yo:nim a:padyanthe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n…he will attain a comparatively more qualified, greater, beautiful body than the current one.\n-----------------------------------------------\nOne who sheds the body fighting adharma yuddha (unrighteous war) will have hard times. One who fights dharma yuddha will not have any limitations. Isn’t this dharma yuddha? You did not want this to happen. The situation came up by itself. When one exercises his duties and wages war in such situations… The duty here [for Arjuna] is to fight in the war. It could be something else for another. Whoever sheds their body for some reason while carrying out their responsibility will attain a better body than the current one. Sa:sthra (scripture), the ultimate science, declares that he gets a ramani:ya (wonderful) body.\nTherefore, there is no need to be worried.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnava:ni gruhna:thi naro::para:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who fights in dharma yuddha will also attain and ‘put on’ a new, better, more beautiful body just as you would change into new clothes.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere is no need to cry! What He did was elaborate on the nature of the soul and concluded there is no need to cry…. the nature of the body and concluded there is no need to cry. There is a great dhvani (meaning), profound meaning, here. What is it? God is in fact the owner of this (body). We are residing in this house. This house was bestowed to us because God has given it. We did not submit any application to get it. We just happened to be in this.\nAfter a certain while, we attained knowledge about its nature, probably due to some teachings or some other reasons. It is not something that was natural to us or something we sought for. He gave it. Hence, it's His. You are in it. So, you are a resident. He is the owner. If you obey the orders of the owner and live in accordance with His wish, He will always give you joy. The owner will grant you what you wish for.\nWhoever attains this knowledge that this is a vasthra (clothing), de:ha (body), and that the owner is God… any owner would give good ‘clothes’, valuable ‘clothes’, to those He likes. He (the owner) lets the others also stay in the house as part of the family out of compulsion, but not with interest. Some behave this way. Right? Similarly, because He is the one who is giving us all this, if we can live in line with Him and try to attain knowledge in the manner He recommends… He will give good ‘clothes’ to all of us.\nWhat it means is that He will definitely grace us with a better body than the current one, better experience than the current one, the greatest ‘pleasures’ compared to the current ones. As part of 2.22, He explains that when you are in accordance with the owner, He will grant and grace you with great ‘clothes’, letting you shine and experience joy. If God is happy, He will give you a de:ha (body) that is suitable to reside in His divine abode, known as Paramapadam (supreme abode) or Sri Vaikuntam (heaven), and grace you to an equally blissful state as His.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmama sa:dharmyam a:gatha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhatever body and joy that I possess, you will get the same kind of body and joy.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou will not need to reside in the cycle of srusti (creation), and pralayam (dissolution). Therefore, be in line and in accordance with the owner, God. He Himself is sitting in front as Sri Krishna and ordering Arjuna to fulfill his responsibility. He is ordering him to perform his duty, encouraging him to wage war! It is Arjuna’s duty to do so without any hesitation. It is the same for us. Whatever is our duty assigned by vidhi (law of existence), we must do it with no hesitation. If we perform accordingly, He will then give us better bodies. This body will be ‘gone’ after a while. Because we want a better body than this, He will carefully drive us accordingly. This is the dhvani clearly seen in the verse. He moves forward elaborating further on the soul's nature. Let’s listen in. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Through Bhagavad Gita, God is teaching mankind the path accepted by Elders (those with firm scriptural knowledge and practice). The human body is given for the purpose of exercising one’s duty…that which benefits society around you. Sometimes, trying to benefit someone can also bring pain. A mother opts to punish her child who is being stubborn, cranky, not studying, etc. Though punishment is not recommended, she does so for the child’s benefit. The father also chooses the same for the child’s benefit. This is what a well-wisher does.\nSri Krishna has the desire for the well-being of humankind. He therefore uses the situation with Arjuna as a means to enlighten human beings with thathva jna:na (knowledge of reality). As part of that, He is explaining ‘souls’. He explained ‘bodies’ with an analogy of the clothes we wear. We put on a set of clothes and change into new clothes at the appropriate time. We don’t worry when changing into new clothes. Similarly, we change bodies based on karma (recorded history of one’s actions), and hence need not be worried [about the change in bodies]. He clarified this.\nSoul’s nature! If visible, would be easy to explain. This is not the case, hence, God takes all the pain to explain this in chapter 2. Explaining a:thma (soul), He elaborates on why it does not get destroyed. What must happen for something to be destroyed? This is also a process like eating, drinking, watching, hitting, killing, etc. What exactly happens in the process of killing something? This is what we need to know. He is explaining it here.\nWhen we take a knife to slice a fruit, what do we do? We insert a knife and break it apart. Then, we say it has been cut open. We need a suitable tool to cut. Whatever is targeted to be cut needs a substance that can be cut. [The fruit] It must have the quality of being cut. [The knife] It must be able to cut. One must be able to cut and the other must accept the cut. Only then, it will be possible to cut the fruit. Otherwise, it is not possible to cut it.\nIf you take a betel leaf and try to cut the fruit…the fruit has the quality of accepting the cut but…the leaf does not have the ability to cut it. Right? Similarly, if using a knife to cut a diamond…the knife has the ability to cut. The diamond does not have the quality of being cut by a knife. Therefore, it will not be in such a state. Why go to the level of diamond? Let’s take water or air. What happens if you pick up a sword and try to cut wind, moving air? Air cannot be cut. One may try to swing his sword from this end to another, or use a hammer and hit it. His hand will merely hurt, but air does not get broken into pieces. If trying to slice water, the same situation. Water also does not have the quality of being broken. If it is a chunk of ice, there is a possibility of breaking it. However, cutting water to slices - that never happens. Water does not have the eligibility of being cut. A knife does not have the ability to cut it. We hope you understand.\nSimilarly, a:thma is an object. You say you are going to be killing the a:thmas (souls). However, does an a:thma have the eligibility of getting killed? Is there any object that has the ability to kill a:thma? Killing is to break it, separate it into pieces. Breaking a fruit into pieces involves piercing it. If you need to break the floor, you need to make way into it to do so. One must chisel into a stone and break it. The instrument does the task [of breaking it]. What is the instrument that can break a:thma? This is the question. You may say we can use anything to break. Can you use a knife? Can a knife go into the a:thma? It cannot. A:thma is so subtle, very, very small. Even raising 10 to the power of -26, it cannot be reached. There is no question of separating it into any pieces. For example, fruit requires cutting it into pieces in order to be broken. A:thma is defined as niravayavi (that which does not have any parts). What do we break it into? It can enter into anything, including the very knife that we want to use for breaking it! Because a:thma is so minute.\nWe are able to hear what others are saying via a phone. Whatever that other person is speaking is reaching us. What are they reaching us through? Can you ‘see’ the words? They are getting transmitted. You are responding back as well. There are signals that carry these words to you. Those signals are extremely minute. How small are they? Even if sitting inside a closed room, they can enter it. How? Wherever there is a possible space, they penetrate. It could be through windows or some gap between the door and the floor. Or they can also enter through light rays. We don’t know how thin the rays of light are. Therefore, we cannot recognize them because of their su:kshmathvam (subtleness). We know this.\nIs there anything that can possibly enter a:thma? nainam chhindanthi sasthrani: (weapons cannot cut it), says so in the 23rd verse:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnainam chhindanthi sasthrani: \nnainam dahathi pa:vakaha |\nna chainam kle:dayanthy a:po: na so:shayathi ma:ruthaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWeapons cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it, water cannot wet it, and wind cannot dry it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna! Anything that is used to break, cut, or kill a:thma, must be able to first get into it. If it enters, then there is a possibility to cut it. You cannot insert any weapon into a:thma. Therefore, cutting it is ruled out. nainam chhindanthi sasthrani: Okay, maybe it’s not possible to cut it. How about burning it? Can we? No. Why? Rays of fire particles will be able to enter a:thma only if a:thma is made of a minimum of two parts. A:thma is subtler than the cells of the fire particles. Hence, it is not possible for them to enter.\nIf you put a stone in the midst of flowing water, the water simply flows around the stone. The stone stays as is. Whereas, what happens if you place some sand? The water particles are subtler than the sand particles, so they enter in and if the pressure is high, break them and the sand particles float along with them. Because the stone particles are thicker than the water particles, there is no chance of the opposite. Hence, they make their way around the stone and move ahead. What it means is that the water particles are thinner than the earth particles. They are subtler, smaller. Fire particles are thinner and smaller than the water particles. Therefore, the fire particles can enter the water particles.\nExample: If you place a vessel filled with water on a stove, water gets heated. How and Why? Because we lit a fire and so it’s heated. Yet, isn’t there a layer of protection, the vessel, between the fire and the water? How did the fire particles get in there? We should know this. Even though the water particles are thinner than the vessel particles, because the vessel particles are strong, they do not pass through the vessel. However, fire particles are subtler than the vessel particles and are able to penetrate and make their way through the vessel particles. They then enter the water particles, ‘heating’ the water. What does it mean to heat them? The fire particles spread themselves in between the water. Therefore, it feels hot when touched. They gradually convert water into steam. As long as the vessel is on the stove, the process continues. When the vessel is taken off, the fire particles gradually leave as steam and the water cools down to normal temperature, without burning. What it means is that fire particles are more subtle than water and earth (vessel).\nThere are even thinner particles than that of fire. Air particles! That is why, when air penetrates accumulated fire, they spread and intensify the fire. Thus, we can deduce air particles are thinner than fire particles. Sky particles are even more subtler than air particles. Thus, the sky particles do not let air particles penetrate them, but they can in turn penetrate air. That is why they penetrate and stop the movement of air past a limit. All of this is a great process. A:thma is smaller than particles of earth, water, fire, air, and sky. Even sky particles cannot penetrate it. What can they do in that case? A:thma can penetrate them, but air cannot penetrate it. Because a:thma is smaller. Therefore, any substance made of earth, water, fire, air, or sky particles - none of them can affect a:thma. He thus declares the subtleness of a:thma in the 23rd verse. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a deep scripture as it illuminates an intricate topic, atma (soul) thathva (nature of the soul). If we want to know about it, we must have focus and interest as well as make an effort to think. This kind of scripture does not suit one who does not have focus and interest - one who simply thinks about and desires superficial things. For one who desires only superficial things, entering into this scripture is difficult and requires effort. Because Bhagavan Sri Krishna is the best Acharya (teacher), He is gracing us with the nectar of thought. He is discussing atma(s).\nHe speaks of the nature of atma starting in 2.23. He teaches us what is required for an object to destroy an atma. Atma is smaller/subtler than everything. Everything else is bigger than atma. Because it is smaller than everything, it can penetrate anything. Because everything else is bigger than atma, they cannot penetrate it. Because they cannot enter it, they can’t do anything to it. If there is a door that opens wide enough, we happily enter through it to the other side. We cannot do the same with a wall, can we? Why? Because we are larger than the particles of the wall, we cannot enter through them.\nAtma is smaller/subtler than everything. Because it is smaller than everything and it can penetrate through anything, it is vyapaka (pervasive). It can spread into anything, hence atma is named vyapaka. All other substances are vyapya (that which is pervaded). It is a technical term to identify them. Because atma is vyapaka, vyapyas cannot do anything to it. We discussed that atma can penetrate anything, but there is nothing that can penetrate it. \nWe know how to thread a needle. The needle has a tiny hole at one end. Only if a thread is thinner than that hole, it can be threaded. It is not possible to thread a rope into a needle hole because it is too thick. Because atma is smaller than everything, nothing can enter it. Atma does not get destroyed, as it does not let anything enter it. Sri Krishna clearly states this in two verses. The two verses seem to reiterate the same, but our acharyas (teachers) prove that it is not reiteration. Let’s look at verse 23 and 24.\nVerse 23…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnainam chhindanthi sasthrani: nainam dahathi pa:vakaha |\nna chainam kle:dayanthi a:paha na so:shayathi ma:ruthaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWeapons cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it, water cannot wet it, and air cannot dry it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWeapons do not have any ability to tamper with atma. As they are made from earth, they do not have the ability. How about elements like fire? Fire also does not have what it takes to penetrate atma. Fire also is not ‘strong’ enough to affect atma. When does a cloth get wet? Cloth is made of threads. Water is thinner than those threads. Hence when the water reaches between them, the cloth is said to get wet. When squeezed, some of the water leaves the cloth. Then, when dried in the Sun, the rest of the water is evaporated by the heat of the Sun. Heat means tejas (energy). Tejas penetrates through the water and converts it into vapor. The cloth remains as is. \nWater could penetrate the cloth to get it wet. Can water do the same with atma? Atma has no components. There is no way for something to penetrate it. Atma is smaller than everything, hence water cannot penetrate it. Water has no ability to do anything to atma. Water is of no use when it comes to atma. Physical elements, or fire, or water, cannot affect atma. How about air? Can air push the atma? No, it cannot. Why? If air particles can enter atma, then it can take the atma away. However, atma is smaller than air particles. They flow around the atma and move along, but cannot do anything to the atma. No external objects are powerful enough to bring any change to atma. \nHe explained the weakness of such objects in the first verse of this series [2.23]. In the second verse [2.24], He explains that based on atma’s nature, there is no chance for it to get destroyed by any object, leave aside the weakness of the objects to destroy it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nachche:dyo:yam ada:hyo:yam akle:dyo:yam aso:shyaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAtma cannot be cut, cannot be burned, cannot be made wet, and cannot be dried.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAtma does not have the quality of getting transformed. In the scenario of a leaf trying to cut the table, the leaf is not capable of cutting the table and the table is not of the nature to allow a leaf to cut it. Hence, one is the nature of the object and the other is the tool being used. Similarly, the two here… \nachche:dyaha (cannot be cut) - When can something be cut? When it is made of at least two parts and it gets broken into parts, it is called chedya (divisible into parts). However, atma is not a union of some parts. Hence, achche:dyaha. \nada:hyaha (cannot be burned) - Because it is impossible for atma to be penetrated by the tejo particles. \nakle:dyaha (cannot get wet) - When something must be made wet, water has to get into it. We all know what happens to water that is poured onto a cloth soaked in oil. Does water penetrate the oil-soaked cloth? If we do the same on a normal cloth, the water would have penetrated the cloth and we would say that the cloth got wet. If the cloth is covered with a layer of oil, does water then penetrate the cloth? No! Why? Because there is no chance for the water particles to penetrate the oil-soaked cloth, it does not get wet. Similarly, because atma is the most minute substance, it does not have a chance to let water enter it, and thus, cannot get wet. \nAlso, it cannot be pushed away by the air because atma does not have the quality of getting pushed away. Therefore, atma does not have the quality of getting affected by anything external and anything external has no ability to affect atma. One is atma’s incapability and another is the external object’s incapability. He is proving the two in two different verses. In the process, He explains the quality of atma as…\nnithyaha (eternal), sarvagathana (pervasive), stha:nuhu (firm), achalo:yam (unchanging), sanathana (eternal).\nSri Krishna is describing atma with wonderful adjectives. One of them is…\nnithyaha - exists eternally in all three planes of time, past, present, and future. It exists today, it existed the same way yesterday, and will continue to exist tomorrow. \nnithyaha, thrikaalika abadhyamu (unchanging entity in all three time planes, nothing that can change it). \nsarvagathaha - nothing can reach into it, but it can reach into everything. Because this can reach into everything, it lasts long. Because it will not let anything reach into it, it can last long. \nsarvagathaha - That is why it is known as vyapaka. Generally, vyapaka is that which pervades in many places and vyapya is that which pervades to lesser places. We must know what it means to pervade in many places or to pervade in lesser places. Atma can penetrate everything, so it is called sarva vyapaka. Sri Krishna is stating the same as sarva gathaha. Atma does not associate with any qualities of the object that it penetrates because they cannot penetrate into it. \nstha:nuhu - stays firm like an anu (smallest particle). Anu does not mean atom. Anu is that particle which is smaller than all else. There must be no other particle smaller than it. That which is indivisible is anu. Currently, science refers to it as Preon. That’s the name it’s been given - it is very small, the subtlest particle known to us in modern science as of today. Perhaps tomorrow, it will be split. Yet, atma will still be within it because it is anu, which cannot be split anymore. That which is no longer divisible is called anu. Sri Krishna declares that atma is like that, stha:nuhu. \nThere is another beautiful meaning to it. An iron tamper that is used for breaking iron. Generally, iron is heated red and then hit with a sledgehammer to break it. The tamper itself does not get affected at all. The base of the hammer stays unchanged without even a stain despite being used to break many things. Its base is called stha:nu. Atma is similar and an example is being used. Even if a changing object is upon it, it does not go through any transformation. To help us understand this, the base of the sledgehammer is given as an example. The base that doesn’t get affected when used in breaking iron is also called stha:nu. \nNot only that, it is also ayam sanathana (this is eternal). People are under the misconception that sanathana means that which is very old. People say dharma is sanathana. What does sanathana mean? Sanathana is that which always remains the same. sada: asthi, sanathana (that which always remains the same). Our habits, practices, scriptures, knowledge, etc. are always eternally the same. It’s not like the changing concepts of science which awards a Nobel prize for declaring something, and later awards another Nobel prize for disproving the same, and then again for disproving the disproof! Vedic literature always remains constant. Our dharma, Vedic knowledge, and the nature of atma are all constant. There is no question of which atma - mine, his, or someone else’s. All atmas are sanathana, always in the same form. They may change different bodies such as humans, animals, birds, insects, or trees, but their form will not change. Hence sanathana, the nature of atma is eternally unchangeable. \nSri Krishna is teaching this to Arjuna in 2.24.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nachche:dyo:yam, ada:hyo:yam, akle:dyo:yam, aso:shyaha,\nnithyaha, sarvagathaha, stha:nuhu, achalo:yam, sanathana\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAtma cannot be cut, cannot be burned, cannot be made wet, cannot be dried, is eternal, pervasive, firm, unchanging, and eternal.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAchalaha (cannot be moved) - If something has to be moved, you must hold and shake it. Atma is not in a form that can be moved. Sri Krishna is thus describing the nature of atma and urging Arjuna to quit his grief. Know about these and perform your duty. Let the results be anything. Encouraging him, Sri Krishna continues ahead with teaching this. Let us also try to learn it more clearly as we move ahead. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Human life is a battle, a battle between good and bad. It is a battle between dharma (righteousness) and adharma (unrighteousness). A battle between yuktha (fit) and ayuktha (unfit). In this battle, if one has a genuine desire to improve but encounters a dilemma in the choice of actions, Bhagavad Gita can provide an appropriate answer. This guidance is not limited to nation, race, time period, community, etc. It provides direction for any common person facing ambiguity about recommendations and restrictions, wrong and right ways of executing something. Using Arjuna as a means, Sri Krishna delivered Sri:mad Bhagavad Gita to give right answers to mankind for such ambiguities.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI bow repeatedly to Sri Rama, who is the remover of all obstacles and the giver of all wealth.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Yamuna Muni clarified this. As we perform our duties, we face many dilemmas and encounter many questions about whether it is appropriate to act one way or another or if it will hurt someone in the process, etc. Arjuna has the authority to rule the kingdom. The Pandavas earned the right to rule their kingdom after 13 years of exile and 1 year of living incognito. However, Duryodhana did not want to give it to them. In fact, Dhritarashtra was the king, but he gave all the authority to Duryodhana. Duryodhana made immature decisions, not realizing right versus wrong. However, Dhritarashtra approved all that.\nIn such a scenario, when a temporary owner is hesitating, not agreeing, and standing against you to give you back what was your right, your belonging, and worthy of your rulership, how should a good person and a well-wisher respond? How should he respond at the physical level, at the mental level? Sri Krishna felt the need to clarify both these aspects and thus delivered Bhagavad Gita.\nFirstly, what is the duty of a human being? A step back, who can be called a human being? We must know this first. We must then understand what responsibilities and duties mean, right? A human being has a physical body and an indwelling soul called ji:va (individual soul). This is what a human being is. Ji:va is given a body as a tool to complete his duty properly. Any responsible being would not walk away from his goal carried away by things related to the tool (body).\nArjuna knows his responsibility. What is his responsibility? To rule the kingdom as per dharma and remove any obstacles. What obstacle was he faced with? Out of affection towards ‘relatives’, he felt sorry for them and was in a dilemma if killing them would be a sin. He wondered if killing such people would also negate the state of higher worlds that they would attain otherwise. He questioned that such a state of higher worlds will not only be at stake for them but also for their ancestors. He felt that all of this would be sinful. Why commit a sin by waging this war? Instead, why can’t I give this up and beg for alms while somehow spending the rest of my life in a forest?\nTherefore, Sri Krishna had to clarify what one’s responsibility is toward the body and the self. A body is designed and given to a ji:va such that the accrued karma (actions) can be fulfilled. Therefore, one must perform the duties as per the given body. He was born in a dynasty that ruled the kingdom. His dharma was therefore to play his part and rule properly. In the process of exercising his duty in ruling, he must take essential action against those who are committing crimes against people, doing wrongful acts, etc. He must rule in a dharmic (righteous) way.\nThe Kauravas were those who did not tolerate good people. They poisoned those who encouraged good people, burnt their houses, tortured, and dishonored their families. They are people with such habits. Arjuna was then faced with the responsibility of eliminating such people. When his responsibility is to eliminate them, he was pondering if eliminating such people can be sinful.\nYou have a crop that is being eaten away by pests and grasshoppers. It is ready to yield in a few days, thus you must gather the harvest and send it home. Just about then, pests began to destroy it. If you feel sorry for the pests’ life, thinking it would be wrong and leave them, the crop that was planned to sustain many lives will be destroyed in a matter of a few minutes. What is his duty in such a situation? He worked hard from the outset to bring the crop to the yielding phase. As a result of the hard work, the crop is about to yield. Right at that moment, the pests attacked the crop. What must you do? Should you feel pity for the pests or should you protect the crop? If you protect the crop, you will meet the hunger needs of thousands of people. If you protect the pests, they would destroy ten other fields. What is your duty in such a situation? If someone is in this dilemma, what would you suggest? What direction will you give? Will you say, “Oh no! Don’t kill them, don’t spray any pesticides, leave them..!” No.\nWhy? The first among your duties is to protect the crop that gives food because you worked hard and long. Thus, you will make efforts to somehow eliminate the pests. This is what Sri Krishna tells Arjuna. You have the right to rule. Elders have given a good path to rule it properly. They instructed on the appropriate ways to conduct oneself [at all times]. They tread the same path. You are a descendant. In the earlier course of time, you had to face troubles because of what you and/or your brothers did. That troublesome situation has ended after 13 years, and you have regained the right to rule. However, they are opposing it and are not ready to give it back to you. What is your duty in this case? It is to eliminate those who are hindering you from taking back the kingdom that is lawfully yours. You must hence do what is necessary for that to happen.\nFirstly, they were verbally conveyed what is the right thing to do. No, they didn’t seem like ones who would listen. Next, they were warned. No, they didn’t care. The result is war alone! They all prepared for the war knowing that it was the only way. It is now all set. Everyone has come prepared.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npravrutthe: sasthra sampa:the:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAt the time when everyone is ready with their weaponry…\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou begin to feel sorry and pity for ‘relatives’ saying they are ‘your’ acharyas (teachers), father-like figures, child-like ones. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:cha:rya:ha pitharaha puthra:ha \nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is my grandfather, This is my acharya! How do I kill them?\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat do you mean by how? Don’t you see the ‘pests’ that are destroying the ‘crop’? You should not be seeing the body as one associated with relatives, but as a tool in exercising the atma’s (soul's) duty. You should use it only as a tool, but not be carried away with things that come with it. Your ‘sword’ and the opposing army men’s ‘swords’ are made of the same material. If you stop fighting because the other ‘swords’ are your ‘sword’s relatives, do you think they won’t attack and kill you? It (body) is a tool. Use it as one. The body must be used as a tool alone. You need not compromise on your duty to look after the relations that it brings. The others compromised on their duties. If you also compromise on your duty, you will also accrue a sin. Therefore, you must act on it. The grief you are feeling in taking action on them is not right.\nHe started explaining this at aso:chya:n anvaso:chaha (you grieve for those who should not be grieved for)…\nPerhaps for about 24 verses, he explained the same using various ways and different reasons. No matter what you do, a body will not be the same forever. No matter what you do, you cannot hurt an atma. Why? The body is of ever-changing nature. You have no control over the changes. The atma is so small, there is nothing smaller than that. There is nothing that can penetrate it to bring any change or cause any harm. He clarified the same in the previous two verses.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nacchedyaha, akle:dyaha, ada:hyaha, aso:shyaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is not something that can get wet, cut, dried, or burnt.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhy? Because it is smaller than the other object’s smallest constituent. There is nothing that can penetrate it, forget about destruction. Thus, it is ajaha (unborn), nithyaha (eternal), sa:svathaha (everlasting), pura:naha (ancient). He spelled it out clearly. He spelled out clearly about atma and body. He told Arjuna that he would accrue three sins if he quits the war.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nana:rya jushtam, asvargyam, aki:rthikaram\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFirst - ana:rya jushtam, Elders will not be happy about the decision of quitting the war.\n-----------------------------------------------\nElders will be happy if you follow the path set by them. The path they showed is to perform your duties. Your duty now is to fight the war. Hence they will be happy only if you fight the war now. He concludes the ana:rya jushtam aspect here. Sri Krishna moves ahead in the next three verses with an interesting way to reiterate the argument on why it’s not right to feel bad [for waging the war]. So far, we took simha:valo:kanam (intense overview), in the first instance, we heard it in a normal course. Then, we heard it at the pace of a quick review. We will move ahead with this strong foundation. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Every one experiences sorrow at one time or another. Sorrow means sadness. What causes sadness? When one is unable to gain clarity in the required knowledge, it leads to sadness. When one's knowledge is not granting him what he wants to attain, it leads to sadness. Perceiving that you lost something that you had attained also leads to sadness. Unnecessary challenges cause sadness too. Thus there are many reasons for the cause of sorrow.\nArjuna experienced sorrow, as explained in Bhagavad Gita (Bhagavad Gita), chapter 2. He desired to get over this sorrow but was unable to find a way. Sri Krishna began His advice to relieve Arjuna of his sorrow. At every instance He said ...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna:nu sochithum arhasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“It is inappropriate for you to be depressed this way. It isn’t correct for you to feel intensely sad.” said Krishna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere are two types of sorrows, so:ka and anuso:ka. So:ka is the general sorrow when faced with something unwanted, or when losing something he felt was his. That agony or anguish in the person is called so:kam. This so:kam disappears with elevated knowledge. Such knowledge, “tharathi so:kam a:thmavith” (the knower of the soul overcomes sorrow). If one can attain knowledge systematically, it naturally removes so:kam.\nSo what caused sorrow in Arjuna? The thought of killing his relatives and his gurus caused sorrow. They are relatives and gurus, but to what? It is the \"body\" that they are related to and the gurus of. What are they doing for the atma (soul)? If someone is being addressed, that includes atma too. What are they doing for it? Moreover, what is prominent, is it the atma or the body? Without the atma inside, a leftover seemingly healthy body still gets disposed of. On the other hand, as long as the atma is inside, a senile body is still being respected and cared for.\nSo what is important for us? The state of the body is not important. Instead, knowledge of nature and the cause of the indwelling conscious entity is important. This is to be clarified. Without realizing this and endlessly agonizing about objects associated with the body is called anuso:ka. The sorrow here isn’t just limited to one thing. It constantly moves onto additional related objects one after another. Arjuna is relating anything that is visible to such sorrow and grieving further. This is called anuso:ka.\n“If you realize this you will be able to get over your anuso:ka” … Bhagavan (Lord) thus advises in this wonderful sloka in the 2nd chapter. We are at the 25th sloka. He had, so far, given a few reasons. Now He is collating and concluding them to summarize comprehensively. What is the sloka?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\navyaktho::yam achinthyo::yam avika:ryo::yam uchyathe: |\nthasmad e:vam vidithvainam na:nu sochithum arhasi || 2.25\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“The soul is unmanifest, inconceivable, and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing this, you should not grieve.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nAvyakthaha (unmanifest), ayam (this) – He is now speaking about the qualities of atma (soul). Ayam refers to atma. It is avyakthaha, which cannot be seen. Achinthya:ha (inconceivable), the ayam (atma) is beyond anyone’s thoughts. Avika:ryaha (unchangeable) – vika:ram (change) means the atma cannot be subjected to change. These are the qualities of atma as per Lord Krishna. He gave 3 qualities - avyakthaha, achinthyaha, and avika:ryaha. Krishna says - “If you are able to comprehend these qualities thoroughly …\nthasmad e:vam vidithva\n… if you have learned about it this way …\nenam na anu sochithum arhasi\n… there is no reason to feel sad about anything.” Lord Krishna is answering Arjuna thus.\nThe first quality of atma He spoke about was that it is invisible (avyakthaha). The dilemma that Arjuna faced was – “Alas! These are all my relatives… if I kill them, they may go to either heaven or hell. Maybe we’ll go to hell. If they kill me instead, they will definitely go to hell.” Bodies remain lying here but he is saying something travels to hell. So he must have realized that there is an atma inside a body. He says he is going to kill others. But all he can see are the bodies of others. Since he is saying he is going to be doing something to the bodies, his focus is limited to the body. He did not seem to go further to decipher the underlying indwelling thaththva (truth) (atma) inside the body.\nSo, what needs to be done now? He needs to be given clarity about that [thaththva]. A common man can understand what a body is with just a bit of effort. That it is visible to the eye, with a skin tone that is in either black or white or red … and that its stature is small, tall, thin, or fat. This is a typical form of a body that is visible. Other features are not easily visible. But the above can be seen clearly. These are not just limited to humans but can be seen in animals, birds, cattle, and many objects in nature. So all these can be seen.\nBut speaking of atma, He says - avyaktho: ayam (this is unmanifest). The atma is avyakthaha – it cannot be seen. Achinthyo:yam (this is inconceivable) – it cannot be understood even with the mind (manas). Vyakthamu refers to the objects that can be perceived with external sensory organs. Avyakthamu refers to anything that cannot be perceived with those sense organs. Every object is composed of pancha bhu:thas (five physical elements), which can be perceived with our senses. When they (objects) are in their gross form, they can be experienced. However, when they take the subtle form, they cannot be felt.\nBig mountains and hills can be seen. When their rocks are pulverized, the resulting dust particles spread throughout the atmosphere are not clearly visible. They can only be seen when they reach a certain size or form. Can we see the tiny dust particles that are swirling around us in the atmosphere? They are also made up of the five physical elements. Nevertheless, we wouldn’t know that they are around us. It requires a certain technique to view them. The table we sit at gathers dust all the time. When we run our hand across it, we can see the dust on our hands. That dust settled on it after moving around in the air. While it’s in the air, however, we do not realize its presence. Could we claim that it doesn’t exist in the air because we cannot see it at that time? We cannot do that.\nThere are many objects around which our naked eyes lack the ability to see. When we are given powerful vision glasses or when observed under a microscope… we then realize that these particles indeed exist in a physical form! It means when the instruments we possess are not powerful enough to view them or… if the objects do not have the characteristic of being visible to the eyes, then we cannot see them under normal circumstances. Such objects are called vyaktha (manifest) objects. However, we do have certain sensory organs to perceive them. To make out the shape we have eyes, to hear a sound we possess ears. Nose exists to be able to smell, tongue exists for the taste, and with skin we can perceive the touch. These five organs exist. The objects can be perceived whether the body is in the gross form or in the subtle form. Sometimes they need instruments like a lens or need to be enlarged or need great vision. They can be seen if the sensory organs are functional; otherwise, they cannot be seen.\nHowever, if the organs are functional, these objects can be seen. Those objects that are qualified to be perceived by the sense organs are called vyakthas. Atma is not eligible to be perceived by those sensory organs which can sense the objects made of the pancha bhu:thas. It is therefore called ‘avyaktham’ (unmanifest). This is not something we claim but instead was put forth in Mahabharata as….\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nIndriyaihi gruhyathe: yath yath \nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Whichever is qualified to be perceived by the sensory organs, whether it is in subtle or gross form … it is considered qualified even if it can be magnified with instruments such as a powerful telescope and then perceived.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe qualification that these possess enables them to be seen. Such capability is lacking in atma. Atma is therefore called avyaktham. avyaktho:yam (this is unmanifest) ayam avyaktha ha (this is unmanifest) – something that’s beyond the capacity of sense organs. As discussed before… linga gra:hyam athi:ndriyam, states Bharata’s Shanti Parva (peace section) that which cannot be perceived by sensory organs.\nOne may wonder, ‘If it cannot be perceived in any way, how can we accept that it exists?’ That’s not what it means. Senses cannot perceive it, but its existence can be established by some other means such as scripture (shastra). There are only two other ways [excluding sensory perception], inference or scripture. Perceiving by inference is called lingam. There is a chance that it can be perceived with that or with the help of a scripture. This is what atma has.\nIn order to explain the same, earlier Lord Krishna used the words – achche:dyaha (indestructible), ada:hyaha (cannot be burned), akle:dyaha (cannot be dried), aso:chyaha (not worthy of grief). Here He wanted to further clarify atma's differentiating qualities using the terms such as avyaktho:yam (this is unmanifest). This is avyakthamu. It cannot be perceived by the senses that can make out external objects. Can this be inferred? There are a few that the senses cannot make out but can be inferred. The presence of smoke implies there is a fire nearby. We can guess the object based on the sound it makes. A person can be recognized by listening to their voice. Is it possible to infer [atma] through such ways? Atma cannot be inferred, achinthyo:yam (this is inconceivable). Chinthana means an activity carried out in manasu (mind), an internal sense organ. Achinthyaha, it is not possible to be inferred.\nNot only that, it is also avika:ryaha (unchangeable). Any object that is perceived by the senses undergoes changes. Even those we recognize through inference also undergo transformations. We recognize fire when smoke is seen. Such [inferred] fire is capable of transformation. The indwelling atma does not go through changes even like an inferred object would undergo. So why worry about it?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\navika:ryaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“When you understand this”, [Lord Krishna says] “It is futile for you to feel the sorrow.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat needs to be done? e:vam vidithva e:nam (having learned this) Learn first. Like an ignorant person, why do you think that when the body falls that you are killing Bhishma, Drona, and others? You cannot think like that. Your duty now is to wage war against them according to your dharma (duty) and regain your kingdom. Therefore, orient yourself towards duty. It is not appropriate for you to back off from your duty. Get over the sorrow that could hamper it [your ability to do your duty]. You are not realizing where the sorrow is leading you to. It is not ending at Bhishma or Drona or other individuals. It is extending to their relatives and further on. This is anuso:kam.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna:nu sochithum arhasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nLord Krishna says to Arjuna that there is no need to feel the sorrow now. Your appropriate duty now is to wage the war with a firm mind. This duty will become a:ryajushtam (one that pleases the Elders). Therefore get up! [Lord Krishna] He, Sri Krishna, was getting him prepared for the war, thus orienting him [Arjuna] towards his duty.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a spiritual science, physical science, and a logical science. It is also scientific and a psychological science that transforms the nature of a person and motivates him to do his duty. The Lord ensured Bhagavad Gita can be used in many different ways. That is why Bhagavad Gita remains a standard even today after thousands of years.\nWe are trying to learn about it in a stha:li pula:ka ny:aya (inferring the whole by understanding a few parts). This scripture is also related to nya:ya (laws and rules), meaning it is a logical scripture. They clarify a subject, tell why, the reason behind it, and provide an example for it. They gave them a few names like paksha (aspect), he:thuvu (reason), and drushta:ntha (example).\nTo alleviate Arjuna from sorrow and inspire him to do his duty, Lord Krishna is clarifying a:thma (soul) thatthva (truth) jnana (knowledge) and the qualities of this body. Our Elders never did anything according to their discretion. We can do so in regards to things that are visible. For example, fruit is visible. If it has germs on it, we know not to eat it. Recently, they showed somewhere that as they peeled the skin of an orange, it had hundreds of germs. Even those who eat meat don’t feel like eating it when they see it. They feel disgusted and can’t eat it when they see it like that.\nBecause this is clearly visible, we can avoid it by concluding that it is not good for us. But telling about the things that are invisible like the chaithanya (awareness), or jna:na (knowledge) or knowledge possessing a:thma (soul) is very difficult. In fact, we are unable to understand even if we are told about those things that are visible. We are unable to see viruses. But some folks who were able to see it drew it like a ball. They put a few thorns on it and called it ‘coronavirus’. They said it is so dangerous, it will damage your taste and smell, make you fatigued, make you sick, and take your life.\nWhat do we do then? Try not to get it. How? Follow three precautions to avoid getting it:\n1. Wash your hands\n2. Wear masks, don’t touch your mouth or nose\n3. Maintain at least a 6 ft distance between one person and the other\nHow many people are following this today? We wear a mask half-heartedly because we are supposed to wear it, pulling it up and down, touching everywhere though we are advised not to touch it. We wear it just for the satisfaction of the people who are advising us. They ask us to wash our hands frequently for sanitization. As we cannot see that part, let’s leave that topic. We are advised to wash our hands if we touch anything. We are touching everything, not sure how many times we are washing our hands. It is advised that we maintain a 6 ft distance between people. Wherever we look, people are in crowds close to each other.\nWe are not saying this to criticize someone. This is about something we can see. We are told the consequences for it. We are seeing our friends or relatives falling prey to it, still, we are not willing to follow the precautions. This is something we can see. Now to tell a person about something which we can’t see, a:thma (soul), and make him follow some rules, how difficult would it be? In how many different ways should that person be told?\nOne more irony is that all these rules (for corona) are for a particular sect of people who they feel are subordinates and can be easily ordered! The ones who can be easily ordered are schools and students. They said schools must be closed, and to send students home. If possible, teach them online; it doesn’t matter whether they learn something or not. Why? It is because of them, lives are being endangered, the virus is spreading, etc.\nWhat we have to think about is opening hotels and eating places next to garbage… and when people eat in such polluted and dirty places, there is no restriction on them. They are not being shut down nor are they advised not to eat in such places. Those are being kept open, and theatres are kept open. But small children and their education were made scapegoats. We don’t understand the purpose of this.\nAll these we are able to see, still, it is so difficult to make people follow the rules. But we don’t see a:thma (soul), jnana (knowledge), or dharma (right practices). To make people follow some rules naturally in regards to them, we can understand how much more difficult that would be. When we hear Sri Krishna’s words in Bhagavad Gita, we may feel why He is saying the same thing so many times repeatedly. The Lord is not saying the same thing; there will be something different each time He says it. The question is, will we be able to recognize the difference or not?\nIf we have sincere interest and pay attention to it, then we can definitely grasp the meaning of it. Sri Krishna says that being ignorant of soul-related knowledge, if you stop performing actions, learned people will not appreciate it. Learned people are jna:nis (wise individuals); they gave us a set of rules regarding how one should behave. We may like some, and we may find a few difficult. A few of them may appear to be benefiting us, while a few may appear to be causing us loss. But what it does to you individually doesn’t matter (whether it gives you gain or loss, whether you like it or dislike), but what society needs is more important.\nWhat is beneficial to the general mass of the population, which needs to be told, that is what Krishna does in Bhagavad Gita. If you enforce a ‘lockdown’, personally it is a great inconvenience and causes losses to an individual, but because it is good for society at large, are we not saying that it is good to follow it? This is related to a very small issue in the visible spectrum. A:thma (soul) is quite inscrutable. That thaththva (truth), the supreme entity responsible for the existence of our bodies. To make someone get the right perspective about it is so difficult. But once we know about it, we will become blissful. We will be able to live in the manner and walk in the path taught by our Elders/learned people, and they will be happy to see our progress. We can become a:ryajushta:s (noble persons).\nKrishna is telling Arjuna, \"What you are about to do is ana:rya jushta (ignoble), so don’t do it.\" Why? In verse 2.25, Krishna says a:thma (soul) is avika:ryo (unchangeable). An interesting aspect here… Avika:ra means one which cannot change. He could have just used avika:ra. Instead of saying avika:ra, He said avikarya:ha, he added ya:h in the end. Why did He do that? To say that it doesn’t have the capability to undergo any change. Every object has some (inherent) capabilities. A betel leaf doesn’t have the capability to cut wood. A knife, sword, or axe may have that capability. You can’t take a betel leaf and try to cut a stone or wood. The leaf doesn’t have the capability to cut, and the stone or wood doesn’t have the capability to be cut by it.\nWe have discussed these two in the previous verse related to acchedya:ha (indestructible) and the verse before it. Here also, the Lord is saying in the same way; a:thma (soul) is avika:ryaha (unchangeable). What it means is that the soul is not capable of it. He is explaining it through a good anuma:na (inference). A:thma is avika:ryaha, soul is that which is not capable of undergoing any change. Why? Because it is avyakthathva:th (not a visible entity). Why? It is like I:shwara thatthva (supreme entity God). He gave a suitable example to clarify that.\nWhat about the body? Sarira (body) is vika:ryaha (changeable), undergoes changes. There is no doubt about this. In yesteryears, we were different; today we look different. Someone who was a young boy a few years back has become old today. We ourselves can see this change. Hence, the body is vika:rya:ha (changeable); it undergoes change and has the capacity to change. As the body is vyakthathva:th (visible), this visibility makes something capable of change. Ghatavath (like a pot).\nSri Krishna says a:thma is avyaktho:ya (invisible), achhinthyo:ya (unimaginable), avika:ryoyamuchyathe (unchangeable). Because of the above reasons, thasma:d e:va vidithva: e:nam (therefore, whoever knows this clearly) has no reason to cry - na:nu so:chithuma:rhasi (there is no need to cry). There is no need to cry for souls or bodies, whoever it might be, it might be yours, Bhi:shma’s, Dro:na’s, or anyone else’s. Krishna is making an effort to alleviate Arjuna’s sorrow by talking about the qualities of body and soul. The Lord also makes it clear that it is explained by Elders. He says that he need not listen to it just because He is explaining it. I am stating that which is declared in sa:sthra (scriptures). The same is explained by Elders. I am teaching the same which is approved by Elders.\nRegarding what is invisible, we have to believe what they say. If one day you see that thaththva (truth), supreme truth, and if it negates this, maybe then you need not follow it, but till then you have to follow it. Saying that, Sri Krishna is inspiring Arjuna to wage the war and proceeds further to explain the same in a different way. Jai Srimannarayana! Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), today we delve into the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita as presented by HH Chinna Jeeyar Swami. In this episode, we explore the concepts of belief in the Vedas and the nature of existence.\nA:sthikas (theists) are those who believe in the Vedas. Those who don’t accept the Vedas are called na:sthikas (atheists), as they claim it is na:sthi (non-existent). \nasanne:vasa bhavathi asath bramhe:thi ve:dache:th\nasthi bramhe:thiche:th ve:da santhame:nanthatho: vidurithi:\nBramha (Veda) has many meanings, including nature, body, mind, atma (soul), or parama:thma (supreme soul). In this context, Bramha refers to the Veda. Whoever says ‘asath bramha ithi ve:da che:th’ (I don’t believe in the Vedas) becomes asath (non-existent) - asanne:vasa bhavathi. \nThose who believe in the Vedas are a:sthikas. Some people stress the sound ‘th’ and call it a:stthikas, which is incorrect as it means someone who has bones. We are all a:stthikas since we have bones, as a:stthi means bones. Whereas asthi means something that exists.\nOnly those who believe in the Vedas accept the existence of an indwelling and pervading thatthva (principle) and its supporting supreme thatthva as stated in the Vedas. They accept the existence and paths to the worlds beyond this visible world, such as swarga (heaven) and Vaikunta. Those without faith in the Vedas do not believe in their existence as they cannot be seen. \nHe who only believes in what can be seen is na:sthika. The one who believes in what is based on a prama:na (means of attaining accurate knowledge) despite not having a visual cue is a:sthika. \nArjuna might have become vexed, which is why he scrunched his face as if irritated. Arjuna said, “Since You said there is something called a:thma, you are asking me to accept all these things. I don’t want this chaos. I won’t even accept the existence of a:thma. What will You say now? Whatever is visible - this body is ‘me’. I am not in the body; I am the body. Whatever is visible, I will only accept that. I won’t accept other things. Since whatever I am seeing will perish now, shouldn’t I cry for it?”\nIt appears as though Arjuna is trying to defend his grief instead of thinking of his duty. That’s the irony. Krishna is the one who knows everything and how to give the right response to everyone. \nKrishna asked, “So what are You saying now?” Arjuna replied, “I don’t believe in a:thma; I only believe in the body. Since You are asking me to wage war, I will wage it. But all these bodies will perish then. Or if I become a victim to their arrows, I might perish. They may die or I may die. How can I not cry about it?”\nSri Krishna understood Arjuna's heart and wanted to respond. For that, Krishna chose to explain the answer in three verses: 2.26, 2.27, and 2.28. \nLord Krishna responds to those who don’t believe that the soul and body are separate and who only believe in the visible body. Even for such na:sthikas, if they have to do something like this, there is no need to cry.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthadha:pithvam maha:baho naivam so:chithum a:rhasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, O mighty-armed one, you should not lament.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKrishna said, “You might ask why a na:sthika wouldn’t feel like crying if he is losing his kin.” Krishna is changing the context here. Until now, He was addressing those who accepted that the soul and body are separate. \nThe whole Bhagavad Gita is for such people as it is the essence of the Upanishads. Upanishads are part of the Vedas. When He speaks of the essence of those parts of the Vedas, it implies He is speaking of the Vedas. \nHowever, the unique aspect of the Gita is that it also accepts those who don’t believe in the Vedas and responds to them. They (na:sthikas) are also children of God. It is His desire to bring them to the good path. Hence, He tries to clear their doubts too. \nThat is why the Lord is slightly changing the context here as if He is talking to them. There is beauty in the Sanskrit language; it indicates the change of context through a word. \nIf they want to change the context, they will separate it with a word. If they start with ‘adha’ - it indicates a new context. Similarly, if the letter ‘thu’ appears after a word, it separates that word from the previous context. \nFor example, “Ramaha vanam gathava:n, lakshmanasthu…” means Rama went into the forest. Since we said lakshmanasthu, it doesn’t belong to the context of where Rama was going. \nWhen we say “however,” it means it is different from the previous action. Similarly, if the word ‘thu’ comes at the end of a word, it separates that word from the previous context. \nIf ‘adha’ comes at the beginning, it changes the context from there. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nadha chai:nam nithya ja:tham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBut you think that this is born and dies.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKrishna continued, “Hey Arjuna! E:nam nithya ja:tham nithya mrutham manyase: (You think this is born and dies). Nithya ja:tham (something which is always being born) and nithya mrutham (something which always dies) refer to all objects we see. They leave the old form and take a new form. \nWhen they leave the old form, we say it died. If it takes a new form, we say it is born. It is the same definition for birth and death. If the definition is the same, how can we know if they came into the world or left the world? How do we know if it is auspicious (birth) or not?\nKrishna said, “You are saying that whatever you are seeing is a:thma; I am talking to those who only believe in what they see - the body. For them, birth and death are one. How? It just means leaving the old form and taking a new form. This definition is the same for birth and death.”\nWhen we say someone is born, he is moving his hands and legs. Here we are not talking about a:thma. Don’t think that a:thma is there. Think that whatever is visible is a:thma - i.e., the body. That is only moving and working. \nAs a mixture of nature's elements, a chaitanya (consciousness) came into it. For example, in ‘paan’ (betel leaf) - when you eat a betel leaf along with lime and supa:ri (areca nut), you see a red color which was not there before. \nWe can see the red color, and it is called ‘tha:mbula’. There is no red color in betel leaf, supa:ri, or lime, but something new comes with their combination. Similarly, with the combination of bhu:thas (elements) - there are only four bhu:thas: earth, water, fire, and air. Space is not there as it can’t be seen.\nWith the combination of these in some proportions, a new chaitanya (consciousness) is formed, which is responsible for eating, working, talking, etc. If there is a change in those proportions, we say it died. If there is another type of change in proportions, we say it got sick. When it gets better, we say it is healthy. If the change is bigger, then the chaitanya goes, and we call it death.\nWhat does it mean by death here? The bhu:thas are still there. Fire, air, water, and earth are there as they were. But there is a change in the proportions of bhu:thas. It is the same for birth also. Even after changing, these elements are still there.\nWhen a plant emerges from a seed, some elements are ‘added in’. When it produces a fruit, some elements are ‘pushed out’. These elements were not visible earlier but became visible now. Those fruits, flowers, and leaves then fall down to the earth. \nThey change their form and become manure, which in turn goes into the making of plants. If a leaf gets old and falls off, we say the leaf has died. If a new shoot comes out, we say it is born. Nothing new is being born here; nothing old is dying here. Whatever is there has changed into a new form.\nThe leaf falls down and becomes manure. Manure then becomes part of the plant again. The plant becomes a leaf again. It is a recycling process; they keep changing forms. When they take a new form, it is called birth. When they lose their old form, since we can’t see it, it is named death. This can be applied to everything.\nOur elders called this sathka:rya va:da (theory of transformation). Whatever is already existing will take new forms. \nArjuna said, “I will not accept the existence of ji:va (soul); I will only accept the existence of the body. This is changing forms; it is made of only four elements (earth, water, air, and fire). Since it is changing form, won’t I feel sad about it?” \nWhen you see an object in some form and if it changes its form, do we say it’s gone? When a leaf falls, a fruit ripens, or a bud blooms changing its forms, do we cry for it saying that the bud has died and a new flower has been born? No, we feel happy about it. \nThen why should we cry if a body changes form? It was formed with a combination of elements. While in that form, you did your duty. After that, there was a change in proportions. This change is natural. If you stop it, this change is not going to stop. \nThe body didn’t come into existence because of you. Let’s look at our body. No one wants to get old. But can anyone stop it? No. Can you stop a seed from becoming a sapling? Change is inevitable for everything in nature. You can't stop it. So why cry about it? Whatever is happening naturally, just witness it, be happy about it, and do what you need to do. No need to worry.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthada:pithvam maha:baho naivam so:chithum a:rhasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, O mighty-armed one, you should not lament.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna is saying that even for na:sthikas, there is no need to cry as change is inevitable. He is helping Arjuna understand that there is no need to cry for the changes that will come with the war. \nLet’s proceed further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Hearing the word ‘Bhagavad Gita’, we recall a wonderful verse. It is verse 2.27.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nja:thasya hii dhruvo mruthyuhu dhruvam janma mruthasya cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever is born will die, and whoever dies will take birth again.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is one verse. It is a very well-known verse. Many people know it by heart. But somehow it doesn’t sound right. It is also a dangerous verse. Because half of it is good and we can understand it whereas when you think of the other half, it scares you. How?\nja:thasya hi (whoever takes birth) - mruthyuhu (death) - dhruvaha (is inevitable). Lord is using the word ‘hii’ to indicate that everyone in the world knows it, meaning it’s popular. Meaning it is well known. Whatever is born has to die for sure. Everyone knows this, where is the need to doubt it? We don't need any scripture for this. But the other half is a big question which is difficult to comprehend. \ndhruvam janma mruthasya cha (Whatever is gone or dead will take birth again for sure). That's the scary part. There is no place in this world for those newly born. As people keep passing away, we thought there will be some space for newly born. But now, if there is rebirth of those who were gone, where is the space to accommodate them on this earth?\nSomeone said we have a 700 billion population on this planet. This is a lot and shouldn’t be the case. We need to get it below 500 billion. That someone said that they created an engineered virus for that sake. So the poor guy wanted to reduce it by 200 billion. But all his efforts turned out to be useless because of great scientists in India. Our folks found a vaccination for that virus. They inspired people to take different precautions against it. We were able to protect our people from falling prey to the virus and whoever created it was able to save their people too. But the rest of the world became scapegoats. Whoever was destined to go passed away. But however hard they worked, they couldn’t do a lot of damage.\nAfter working so hard to cut down the population, those dead are taking birth again, how challenging is the earth!? Today there are people who kill lakhs of beings per day for food, fun, business or for other purposes. They could be killing human beings, animals, insects or bacteria. Forget about the beings like bacteria or microorganisms which can’t be seen. Creatures which can be seen, sea creatures like fish or those on the land like hens, pigs… dogs, foxes and many more. All these are killed for business or other purposes, what if all of them take birth again?\ndhruvam janma mruthasya cha (all of them have to take birth for sure). If all of them take birth again, what will happen to those folks? If it sees those who killed it, wouldn’t it go after them? Are we able to see the rebirth of the same creatures? No. So, should we say what Krishna said was right or not?\nthasma:th apariha:rye a:rthe (in the context of this fact which leaves no scope for anyone to stop or control) na thvam so:chithum arhasi (no need for you to cry in this matter). “Arjuna! Whoever is born will die and whoever dies will take birth.” He said this!\nWe have to remember one thing. Who is Krishna’s targeted audience when explaining verse 2.27? This verse is intended for an atheist, not for a theist. Earlier, we discussed that verses 2.26, 2.27, and 2.28 go a bit out of context for the sake of those who don’t believe in Vedas. Sri Krishna made the argument [in those verses] solely to state that even such people don’t need to cry.\nThese three verses are not meant for those who believe in God’s existence or who know the difference between atma (soul) and deha (body). They are only meant for those who believe in nature alone. If we observe nature, none of the constituent elements get destroyed. They only change their forms. In earlier days, if they had to identify a region, they would identify it with reference to the mountains and rivers there. But now we all know that the mountains are being leveled to build buildings or form roads by blasting them to pieces. Mountains are being flattened. We all know about the rivers. Rivers are drying up. Rivers are being diverted to new paths. So, how can we have rivers and mountains as landmarks? They are ‘changing forms’ means that they are ‘getting destroyed’. Does it mean they are ‘vanishing’? No. They are changing their forms.\nWhatever was tall and high is being flattened to make various parts for constructing a highway. Nothing happened to it. It was tall and high so it was called a mountain. Now, it has become flat and spread to a larger area and is called a highway. Any object in nature undergoes a change in its form but doesn’t lose its existence. Roads, and buildings are destroyed, pits are dug, and the resulting material is dumped at a place. A mountain was formed at that place. Did the mountain take birth there? Did the ground die where they took the sand out? Yes! According to one definition, it is true. The old form has changed into a new form. If the old form has been changed, it is called death. If the new form comes into existence, it is called birth. Birth and death are changes of forms, not the emergence of something that did not exist.\nIt is called sathkarya vada (the theory of transformation) in one sense. Whatever exists already will take a form, something new will not emerge. It’s not true that something will emerge from nowhere. Veda questions, kadham asathas sajja:ye:tha? Chhandogya Upanishad says: \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsathve:va so:mya idam agra a:si:th e:kame:va adhvi:thi:yam.\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is something that is always there. Forms keep changing.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen the old form goes, we say it died. When a new form comes, we say it took birth. Let’s say we got some vegetables and placed them there. One guy cut them into pieces, prepared a delicious dish, and served it to everyone. Everyone ate it. Can we say that all vegetables have died? We can say that. Because we are not able to see them. But did they vanish from everywhere? No. They all have changed their forms and went into everyone's stomachs. If they have gone into their stomachs, shouldn’t their stomachs become big? What happened to it gradually after that? Some of it got digested in the stomach, whatever needed to be in the body stayed there, the rest of it went outside the body. Whatever went out that way, shouldn’t it be there somewhere in heaps? That turned into manure for plants. Then, we should be able to see it there at least, right? From roots, it went to stems and from there to leaves, from leaves to flowers and flowers it went to fruits. The fruits have become big mangoes and then become nice juices. What happened then? These juices came back to the same person and he enjoyed the juices. Same process repeats again. Same thing happens everywhere in nature.\nWe have to remember who this is being told for. Verses 2.26, 2.27, 2.28 were told only for the one who believes only in the elements he sees. This upadesha (teaching) was for him. Krishna wanted to summarize in these verses that even such a person doesn’t need to cry. Not just for a:sthika (theist) but for na:sthika (atheist) also, there is no need to cry while discharging your duty. For one who is performing his/her duty there is no need to cry. Lord had to say this. Why? No one can control these changes. Can you stop leaves from coming out of a stem? You can’t do it. Can you stop the leaf from getting old or a fruit from coming out? Can you stop a fruit from ripening or a leaf from falling? You can’t do that. If you burn the leaf to ashes, it will become manure and get recycled to the plants. In the whole world, the same thing goes on.\nWe have discussed this many times in the past, not a particle of sand or a drop of water goes out of the earth planet we live in. Nothing comes into our planet from other planets, unless he goes in a rocket and gets something from there. We have sent people to Mars or the Moon. Someone might get it from there. Someone might take it from earth and drop it on other planets. Unless someone does that, nothing goes out from this planet naturally. Oceans are full of water. It becomes vapor because of the sun, forms clouds and falls as rain. If the rain falls somewhere else, it forms rivers separating into streams. From dams, water comes through pipes into houses, it then flows out from taps and is consumed by man. From man's body, it comes out as perspiration and urine reaching into the earth. And from earth, it is absorbed and reaches the same ocean. The drops of water which came from the ocean will reach the ocean again this way. They go through many changes in the process. As they change, they lose their old form and take on a new form. When the form changes, its name also changes. Once the name changes, its function also changes. When water is in a river, its function is different, when it comes into a tap or bottle its function changes… and when it reaches the stomach, its function might be different. Once it comes out of the body it might have a different function. If it comes out of humans, nothing is done. But if it comes out of cows, it is used for medicinal purposes. Waste from other creatures also might be used for medicines, we don’t know. We don’t know where the medicines we are given are coming from. If it is packaged nicely as a strip of medicine, we purchase it and consume it. We don’t know from where and how it was prepared.\nWhat is the summary? In this world, nothing new takes birth or dies but goes through changes in state. Forms, names and functions change. That's all. Can you control it? No. Can you control water in the oceans from getting vaporized, forming clouds and falling as rain? Then why cry for them? Can you stop the movement of the sun? No. Then why cry for them? Can you stop the plants from growing and the leaves from falling to the ground? No. These are some beings. Human beings are also one of them. The same applies for him. Gradually he also goes through changes. When you are here, you have to do your specific duties. Trees are doing their job, animals and birds are doing their job, same with insects. So you also do your duty as a human, perform your duty. Who is Lord telling this for? Sri Krishna is saying this for someone who doesn’t believe in the soul and believes only in nature, for someone who believes only in that the body is made of nature.\ndhruvam janma mruthasya (whoever dies has to take birth again). The fruit which was gone from the tree takes birth as curry which is consumed by humans which becomes waste, it turns into manure and then fruit and comes back to you. Therefore…\ndhruvam janma mruthasya (This is natural, it is everywhere in nature and is inevitable). No one can control this. Why cry for that? As long as you are here, do your duty. Now your duty [Arjuna] is to control all those people here. Do that! Instead, why are you crying?\nthasma:d apariha:ra;rye:rthe na thvam so:chithu marhasi (Don’t cry like a weakling for this). Get up and do your duty. Motivating Arjuna for the war, Krishna is inspiring us to do our duty in the second chapter. Let us move forward doing our duty. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In this world, people believe in various ways. Some believe in what is seen, while others believe only in the unseen. Some lead life coordinating both the seen and unseen. A few live believing in prama:na (authoritative source of knowledge), whereas others think that prama:na are not necessary in life. Some people want to follow the footsteps of the wise, while others prefer to live freestyle, driven by their hearts, not bound by the wise or anyone else. \nDifferent types! Some want to lead their life without hurting anyone, but some aim to live only for their own happiness, regardless of what happens to others. Humans are of diverse types. Irrespective of the type of person, fulfilling duties is absolutely essential. It doesn’t matter what you believe in; it’s mandatory for everyone to act upon their duties. Nobody should shirk their responsibilities. \nWhat is the common duty for anyone? Taking good care of the body for as long as it exists. This also applies to those believing in three remarkable entities: de:ha (body), a:thma (soul), and parama:thma (God). It also applies to one who believes in de:ha and an a:thma that pervades through the body. The same applies for one who believes in nothing other than de:ha and considers it to be a:thma and parama:thma too! For as long as it lasts, nurturing this body is essential for anyone.\nIn order to nurture it, one needs to earn. To earn, one needs to work. To work, one must learn the work. To learn that, one needs to study. To study, one needs to approach someone who can teach. To whom one needs to pay accordingly. To pay, one needs to earn again, or someone must donate to us, or we must borrow from someone. This is a cycle. Life is a ‘cycle’. \nAs you go through the cycle of life, if you don’t become a trouble for others and take care such that you don’t get troubled by others, then your life is considered a good one. If you make it miserable for yourself and for those around you, it’s not considered worthy to talk about. What should we do to make it good? We must follow in the path of the experienced people. Sri Krishna named the path of the experienced people as a:rya jushtamu (the path of the noble). He says, “Practice ‘a:rya jushtam’. Please such a:ryas (noble people)…”\nWe must recall from our previous sessions about who A:ryas are. However, the effect of certain words is imprinted in us in various ways. Thus, it causes misunderstanding the instant we hear the word. A:ryas are not those A:ryas or Dravidians that we need here. A:ryas are those who acknowledge the past, think about the future, and ensure that the present is in good coordination with them, not causing conflict, and live their life in an appreciable way, living for society. They are A:ryas. Others who are not that way are called ‘ana:ryas’ (non-noble). \nOnly the people whose way of life is appreciated by everyone will be respected in society. The world honors and welcomes such people. We too should lead such a life. There were times when the whole society was full of A:ryas. If we ever crossed boundaries, this society would try to redirect us back to the right path. In fact, this is why rulers took charge. That is also why danda ni:thi (penal policy) came into place. Kauravas deserved punishment as they transgressed from the path, whereas Pa:ndava:s (the Pandavas), walking the advised path, were well regarded and accepted by the wise. \nPa:ndava:s were therefore in a position to implement punishment. However, despite being in a position to implement, if they hesitate and are consumed by various doubts, then it becomes essential to apprise and orient them towards their duty. This is what Sri Krishna does. For example, let’s say a man was employed as thala:ri (executioner). Assuming you all know who a thala:ri is, he is one who executes the death sentence ordered by the court to a convicted person. \nThat is the job he was employed in. What is his duty? If someone is sent for punishment, he should implement the task without any hesitation. He should not be in a dilemma, wondering if he should do it and worrying that it is violence. If he entertains such thoughts, he is not even suitable for that job. If he does his job, will he not get any pa:pa (bad karma), the result of a bad action? Certainly not. When one is on duty and implementing the rules of the job he was appointed to, he does not attain any pa:pa and it does not implicate him in any kind of guilt. \nAs Arjuna was in such a state and hesitant to implement it, he had to be given an upade:sa (teaching). In that process, Bhagava:n Sri Krishna felt it appropriate to address questions of all types of people, including believers of prama:na, Ve:das (Vedas). They should neither grieve nor become overly ecstatic, jumping up and down while they perform their duties. Neither of the two! One need not feel ecstatic and claim credit because results are favorable or resort to self-blame, get depressed, and grieve when results are unfavorable. \nTo summarize, both theists and atheists need not grieve at all. To explain that even an atheist need not grieve in such a situation, Sri Krishna gave the three verses 2.26, 2.27, and 2.28.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nja:thasya hi dhruvo: mruthyuhu, dhruvam janma mruthasya cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Anyone born will eventually die. Anyone dead will take birth again.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThat triggers a huge doubt. “Anyone born will die.” This is fairly straightforward as we see it happening around us. However, when we hear \"Anyone who dies will take birth again,\" it makes us wonder how one takes birth again. Let’s say a person with a villainous nature dies. People around him thank their stars that this wicked man is finally gone for good. They want to just finish the funeral and be done with it. If they see him come to life all of a sudden, imagine their horror! Alternatively, if he takes life in some other form as soon as the burial process is over, he will then need to be named differently! \nIf the phrase ‘anyone who has died must be reborn’ means one takes birth in this way, we would call him a ghost, demon, or evil spirit. We cannot even predict what and how he would act! So what is Sri Krishna conveying here? If one accepts a ji:va (soul) that is distinct from the de:ha (physical body), then the body he gets is referred to by the names said earlier. However, the present discussion (the 3 verses) is not about that case. We hear this verse quite often in many places. It is usually used to console people at times of death, advising them not to overly grieve, assuring them that the departed will be born again. \nPeople around feel sorrowful, hearing this (if the deceased was wicked). Whereas, Sri Krishna advises not to grieve. Thus, this slo:ka is not about a:sthikas (theists). We need to keep reminding ourselves about this. This slo:ka is for atheists, who accept only visible natural matter. As these substances are all changing, the old form goes and a new form comes, the old purpose goes and a new purpose comes, the old name goes and a new name is given. We say that the old name has gone and a new name has come. This is the argument postulated by tha:rkikas (logicians). They refer to these processes as ‘birth’ and ‘death’. \nPeople refer to it as tharka sa:sthra (philosophy of logic and reasoning). It is of two types, nya:ya (logic) and vaise:shika (atomism). Both together are referred to as tharka sa:sthra. They do not agree with the concept of transformation. On the other hand, we say ‘whatever existed as seed has transformed into a plant’. That which existed as a plant has transformed into a tree. A small newborn grew up to become a boy. That boy grew into an adult and that adult into an old person. We say parina:ma (transformation). It is called parina:ma va:da (the postulate of the theory of transformation). \nHowever, the followers of tharka sa:sthra do not concur with this line of thought. Instead, they state - ‘old form is dead and new form is born’. That is their siddha:ntham (philosophy). Since they say ‘old is gone and new has come’ – they are essentially saying that something which did not exist earlier (asath), came about now. So they are called ‘asath ka:ryava:da:s’ (those stating that which didn’t exist earlier is now born, and that which exists now will not exist later). \nHowever, Ve:dic dharma (Vedic religion) states and followers of Ve:das believe that nothing that didn’t exist [earlier] will take birth [now or later]. Similarly, nothing that exists [now] will cease to exist [later]. It is just transformation that happens. You may claim, “not really.” For example, the other day a house was burnt. All the sarees, dhotis, shirts, books, and other things were burnt to ashes. Correct. However, they are all not gone. They were burnt and became ashes - transformed. The matter still exists. All the moisture had evaporated. The earth component remained as carbon or ash. Subsequently, the ash became soil. That same soil in a different situation, at a later point in time and place, breeds a plant. \nThat [cotton] plant gave a seed, which flowered into raw cotton. That cotton was made into thread; which when woven, gave us cloth. So, the clothes have come back from the very ash, which was the result of burning down the clothes. Likewise, the burnt paper mixed up with mud in the land became fertile soil, which then led to germinating bamboo shoots. We get pulp from those bamboo shoots. That pulp is dried into ‘felt’ to give us paper again. We got back the paper. Transformation. \nWe must carefully remember both aspects. Did something emerge from nowhere, or did something pre-existing transform? In the world, only that which exists will change. Something will never emerge out of nowhere. Hence, no one would accept it as asath ka:rya (non-existent effect). It is sath ka:rya (existent effect) that goes through parina:ma. This is called ‘sath ka:rya va:da’ or ‘parina:ma va:da’. This verse is aimed at those who put aside a:thma (soul) and consider only the physical body. \nWe are not sure then, why people keep playing this slo:ka at such times [of death]. Probably because the person has suffered mruthyuvu (death), and the word mruthyuvu is used in this verse, they might be assuming that this is an appropriate verse to recite at that event. Anyway, since we must learn it…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nja:thasya hi dhruvo: mruthyuhu, dhruvam janma mruthasya cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Anyone born will eventually die. Anyone dead will take birth again.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThese transformations of forms occur continually. Whereas the raw material is never destroyed. The base material though, is eternal. It is always nithya (eternal). If we say nithya, shouldn’t it be in the same state at all times, without any change? The raw material exists at all times. Once, it was molten gold, later it changes into solid gold, then into gold biscuits. When biscuits get liquified, they are shaped into wearable ornaments. They could break and again into biscuits when melted. Subsequently, when they merge with mud, they take their original form. \nIt is always transformation only. There is never destruction. Going out of sight is only for the form, but not for the raw material. So, is it changing constantly? Yes. Is it always existing? Yes. Is it always existing, or continuously changing? It is transforming while always existing. The element is always existing, but continuously changing its forms, names, and functions. Therefore, Vedic philosophy has termed this as prava:hatho: nithya (eternal flow). Though the water in a river is continuously flowing, water as an element always exists. Similarly, the elements are eternal in their basic root form, though their forms, names, and purposes keep changing. \nIf we understand this correctly, apariha:rye: artthe: (it is not possible for anyone to stop this), God addressed Arjuna with the adjective maha: ba:ho: (mighty one with strong arms) in the previous verse. “You may be a mighty one with strong arms, but even you will not be able to stop this.” “Hence, why grieve over it?” “Stand up and fight. Fulfill your responsibility.\" In this way, Sri Krishna motivates Arjuna and orients him towards fulfilling his duty. Similarly, let us also orient ourselves to fulfill our duties. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Humans are intellectual beings. Intellect gives rise to various thoughts. When thoughts are organized in a specific manner, it is termed ‘religion’. Since there are so many people and their conduct is based on their intellect, such ways of behaving came to be called different religions. These religions are of many kinds. There should not be a question about which religion is good or which one is bad. Be it theistic or atheistic, one need not label it wrong or bad. It is not appropriate to honor a certain religion and revile another one. Why? Because it is a person’s way of streamlining his thoughts, acting accordingly… to reform and improve his life. It (religion) is a procedure by which one does not feel inconvenient… while also allowing him to live in harmony with society. If we recognize this, [there will be harmony]. A person who wants to choose a life of theism adopts a specific religion. Another person adopts a different religion. As long as the goal is to lead life properly… we don’t need to worry whether a person adopts theism or atheism. However, if the goal itself is different… when those differences grow into disparities, resulting in hatred and escalating to war… then we need to examine those religions with a critical view. Nowadays, there is a need to reflect deeply on certain religions because they are highly intolerant towards even the existence of other religions. Hence there is a need to critically view those religions. As long as everyone can live respecting the paths and beliefs of other faiths while practicing their own… while thinking that they are not a hindrance to one another, then… we need not worry about any religion or person being ‘bad’. It is said - in today’s world, huge massacres have taken place due to hatred between religions. When peoples’ thoughts wander into an unrestrained flow… it results in developing feelings of hatred, harming society. The thought process is like a water current. If we let that water flow unrestrained… it has the capacity to flood entire villages, and submerge them in the ocean. It is not that the water flow that is bad. If we don’t channelize that flow properly and simply let it flow without control, it wreaks havoc. If we channelize that same flow by constructing a dam, or making proper canals, it irrigates instead of causing damage; it bestows wealth, helping human beings and all forms of life… nourishes the flora and fauna, birds, and the soil, increases water sources and promotes fertility (of the soil). Eventually, it also has to merge into the ocean. Every drop of rainwater finally finds its way to the ocean. However, do we want to let it flow uncontrolled, causing damage… or let it multiply our wealth before reaching its final destination? This is something to introspect. What would a sensible man do? He would build structures to regulate the flow, make canals, construct containment walls and let the water flow in between. Then the water flows to different areas benefiting where needed, before it joins the ocean. Our thoughts are also similar to that water flow. No thoughts are necessarily bad inherently. There is no need to look down upon them. Only when they threaten the existence of others, do we have a responsibility to stop them. For instance, Arjuna and Duryo:dhana’s ways are different. If they could have ruled their respective share of kingdoms peacefully, they would have lived happily by themselves without bothering anyone. However, Duryo:dhana became jealous seeing Pandavas’ wealth… and cheated them through gambling, driving them to exile… not letting them live in peace even in exile attempting to kill them. After fulfilling their term of exile, when Pandavas approached Kauravas for a truce… Duryo:dhana denied their share of the kingdom and prepared for war. Pa:ndavas now have the responsibility to wage that war and put such Kauravas in their place. Take the example of our own country. There were attempts made by the Chinese to intrude unlawfully into our northern border. Fighting with them to push them back within their borders… Do we say this is wrong, violence or attacking? No. If someone says it is wrong to do so, do we call such a person a sensible human? Previous governments may have overlooked those lapses until now. Whereas, the current government is strong enough… to tighten the borders and protect the country by not ceding even an inch of land. It is an appropriate thing to do and must be done. Arjuna has a similar responsibility. When he was hesitating to fight, thinking it might be a sin to kill, worrying if the war hurts others, or if it is an oppressing or violent act… Sri Krishna took the responsibility of instructing him about his duty. If you are a theist, believe in the existence of... a:thma (soul), de:ham (body) and parama:thma (God) - and perform your duty. If you are an atheist believing that the physical body is the a:thma, nothing else… even in such a case, you cannot compromise in performing duties. Sri Krishna owned the responsibility of explaining that to him [Arjuna] in that situation. While doing so, He first proposed a:sthika va:da (the case for believers / theists). He explained in chapter 2 to some extent - from verse 12 to verse 25. Na:sthika va:da (the case for non-believers) is narrated in 26, 27 and 28 slo:kas. While it is fine to be an atheist, it is not acceptable if one avoids his duty. It is not right. You must do your duty. No need to cry. Temporary sorrow may arise. That is fine. Let us say, you bought an expensive and exquisite glassware with a beautiful flower design… and are deeply attached to it because someone dear to you guided you to buy it. Yet, it is glass. If not taken care of and it falls, it is bound to break. That is its nature. You cannot stop it. No one can stop it [from getting damaged when it falls]. If it does break one day, what will you do? Will you keep sobbing about it? No, because that is the nature of glass. It leaves a temporary sadness, due to your attachment towards it. Yes, that is inevitable. However, you cannot live in grief for the rest of your life. We need to realize this. Arjuna is in a similar situation now. He is immersed in sorrow. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:d apariha:rye:rdhe: nathwam so:chithum arhasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, you should not grieve over something inevitable.\n-----------------------------------------------\nChange is inevitable. Dro:na, Bhi:shma, and all the relatives and troops whom you are facing, will also go through change. You cannot stop it. Earlier, they were small kids and played. Now they have become adults. One day those bodies will lie on their deathbeds as well. Nothing or no one can stop it. You are thinking nothing will happen to them if you don’t [fight now]. That is not true. Hence, why grieve about it or feel sad about it? Fortunately, you (Arjuna) have the privilege to set them right [by waging this war]. You should do that. Consider a rare plant which we raised. It flowered beautifully. Some plants give only one flower in a year. It is an exotic flower known as Bramha Kamalam, which yields just one flower… that too, once in 13 years, and only during the early hours of 3 AM – 5 AM. It bloomed. You were joyful on seeing this flower. However, the fact is that its petals will shed in 2 hours. Do you grieve over this loss? It is the nature of that flower. It is apariha:ryamu (inevitable). Grieving is not necessary over what is inevitable. Therefore, your mandate is to perform your duty without fail. The flower will grow later again, as the source is still there and preserved. So do not think that you are killing someone. Matter stays forever in nature. You know the subject, you are an a:sthika (believer). Even if your beliefs are na:sthika (of non-believers), you should not grieve. Better yet if you are an a:sthika. An a:sthika (theist) believes in three entities. What are they? First - prakruthi (nature). This keeps changing continuously into various forms. It is formed as a combination of many elements. One of which is Earth. Its attribute is smell. [Another is] Water. Its property is taste. The attribute of fire is color. The characteristic of air is touch. The attribute of the sky is sound. The ensemble of a few elements with their associated attributes is known as Prakruthi. The entire ‘hardware’, what we physically see around us in the world, is collectively termed Prakruthi. The transformations happening in Prakruthi are called Vikruthi. The source is Prakruthi, which is eternal. Changes keep happening all the time, in Prakruthi. We cannot control how it initiates, nor alter the way it changes. We just feel good when these changes are favorable to us. The second reality [in which the theist believes]… is the one that supports all the transformations within Prakruthi. That reality is called ji:va (life). He invokes life. Hence he is called ji:va. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyesho::nura:thma che:thasa: ve:dithavyaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe is known to a good heart.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is one thaththva (reality). He is unchangeable no matter what we do. His swaru:pam (form) is nithyaha (always exists) ajaha (one without a specific date of birth) sa:swathaha (eternal) sttha:nuhu (unchangeable) achalaha (unmovable) sana:thanaha (permanent). This is the second reality. It exists in each and every object. 1. Prakruthi (nature) 2. A:thma thaththva (the invisible reality which gives it life like software). Hardware and software are both different. We don’t say they are one. Hardware is visible whereas software is not. 3. The [third] reality which operates this software is called sarwe:swara (the supreme being), or na:ra:yana (God). He is also called parama:thma (supreme soul), de:va (divine), or Vishnu. He has many names. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nde:vo: na:ma sahasrava:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who has numerous names.\n-----------------------------------------------\nsays sa:sthra (scripture). Three thaththva:s (realities). These 3 realities are always existent. The first among those three is being discussed now. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nja:thasya mruthyuhu dhruvaha; dhruvam janma mruthasya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAs no one can stop the changes happening in this (prakruthi), it is called ‘apariha:rya’ (inevitable).\n-----------------------------------------------\nHence, one need not grieve about it. You also have a mandate to follow your duty. Your duty is to eradicate the elements which are disturbing society. If you need to fight a war to eliminate this disturbance, you must proceed with it. Talks should have resolved the matter. You tried hard to resolve it with talks. I myself liaised on your behalf, [says Sri Krishna]. Sanjaya also attempted to mediate for peace. Since the route of dialogue failed, we are all pulled into this war. So this cannot be stopped now. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\napariha:rye ardhe: nathwam so:chithum arhasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, you should not grieve over something inevitable.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArise! Perform your duty. Fight the war and destroy the plague. This is the second of the three slokas that Sri Krishna told Arjuna… while saying that even if you are an atheist, it is not befitting to grieve. There is one more sloka in this series. We will learn about it in the upcoming sessions. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), There is a saying that’s heard very often these days… “Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow cannot be seen. Therefore, live in the present.” This sounds very logical to us. Because yesterday is gone, there is nothing you can do to bring it back. No matter how hard you try, you cannot turn the clock back. It’s gone, so there’s no use thinking about yesterday. We don’t know what will happen tomorrow, can’t foresee it. We hope to see the next day, but we never know. We are lucky if we see it, also lucky if we don’t see it! “Therefore, don’t tax your mind thinking about tomorrow. Don’t think about yesterday and spoil your mood. Live in the present.” \nThere are so many people who have even established philosophies based on it in various ways. People say this is a very wonderful saying. They also teach it as a great process in psychology. ‘True’! But, how would you conduct today without knowing about yesterday? You don’t know what happened yesterday. What will you be able to do today? Let’s say someone took charge of a position today. If he doesn’t know about the work done by the ex-official and what happened till date, what will he do today to take it forward? Thus, is it wise to say not to think about yesterday? Is the person thinking properly when saying “don’t think about the past and bother your mind?” \nOkay… They say, “You cannot foresee tomorrow, hence do not think about it.” If you do not plan what must happen tomorrow, what work can you do today? If you do not make tomorrow a goal, what work can you do today? Swachh Bharat (Clean India), the Honorable Prime Minister has set a goal for a clean Bharat (India). He started working for it. He began with the program of constructing toilets and continued with programs to clean ‘dirt’ at various levels in the entire nation. He is showing progress. He secured a good place in the hearts of all countries of the world. He stood as an exclusive friend to those nations needing assistance at the time of the pandemic too. Only because he was thinking of the future. \nDoes one have brains if he says, “you cannot see tomorrow, so do not think about it?” Gandhiji’s (Mahatma Gandhi's) 153rd birthday is coming up! The upcoming independence day celebration is the 75th. Coming up next is another celebration… if you do not set a goal today for the future, what will you do? When 2020 was approaching, our people planned several lofty goals in advance. They made progress on many aspects, keeping 2020 as the goal. Because they were able to achieve those, they were able to withstand the coronavirus even though it hit like a bomb! If global representatives and leaders do not meet to set goals for the year 2030, will they be able to make efforts to attain world peace? Will one be able to make efforts to rise up from his current position? Will a leader be able to take his people forward towards a goal? \nIt’s a ‘good thing’ to say. “Yesterday is in the past. So, don’t think about it… Tomorrow cannot be seen. So, don’t think about it… Live in the present.” What does it mean to live in the present? By the time you even say it, the minute has passed and you have stepped into another. That specific minute has become part of the past before you even implement what was said then. You have already come to the future (in relation to that minute). There are so many people who are preaching this in the name of medical science or psychology. It is said, “jo gaya so gaya” (what is gone is gone)! This puts a person on the wrong track. This is not correct. Who says this? Atheists. “Live in the present.” No good or bad… runam kruthva: ghrutham pibe:th (Kill many. Earn lots. Enjoy pleasures.) “Today is the day, yesterday is gone and you don’t know about tomorrow. Spend today happily.” Can we speak this way? Can we accept this as a preaching of the wise? All the learned must think about this carefully. \nSri Krishna is referring to the same in verse 2.28.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\navyaktha:di:ni bhu:tha:ni vyaktha madhya:ni bha:ratha ! |\navyaktha nidhana:nye:va thathra ka: paride:vana: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nArjuna! Why cry about these? Why feel sad about these?\n-----------------------------------------------\nAbout what? avyaktha:di:ni bhu:tha:ni (the unmanifested and manifested beings) - bhuthas (objects) or whatever visible. Whatever is bhavathi (is present), it is bhu:tham (substance). Whatever is existing and going through some transformation is referred to as bhu:tham. Tree is a bhu:tham, so are you and I. Bhu:tham is that substance which exists. It does not mean ghosts as the movies show. All these substances are bhuthas. Do we know their beginning, when they came into existence? avyaktha:di:ni (the unmanifested and manifested) - a:di:ni avyaktham (the beginning of the unmanifested). \nWe are seeing a human being now. When did the human race begin to exist? Several theories have come by. Someone said human beings descended from an ape that [over generations] lost its tail. We believed it to be true. Someone else said we have evolved from a single cell. We believe that to be true. Someone else says something else. We believe that to be true. Because we don’t know and we can’t see anything about it. Whoever speaks a bit logically, we think what they are saying is true. We developed ourselves to follow such [‘logical’ paths]... That which is logical, based on authoritative source of knowledge, and in the path of the wise is declared by Shastra (scripture). \nWhat does it say? It is ana:di (without beginning). prakruthim purusham chaiva vitthi: ana:di: ubha:vapi (Know that nature and the soul are both without beginning). This prakruthi (nature), ji:va (soul)… Their union, their tendency are all ana:di (eternally existing). An:di does not mean no beginning. It means that it is so long ago that one does not have what it takes to explain the when-abouts. There is a difference between ‘cannot be explained’ and ‘does not exist’, right? There is a huge difference. You are not able to explain it. There is no other way to explain it. \nIn the 4th chapter… Sri Krishna said to Arjuna, “I don’t know how many births you or I have taken, they are many!” Arjuna enquired “Why do You say, ‘many’? Tell me exactly how many.” Krishna responded, “bahu:ni (many).” Arjuna said, “I don’t agree. You must say how many. You are a sarvajna (all-knowing), right?” Krishna said, “Yes.” Arjuna challenged, “It means one who knows everything. Then why do You say that You don’t know… How can You become sarvajna otherwise?” Krishna smiled and said, “I can, [say how many] but you should be able to understand it… if I say a number that you cannot comprehend, why should I trouble you with that?... that is why I am simply stating it as ‘many’.” \nWe must know the term [when counted], right? There is an example for this in Srimad Ramayana. The warrior vanaras (monkeys) were all entering Lanka. The bridge was constructed. They started entering Lanka. Many had entered by then. Ravana (the demon king) got this message. He went upstairs to see them. He took Suka and Sharana along who had gone to see them earlier. He asked them to explain who they were and all about them. They started explaining. They said, “Before we start detailing how many of them, we need to tell you about numbers. Can we?” Ravana said, “Don’t I know numbers?” Yes, you know, but listen anyway. \nTwo zeros after 1 is hundred. Three zeros after 1 is a thousand. Six zeros after 1 is 10 lakh (1 million). Seven zeros makes it a crore (10 million). Another three zeros make it a thousand crores (10 billion). Another three zeros make it a lakh crores (100 billion). They went as far as 65 zeros after 1! Ravana knew numbers, but not to this level. He was shocked to hear! Can you name the number when 65 zeros are written after the number 1? We don’t know. We know a million, where there are 6 zeros. A billion, 9 zeros. A trillion 12 zeros. Another 12 is trillion trillions. After that? We don’t know. \nSo, 65 zeros after 1 is of the order o:gham, maho:gham (incomprehensible). Let us stop here, why bother you with further numbers? He stopped at 65 zeros. Veda (the scriptures) spoke about what 400 zeros after 1. Our mathematicians are yet to know what those are. If we say 1000 zeros, what can he say? He will just be shocked with a mouth wide open! Why trouble you? That is why I am stating, “many”. We must remember that “many” in this context is something that is incomprehensible for us. \nWhen did all the living beings start taking births? avyaktha a:di:ni (the unmanifested and manifested) - do not know the beginning. avyaktha nidhana:ni (the unmanifested end) - How long will this continue? We don’t know! We do not know how long this [taking births] will continue. Because it's not just this Earth, there is a similar planet 300 million light years away. We don’t know how many and what kind of species of life exist there. There may be human species like us. We don’t know if he also behaves just like us. We don’t know how many such [realms] exist. Therefore, we don’t know how and where these exist. \navyaktha nidhana:ni (the unmanifested end) - What we know is vyaktha madhya:ni (the state in between). You don’t know the previous state or that of the future. You only know the state in between. You did not come here because you thought of it. Also, you cannot be here because you want to. You will have to change from the current form and take another. Then, what can you do about it now? They, Drona and Bhishma, are also in the same boat. Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra, your elder and younger brothers are all in the same boat. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthathra ka: paride:vana:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhy grieve over that which is not in your hands?\n-----------------------------------------------\nOh no! Morning has changed to afternoon. Oh no! The afternoon has now become evening! I must stop this…! If anyone makes such an effort, what would we think about him? We would sympathize. He may be needing medical attention. We can’t do anything else. \nthathra ka: paride:vana: (Why grieve over that which is not in your hands?) We must remember who the targeted audience [for Sri Krishna] is here. It is those who say they don’t believe in atma (soul), think of and believe in only that which is visible. Even for them… because they do not understand the beginning and the end and only believe in the state in between… even that state doesn’t stop, it changes every moment. One need not cry for this. This is the summary of what Sri Krishna says. He explained this in 3 verses so far. Let’s clarify further as we move forward. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In Sri:man Maha:bha:ratha, after the Maha:bha:ratha War, Dhruthara:shtra starts grieving and shedding tears. Likely crocodile tears, insincere at best! Vidura then said to him, “Don’t cry unnecessarily. Is it needed for you at this time?” He says to Dhruthara:shtra something similar to what Sri Krishna says in Gita verse 2.28. What’s it?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nabha:va:di:ni bhu:tha:ni: bha:va madhya:ni bha:ratha \nabhava nidana:nyaiva thathraka: paride:vana:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhy do you cry? What can you accomplish by crying?\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhy do you cry? Your sons, step sons or kings, soldiers, and others are all pancha bhu:thas (five elements of Nature). They are all just formations of the pancha bhu:thas. Souls, their path, karma (actions), past records of the souls, punya (good deeds) and pa:pa (bad deeds), results of good and bad actions, right and wrong… if you are someone who thinks of these, you would not have encouraged the war. You do not have such wisdom. Also, you do not have such thoughts and belief. Your goal is to just keep your children, your sons, happy. Because you want only them to lead a happy life, you, with the intention of harassing them, have left Pa:ndavas (the righteous brothers), who do good deeds. You let your beast-like sons loose on Pa:ndavas, making them scapegoats. The result was that other than Pa:ndavas, you don’t have anyone alive, including your children. You are left alone.\nFor all these… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nabha:va:di:ni bhu:tha:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nDon’t know the beginning of these bhu:thas (elements)…\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey [bhu:thas] are here now. You thought they were your sons because they were born to you. You only wanted them to be happy and you did not think about what they did for that. Some people get into the habit of drinking for pleasure. Some people get used to taking various drugs for pleasure. They have only one goal, ‘Live this moment.’ Have ‘pleasure’ now. Don’t think about anything before or after. In pleasure now… be in heaven! That’s all he wants. You also were thinking the same way, thinking only of your sons’ happiness. You didn’t care even if they were trying to burn Pa:ndavas in the wax house. You didn’t warn and stop them even when they were poisoning Pa:ndavas. You couldn’t even open your mouth once to stop them from disrobing a woman in the middle of the assembly. What kind of a person are you? You put everything at stake for temporary happiness. Why are you crying now?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nadarsa:na:th a:pathathi:tha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nnot knowing where they are coming from, all these have formed\n-----------------------------------------------\nBecause they can’t be seen. If they are visible, we can recognize them. We did not see them before or after [death]. Someone asked, “What does it mean that they are not visible? What happens to them?” What happens [to them]? We brought matti (clay). We made pots out of it. The pots were beautiful. They broke into pieces, but they were good to play with. They broke into further pieces and then to powder. Then it became part of clay again. That which has become part of clay will somewhere, somehow become something else. It becomes part of clay again and will transform into a pot. However, we are not sure if it will come back here in the same town or not. We could dig the clay from here, take it to the neighboring town and get pots made there. Or take it to a neighboring state to get pots made there. Or it could have been necessary to be taken elsewhere as raw material where there is none and made into a pot there. We cannot see where it’s being reproduced. However, it will surely transform into another form. We cannot have its darshan (sight). Its beginning is also not visible to us.\nTherefore…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npunascha:darsanam gatha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou have given birth to 100 kids. Did anyone tell you where they came from?\n-----------------------------------------------\nDid you ask them to come from anywhere specific as your children? They were born to you, based on their karma (actions), past records. If they were born to a commoner, they would have been in a better state. He would have punished them and instructed them to be on the right path. “We shouldn’t step into their space.” “It is a question of their individuality.” “It’s their independence and we must not interfere.” “This is about their privacy, individuality.” This is what [some] ‘rich’ parents say. They spend lakhs and crores of rupees to put them into schools, not caring about where they go with their friends. At last, they become useless ‘products’ entering society. Then, they [parents] realize and turn to Swamis (spiritual teachers), temples, etc., seeking support in reforming their kids. It’s too late, what’s the use? Or they will cry, why cry now?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nadarshana:th a:pathitha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthey will go back to that invisible state\n-----------------------------------------------\nA pra:ni (living being) comes from an unrecognized state and goes back to an unrecognized state. It’s only a short time in-between. It is the quality of a wise one to utilize the short time in the right way. To decide what is the right way, the short time may not be enough. That is why, one must follow the path of knowledgeable people. Therefore, you must try to walk the path given by sa:sthra (scriptures). It is essential for you to take guidance from those people who can show that path. “Why? I don’t need to be told by anyone.” “I know what I am. I can decide my own future.” “I live independently.” It’s okay, but when will he know its consequences? How many such people are found worthy of being recorded in history? Every minute… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nuthpadyanthe: vili:yanthe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nbirth and death goes on\n-----------------------------------------------\nLike insects born in the evening rain or the morning showers. In crores (millions) of numbers, he [ji:va (soul)] takes birth and dies, on and on! However, who remains [eternally]? The crores of raindrops all do not end up becoming pearls. It seems that the star Swathi makes one good raindrop lucky to become a pearl. That is also a raindrop. However, its value is higher and great. How many heads or necks will it adorn?! How it works to inspire the beauty of so many people! The beauty it has enhanced! That is also a raindrop. Do you desire to become that raindrop? Or one of the many crore raindrops that get washed away? Do you desire to be a cuckoo born somewhere on a tree, or a loud, wandering crow? Think. A silkworm is very beautiful. There are other crores of insects born in the rainwater. However, it [silkworm] is what gets value and recognition. Not the others.\nDear…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npunascha: adarsanam gatha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNeither they mean something to you nor you mean anything to them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWho becomes what to who here? Some bhu:thas (elements) came together and one form is made. Some bhu:thas came together and another form is made. They stay together for some time and later disperse on their paths. The same happened to you also now. Why do you cry about it? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthathraka: paride:vana:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne need not cry about these [bodies].\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou must utilize them properly. To do so, you must be bound to an authoritative source of knowledge. You must lead life bound by the words of the Wise. There is a section Chithrake:thu Upa:khya:nam in Bha:gavatham. After a long while, due to the grace of a great being’s teaching, a kid was born. It was said that he would live only for 4 years. However, he lived as an obedient and well-mannered child. He died and all of them wept uncontrollably. The same great being came back. [Parents of the boy] We want that child back. [The Great Being] Why do you want him? [Parents] He loves us. [Great being] Do you know that for certain? [Parents] Yes, we are sure. [Great being] I will call him. Ask him. If he really loves you that much, we will try to bring him back alive. Using his yogic power, he invoked that ji:va (soul) there. \n[Great being talking to the boy’s soul] It seems these are your parents. They are asking you to come back. It seems you love them a lot. That ji:va responded. [Boy’s soul] Parents? In which number body? To which body? Because once this body is gone, another body comes followed by another. Hundreds of bodies passed by in the meantime for me. For everybody, there is a set of parents. How many parents can I satisfy? I am so sorry, he said! That’s when their eyes opened to the truth. Chithrake:thu Upa:khya:nam is a famous historic episode in Sri:mad Bha:gavatham. This is something in life that continues to occur with no beginning and no end. It doesn’t matter if you accept the existence of a soul or not. You may agree to the existence of a path of a soul or not. No matter if you are a theist or an atheist. There is no need to cry about the hardships you face while performing your duties. For this, one needs wisdom. Behave as a wise man. Do your duty properly. \nThere could be difficult times when performing your duties. A national guard at the border could get hurt when fired upon. As he crawls, his legs may get scarred. Or a thorn could get into his feet. As you are performing your duties, face any difficulties that arise. Once you return victorious, you may be awarded a medal in the presence of hundred or thousand people, and welcomed back with a huge party. Yes, it is also something that comes as a favorable part of your duty. Hence, it is not necessary to get overly excited. Or it isn’t necessary to get depressed otherwise. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthathraka: paride:vana:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt’s not the quality of a wise one to cry in such situations.\n-----------------------------------------------\nMotivating Arjuna towards duty, Sri Krishna states that neither an atheist nor a theist needs to cry. Sri Krishna teaches about the thatthvas (ultimate realities), de:ha (body) and a:thma (soul) and moves further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "episode": 65,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), There are certain methods to conclude the summary of a scripture. Also, there are certain ways to decide if a certain aspect must be told in a specific way in a specific context. Bhagavad Gita is a:dhya:thmika grantha (spiritual scripture) that is taught to an a:sthika (believer), one who believes in Vedas. One who believes in Vedas believes in prakruthi (nature), ji:va (soul), and parama:thma (supreme soul, God). These three are called thaththvas (ultimate realities). Together, they are called thaththva thryam (three ultimate realities). It is said that a:sthika is one who believes in the three ultimate realities and walks the path defined by Vedas.\nEach of the three are different thaththvas, and hence their characteristics are different. Prakruthi is a separate dravya (substance). Ji:va is a different thaththva. Parama:thma is a different thaththva. Generally, when we speak of a:thma (soul), people ask to demonstrate a:thma with an example in order to believe it. It sounds good. However, if we must use an example, from where do we reference it? We must show examples relating to the thaththva that you want to believe. However, we do not have the ability to see that which is related to the thaththva. Our senses do not have the capability.\nFor example, our ear cannot recognize all types of sounds, even in the general context. There are certain types of mosquito repellents. When turned on, a sound is produced that only mosquitos can hear. They say that mosquitos get tired of it and leave. People say sound is measured in unit decibels. It is said that if the sound is less than 5 dB, we cannot hear it. Also, it seems we cannot hear any sound that is above 20 dB. Anything above or below those limits is not audible. That’s the range of our sense organs. Every sense organ has such certain limitations. Thus, we cannot recognize certain things. Our sense organ does not have the ability to hear something.\nWhen our sense organs can’t even recognize all the characteristics of visible material, how can we ask for a demonstration from a:thma thaththva to believe it!? The demonstration has to use matter from prakruthi. Whatever can be shown must be from prakruthi. However, prakruthi is a different thaththva. Ji:va thaththva is a different one. How can it work if we take an example from one thaththva to prove another thaththva? People ask to show something from somewhere about parama:thma so as to believe it. We can only show something to you that is part of prakruthi. It’s not possible to show anything ‘from’ a:thma (thaththva) or in any other way. Parama:thma is a different thaththva altogether. If we must demonstrate that different thaththva (Parama:thma), how can we use anything from prakruthi to do so? \nSo, it’s not possible in any way to show that it (soul) is like something else. Then, how do we know about it? That is why Veda has become essential for us. That is why the assumption that goes along the path proven by Veda has also become essential. It is known as anuma:na (inference). Hence, it was necessary for our people to accept both anuma:na and shabda (Vedas). Veda states that they (3 ultimate realities) exist. We must learn through them. This is one method. They recognize the thaththva thrayam (three ultimate realities). They accept the three ultimate realities. They try to conform everything else in the same direction [of the three ultimate realities]. \nIn them [Vedas] or in any other scripture that’s available elsewise. There is a method to establish - ‘this is what was told in that [scripture]’. Why are we discussing this now? Because, in Bhagavad Gita… Sri Krishna, who began to guide Arjuna, also gave required information necessary for atheists and their ability. Why would He do that? It is possible that one may raise such a question. What did we learn earlier in the three verses 2.26, 2.27, and 2.28? That even for one who is an atheist it’s not necessary to cry when faced with challenges while performing duties. Sri Krishna stated this in those verses.\nOne may question, “Why would Sri Krishna refer to him (atheist) here?” If you question like that ‘dhruvam janma mruthasya cha’ (certainly, the one who dies will be born again) would mean, the same one who died will come back alive. In that case, he would be named something different [ghost etc]. If he moves around us, it’s dangerous to us. That is why, the compilers of these great scriptures have established certain methods in order to make a conclusion on a certain aspect [in a scripture]. They are termed tha:thparya nirna:yakamulu (factors leading to conclusive decisions). They are of six types, and hence known as shad vidha tha:thparya nirna:yaka lingamulu (6 kinds of factors that lead to and support the conclusions). Lingas mean the identifiers. Based on these, we reach tha:thparyam (the conclusions). \nWhat are they? Upakrama upasamha:rou (the beginning and the end of a scripture must be in line with each other). Both must ‘meet’. [The first of the 6 is] upakramo:pa upasamha:rou. The second is abhya:sa (repetition): Whatever he wants to say, he must begin and conclude with it. And the same must be touched at certain intervals throughout the work. This is called abhya:sam (repetition or reminding). This is termed abhya:sa: Not just that, there must be something new, apur:rvatha (novelty), in what is being explained. Additionally, what do we attain as a result of all this? Let’s say we work hard and finally learn all these. What is the result of knowing it? There must be some phalam (result). There should be clarity about the end result.\nNext is artthava:da: upapatthi: cha (the need for acclaim and reasoning). Artthava:da, he needs to acclaim that which he states as the end result. Because he must create ruchi (interest), and praro:chana (motivation). What can he do to motivate? He must say something of the sort, “So and so person has tried this, that made him happy.” “Someone else has not done this. So, they did not attain the right state.” Thus, he must strengthen it by speaking about a few related incidents. Keeping aside if there is truth in it or not, our people narrate Sathyana:ra:yana Vrat stories - 5 or 6 of them. To create interest in the vrat (vow), to increase the number of people performing the vrat... to secure the life of people who organize it with assured income... they have included 5 stories. \nWhat is narrated in those 5 stories? One who performed the vrat has earned good profits in their business. One who did not do it suffered great loss. One who performed this had a peaceful journey. One who did not believe it got into some kind of loss due to an accident. These are the types of stories in it. This is known as, ‘exploiting sentiment’. It forcefully entices a person by appealing to his heart (manas). Getting them into it with fear, or another way. “Oh! Is that how he got all the benefits? I also want benefit/profit.” So he steps into it. “Oh! Is that how he got into losses? I don’t want to incur losses.” So he does not miss performing it. They have to be persuaded to perform it out of fear or some other reason, or some kind of hope. Many people perform it out of that hope. Not thinking if it’s right or not, if it exists in pura:na (ancient texts) or not, or if those stories fit in at all.\nIn fact, if God is truly God, He would never hurt His ‘children’. Rewarding one for performing it [the vrat]... or amputate his legs, hurt his business by drowning his ship, put him into losses, get him into an accident if one does not perform it. HE does not do these. You all have children, you look after them. If your children do not obey your word, would you kill them? If he does not abide by your word, would you chop his legs? If he does not repeat what you said, would you cut his tongue? Who does such kind of things? It’s not something a mother and father would do. It is something that a businessman would do. Or something that a ra:kshasa (demon), a cruel one, or a vampire would do. Why would God do such a thing? This technique is known as invoking fear. This is also one type of artthava:da. These are narrations of stories that can imprint the intended message in the heart of a person. They can be termed as artthava:da. All artthava:das may not be necessarily true. The goal is to deliver the message to the heart but one need not take them literally. \nHowever, the stories in the vrat are playing a ‘great’ role. Let’s keep that aside. Artthava:da - this is also one aspect of reaching conclusion. Upapatthi: cha (reasons for it). “Due to this reason, it happens this way. Due to this reason, it does not happen this way.” This is how it must be concluded. All these are used in reaching conclusions about something. Upakramo:pa samha:rou, abhya:sa: apu:rvatha: phalam, artthava:da: upapatthi: cha. Upakramo:pa samha:rou is one of them. This is one lingam (identifier). Upakramo:pa samha:rou, abhya:sa, apu:rvatha, phalam, artthava:da, upapatthi cha. These are the six. They decide the general dictum. If we can coordinate all these six in Bhagavad Gita, we can realize that the three verses [2.26, 2.27, and 2.28] are outside of the current context. That is why, the decision of the wise is that we remember the three verses as those being addressed to atheists and not for anyone else. \nWe must not pick up something from the midst of somewhere and conclude it in a way that appeals to us. If you speak that way, it will be analogous to reading the entire Sri:mad Bha:gavatham, yet declaring that it states, “There is no God.” Does Bha:gavatham say so? Yes, there is one instance where the scripture reads so. However… Who said it and to whom? Examining the context, it is what Prahlada’s father, Hiranyakasipa tells him. In that case, that is what it would say there. Can we take it as the summary of the scripture? No. Therefore, ja:thasya hi dhruvo: mruthyuhu (for one who is born, death is certain)… beginning with attha chainam (this body is not eternal)… avyaktha:di:ni bhu:tha:ni (the unmanifested and manifested beings)… vyaktha madhya:ni bha:ratha (the manifested beings are in between)… avyaktha nidhana:nyaiva (the unmanifested will eventually perish). \nThese three verses are delivered, keeping in mind the atheist. Bhagava:n Sri Krishna, with the responsibility of satisfying an atheist… to ensure he also understands the topic, explains it to Arjuna. There is no need to cry. Don’t cry for the soul or for the body. This is how He starts. What did He start off with? aso:chya:n anvaso:chasthvam (you grieve for those who should not be grieved for)... prajna:va:da:mscha (and you speak words of wisdom)… gatha:su:n agatha:su:n (for those who are dead and those who are not dead). He used two words in verse 2.11. gatha:su:vu (those that lose pra:na, life force), agatha:su:vu (those that do not lose pra:na, life force). Those that lose pra:na are bodies. Those that do not lose pra:na are souls. Pra:na never leaves the soul. Soul is always attached to pra:na, maha:pra:na (great life force) with it. Therefore, it (maha:pra:na) is always within (a:thma). If it leaves [the body], it leaves only with [a:thma]. Therefore, it is termed agatha:su. No matter what you do with the body, you cannot hold pra:na with it [forever]. Even if a doctor tries to ventilate a body, it may hold on until the ventilation is in progress. Whenever it’s removed, it [pra:na] leaves [the body]. Hence, it is termed gatha:su (the body).\nSo far, He tried to clearly specify and clarify the quality of the body and the soul. Now, He takes the responsibility of clarifying the unique attribute of the soul. It [soul] is something that we cannot define as such. It is therefore a:scharyakara (very amazing). He moves ahead to explain about it. Let’s also gradually try to understand this. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a wonderful teaching. Sri Krishna Himself delivered this exceptional teaching to uplift all people. Some people are a:sthikas (theists), believers of Veda. Some are na:sthikas (atheists), who do not believe in Veda. Some accept the existing truths in different ways. God’s goal is to give that which is essential for the upliftment of all types of people. Why should He give it? A human being must be molded to perform his duty, not be driven away from it. He should never step away from his duty. Particularly, grown-ups should not behave in this way. When one has to do work, he must be educated about the work he should be doing but not be given various facilities which make him stop working, turning him into a lazy, inactive, and unproductive person. Unfortunately, rulers these days are giving various ‘free facilities’ and thus, there is no motivation for people to work for a living. Hence, a large number of individuals are developing an inability to work, thus affecting society. We all know this. God’s goal is to convey that this is not right. That’s the summary of Sri Krishna’s teaching.\nIn the process of teaching Arjuna about performing duties as part of chapter 2, Sri Krishna explains how believers in sari:ra (body), indwelling a:thma (soul), and the underlying parama:thma (God) must perform their duty. Also, those who believe only in what’s visible must perform their duty. Generally, a person is happy if everything is going as per plan. If it’s not, he feels miserable. When one is in a miserable state, there’s a risk of quitting one’s duty. What is important is to recognize duty and act accordingly. ‘Act accordingly’ - not step away from duty or grieve. That is why, in chapter 2, Sri Krishna is teaching Arjuna his duty. Arjuna clearly prayed…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyachchhre:yas sya:n nischitham bru:hi thanme:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Whatever is decided by You, Lord, earlier as the right thing to do and appropriate for me, grace me with that.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nBecause he (Arjuna) also clearly asked for it, He (Sri Krishna) began to explain what his duty was. Firstly, He said it’s unnecessary to cry for relatives. You are fighting a dha:rmic (righteous) war to uphold dharma, not transgress it. In a dha:rmic war, some might get hurt or lose life. However, when the purpose is to attain a worthy goal, then there is no need to worry about petty troubles. Therefore, it is not necessary to grieve.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna:nu so:chithu marhasi…\nthathra ka: paride:vana:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“You should not grieve for what is not worthy of grief.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe said this earlier. Even those who do not believe in a:thma (soul) or parama:thma (God) need not grieve at difficult times while performing duties. He explained this in 3 verses [2.27, 2.28, 2.29].\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\navyaktha:di:ni bhu:tha:ni vyakthamadhya:ni bha:ratha ! |\navyaktha nidhana:ni [e:va] thathra ka: paride:vana: || [2.28]\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Those that are unmanifested are eternal, while those that are manifested are temporary. Therefore, why should you grieve?”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe do not know what is the beginning of all that we see and how and when it all ends. However, as you’re living in the present, you must recognize your duty and make all efforts to properly carry it out. He explained this in the last of the three verses where He addressed those who do not believe in a:thma thathva (soul’s reality). Many people these days say this, right? We don’t know the past, so don’t think about it. We don’t see the future, so don’t think about it. Live for the present. Pay attention only to this. We have already discussed a little about this in previous sessions. Thus, He had so far conveyed what He wanted to teach Arjuna.\nIn fact, Arjuna is not an atheist. His decisions are based on dharma. He has the knowledge of Vedas. He also has knowledge of scriptures. He is used to carrying out various righteous activities. He belongs to such a lineage. He is neither ignorant nor believes only in what is visible. Even if you believe only in what’s visible, you need not cry. As a vaidic (believer in Vedas), you need not cry at all. He instructed that even if there is temporary grief, it is the characteristic of the wise to make their heart realize what’s right, act with courage, and direct towards duty.\nNow, He sets aside the guidance given to the atheists [2.26, 2.27, 2.28] and moves forward to continue the guidance he has begun to give for relieving grief. How can one overcome grief? tharathi so:kam a:thmavith (the one who knows the soul overcomes sorrow) is a rule in Vedas. Sadness is that feeling of anguish when you lose something you like. In fact, there is nothing known as ‘losing’ what you like. First, we must get clarity on what it is that is liking something. When we say ‘we’, there are two objects here. One is the form of Nature that is external and visible, called the body. The second is that which dwells within, enables it (body) to work, keeps thinking of it as ‘I’, ‘mine’, ‘for me’, ‘because of me’ and thus experiences happiness or sadness. It is called ji:va (individual soul). He dwells within and is not visible. The body is visible. He (Sri Krishna) must show the visible body, explain it, and elaborate on it. He must also clarify the invisible a:thma thathva (soul’s reality). A:thma thathva and sari:ra thathva (realities of the soul and body) are both different from each other. They are contrary to each other. The body is a combination of some things/parts. The soul is a dravya (substance) without any parts. Because the body is made of certain parts, subsequently, it loses them, and ultimately disintegrates. The parts get separated. However, the soul does not have any constituent parts. Thus, disintegration does not apply to the soul. Therefore, the soul is ajaha (without birth), nithyaha (eternally existing), sa:svathaha (eternally stable), pura:naha (always new). Thus, He explained it (a:thma thathva).\nNothing can ever cut through it, make it wet, burn it, or dry it. However, the body is a combination of many substances and thus it disintegrates into its constituent parts. When disintegration begins and when one thinks of it as theirs, one begins to feel sad about losing it. We cannot stop changes in the body. We cannot bring changes in the soul. This must be clarified to Arjuna. If one is a believer in only the body (not soul), can he stop changes in the body? No, he cannot. A boy becomes an adult, an adult becomes old. That implies the body is going through changes. There is no way for anyone to stop these changes. After a while, it (the body) stops working. In that case too, he cannot do anything. Even if you keep the existence of the soul aside and look at only what's visible, there are changes there as well. You see shoots in a plant. After a few days, they grow a little bigger. Then, into even larger leaves. After that, they dry up and gradually fall. Afterwards, they become powder-like and finally return back to the soil. They come from the soil and go into the soil. In the meantime, they change, transforming through various stages. Can we stop any of these changes? No, we have no control over any of the changes. When they are out of your control and happen by themselves, then why do you think of it as ‘I’, ‘Mine’, ‘For me’ and take it on yourself? Secondly, they do not stop changing even if you try. So, why cry about them? “That is why, you don’t need to cry,” said Sri Krishna to Arjuna earlier.\nBecause Arjuna believes that what’s indwelling is the soul, He thought of clearly explaining a:thma thathva (reality of the soul). He doesn’t need to cry about the body. First of all, why did Arjuna start crying? Because Bhi:shma, whom he thinks of as his relative, Dro:na, whom he thinks of as his guru, and all others whom he thinks of as related by blood and by soul, thinking that all of them will die, he began to feel sad in his heart and got upset. However, can you stop this body’s relationship with them just because you want to? Can you stop that from happening? You can’t. Whether you cry or not, changes [to the body] will not stop. Whether you fight it or not, changes [to the body] will not stop. You cannot stop the changes. Therefore, when nothing is in your control, thinking that you will do something about it is foolish and unwise. That is ignorance. He tried to clarify this to Arjuna in various ways. No need to cry about the body. How about a:thma (soul)? Because he has been in a body for some time and experienced happy times and bad times whilst in the body, if he has to leave it now, wouldn’t he feel sad? Shouldn’t he cry about that? You need not cry about the a:thma (soul) also. Because the soul goes to the next body due to the good and bad things it does whilst in the current body. If he does more good deeds, the ji:va (individual soul) will attain a body in a family to experience the result of those pious acts. I.e., he takes a body there. Or if he does some other type of deeds, he will take birth in a suitable place to experience those. Ultimately, it (body) goes through change and ends up somewhere. He therefore explained earlier on why he need not grieve over it (body). In fact, the change (in body) is a result of the indwelling a:thma (soul). Arjuna is a theist, hence he must be told about a:thma (soul). A:thma does not die no matter what one does. So, why cry about it? No need to cry. In any case, how does it look? What does it do? To explain this, He begins verse 2.29.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nA:thma, soul, always surprises even those who think they know quite a lot about it.\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSri Krishna thus begins to explain the astonishing swaru:pa (innate nature) and swabha:va (its qualities) in chapter 2.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKeeping aside the discussion of atheism, let’s move ahead to try to listen to the guidance given to a theist. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Many people in our world live by believing only in what’s visible. If we speak of the invisible, they feel somewhat surprised. They don’t put their mind to it. They don’t feel like believing in it. We think probably more than 90% of the world population lives focusing only on the visible. In fact, many live believing that which is not true. Even though they know it’s not true, they respond to it because they like it. How is that?\nMany people watch movies these days. They [movies] show one person jumping down the hill or leaping up to the hill-top. They show someone flying up in the sky with some kind of gear. They also show one riding a motorcycle, taking five huge circles, landing exactly on a specific spot and going forward. What is this technology called? Graphics. Everyone knows that anything presented using graphics is not real. However, we spend a lot on it. We enjoy the experience in various ways. Entertainment. One likes to believe it despite knowing that it is not real.\nHowever, despite it being real, despite it running this body, despite it being extremely powerful while being the subtlest, when we try to explain something about a:thma (soul), it is difficult to concentrate, it is difficult to focus on it. It is difficult to have a taste for it. We get tired of listening to it. An example to understand what that is like…\nIn Ra:ma:yana (the epic Ramayana), in the city of Lanka, everything centers on Ra:vana (the demon king). All you can hear is Ra:vana’s name, and songs in praise of him. All the work done is for him. In such a place, when Mother Si:tha (Sita) sat under the tree in Asho:ka Forest, she heard the name of Ra:ma (Rama). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nra:ja: dasaratho: na:ma rathakunjara va:jima:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHow surprising would it be to hear Ra:ma’s story in that place?\n-----------------------------------------------\nShe looked to one side, then to the other. She looked up and down, not knowing where it was coming from. She didn’t understand how it is possible to hear sanki:rthana (glory), of Ra:ma in the city of Lanka. She wondered if it was coming from within her because she had been incessantly recollecting the same. They say, she even searched within. How surprising is that [Rama’s name in Lanka]? Similarly, it is surprising if anyone in this world speaks about a:thma (soul). If a cold lotus flower blooms in an extremely blazing fire pot, how surprising will it be? That is how it feels speaking about a:thma in this world. It is difficult to inculcate interest in this topic.\nIn verse 2.29, Sri Krishna wonderfully explains how difficult it is to analyze, speak of, or recollect the topic related to a:thma.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:scharyavath pasyathi kaschid e:nam \na:scharyavath vadathi thatthaiva cha anyaha |\na:scharyavach chainam anyaha sruno:thi \nsruthva:py e:nam ve:da na chaiva kaschith ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSome see the soul as amazing, some speak of it as amazing, and others hear of it as amazing, yet no one truly knows it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf an object that is never heard of or never seen suddenly appears, how would you feel? You feel amazed. It feels wonderful and unique. Similarly, anyone who wants to see it [soul] will always be amazed. However, not everyone will attain knowledge of it. Only one. As people say, “one in a million.” Attaining knowledge of a:thma itself is very rare. There are so many types of species in the world. There are many births, many living beings. It’s actually surprising to even get a human birth amongst all the others. It’s a great wonder that a ji:vi (soul) gets a human body. \nCha:ndogya Upanishad states how he gets it. After understanding, you will feel it’s practical... [yet], to attain a human body is not at all easy. It’s a great fortune to obtain a human body amongst all types of animal bodies. Among those [with human bodies], having an inclination towards soul and God is even more rare. If one in millions of millions species gets a human birth, only one among such millions of millions people have a chance to develop interest in a:thma (soul). Such a person is quite distinct compared to the others.\nIn fact, to attain a human birth, many types of pa:pas (bad actions), bad actions and thoughts from the past must be nullified. One must accrue many punyas (virtues). Therefore, the effect of accumulated punya earned in various ways, resulting in nullifying of pa:pas accrued over countless births gives one a human birth. Additionally, attaining human birth requires immense thapas (penance). Attaining human birth is thus not simple. In all those extremely hard-working people, only one would develop jigna:sa (desire to know), the desire to know why he was born.\nIf there are millions of those desirous to know the reason behind birth, only one would make an effort in that direction. If there are millions of those making an effort, only a small percentage will develop interest and dedication to research it. In fact, even for those people, a:thma thaththva (reality of soul) will continue to be a:scharyavath (surprising) no matter how much they learn about it. It will continue to be new. Because it is not something that can get old. Something getting old implies it losing its novelty, or fading. That happens only when something is formed through the union of some subtle particles… When those separate, the substance fades or loses [its charm].\nIn the early morning, a blossoming flower looks fresh and gives a pleasant fragrance. After some time, it gradually releases the tiniest whiffs of fragrance in all directions. After it has released it all, if there is a chance to add new ones, i.e., if it remains attached to the tree, it will replenish from the soil, making up for whatever was dispelled. However, when it is separated from the tree and it has released the fragrance in all directions, the blossomed flower of the morning withers gradually by the evening hours. It will gradually lose its existence because its constituent parts have separated from it. \nHowever, a:thma does not have parts, and thus there is nothing that gets separated from it. Thus, it never gets old. It always looks new. No matter how long we look at it, we don’t feel as if we know it… or have seen it… or feel bored of seeing it. It [soul] does not have that kind of quality. However, it takes many births of thapas to get this state in him. He gets that eligibility only when he performs long and severe penance focusing in that direction.\nThere is something different known as a:thma (soul). The body now is moving. When a body doesn’t function, we call it a dead body. It was moving earlier. Hence, there is something that is making it move. If such sense develops, and one researches it, [knowing that] it should dwell within and spread throughout - thus, it is known as a:thma. If this is the case, knowing a:thma as it must be known is termed as thaththva jna:na (knowledge of reality).\nJna:na (knowledge) is of two types. One is the general knowledge. Second is tha:tthvika jna:na (true knowledge). Tha:tthvika jna:na is understanding something comprehensively as it is in every way. A:thma (soul) probably exists somewhere within. It must be something distinct. It must be something small. We can guess all these. \n**HH used scale and check | However, we do not have any ‘scale’ to ‘check’ if all that is true. Only sa:sthra (scriptures) must explain this a:thma thaththva. One must dig into sa:sthra, learn and understand it as it is meant to be understood. This generally does not happen. That is why, a:scharyavath pasyathi (some see it as amazing)…\nHe understands bits of it such as: There is something that is different from the body. That itself is a wonder. What is its size? Where is it located? How does it look? Does it spread throughout the body? Or… Is it located in a corner and controlling the rest of it? If it is controlling all parts, does it spread throughout? Does it spread or does it spread its knowledge? If a part is broken, the broken part’s memory stays with the whole. We are witnessing that in the world. What is it that is realizing all of them [body parts] that way? It is very difficult to understand it. \nWe can recognize that something like that exists with our imagination. It [part] is not moving now, but moved before. Hence, whatever had enabled it to move before is there behind it. Even if it loses a [body] part, it can recollect the memories with regards to the part. If it loses another part, it can recollect the respective memories too. It is spreading through all the parts. What that probably implies is… like a di:pam (lamp), that spreads around in the form of its light… ji:va (soul) also exists and spreads in the form of knowledge throughout the body situated in some area of the body. We can imagine this to a certain level.\nHow does he look? Where does he come from? How does he come? When does he come? Exactly, how do we know the time of birth for naming that? All these are questionable if we want to learn only by observation. However, if we learn through the scriptures given by Elders, the wise, all these details are available. They mention how to perceive it. They mention its size. They mention what it does. What we then attain is known as tha:ththvika jna:na.\n**HH used superficial knowledge | Normally, what we attain is superficial knowledge. However, understanding something as it is, is called tha:tthvika jna:na, knowledge of underlying principles. It is very difficult to attain tha:tthvika jna:na about soul. If anyone attains it, we will be surprised to see him. Even if he attained clarity to that level, he only believes it because he heard it. It is not possible to ‘see’ the soul even for him. However much you hear about it, it will still feel that much new.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:scharyavath pasyathi kaschid e:nam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhenever he sees it, speaks about it, has a darshan (vision) via knowledge of it… it will always feel new.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThings in the world will get monotonous after some time, we get bored. Does one get bored about a:thma? No. Because it is always new, it does not get attached to anything. Sri Krishna explains this to Arjuna. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:scharyavath pasyathi kaschid e:nam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHow about the one teaching about a:thma? Does he have complete knowledge of it?\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt surprises the one who is speaking about it. It is surprising for the listener and for the speaker. Any mention of a:thma thaththva (reality of soul) is always surprising. Just like one will want to see and know more about something that which is surprising to them, a:thma thaththva is also eternally new that way. Summarizing this, Sri Krishna is moving ahead. Let’s try to learn with more clarity about that verse [verse 2.9]. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 68,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), today we delve into the concept of a:scharya (wonder or amazement). A:scharya is a feeling of amazement, often experienced when encountering something that has not been seen before, leading to wide-open eyes and dropped jaws—it is truly awe-inspiring!\nAs Ma:gha says, \"kshane: kshane: yannavatha:m upayathi thade:va ru:pam\" (at each moment, what is seen appears in a different form). Initially, when we see something, it evokes an \"ah!\" response. However, over time, what once amazed us can become mundane. This is the nature of worldly things.\nFor instance, when we first see a large lawn, it feels wonderful. But after spending ten days there, the amazement fades, as we become accustomed to it. This is true for all worldly experiences. At first encounter, everything seems \"wow.\"\nNow, the reality of the soul (a:thma) is distinct from the reality of nature (prakruthi). They are different truths (thaththva). It is impossible to compare the soul to anything in nature. For example, can we use clay objects to explain what gold is? No, because they are different substances. Similarly, clay, gold, trees, and sticks are all formations of various elements of nature, collectively referred to as prakruthi.\nSa:sthra (scriptures) identifies nature as a formation of five primary elements: earth, fire, water, air, and space, known as pancha bhu:tha:s (five elements). Our sages have shown that everything we see is made up of these elements in different proportions. In physical sciences, many elements have been identified, but according to Vedic teachings, we only need to consider these five basic building blocks.\nThe resulting formation of an object depends on the ratios of these five elements. If one element is more prevalent than the others, it creates a different outcome. However, the soul (a:thma) is a different truth altogether and cannot be compared to anything from nature.\n**SLOKA WORD -**\na:scharyavath pasyathi kaschid e:nam\n**SLOKA MEANING -**\nSomeone sees the soul feeling amazed.\nThere is no comparison because the soul is a unique concept. All that we see are substances of nature. Therefore, if we are asked to show something from nature to explain the soul, it becomes impossible. However, to aid our understanding, we may choose something from nature that is somewhat similar to explain an aspect of the soul.\nWhen discussing the soul, we say that it is anu swaru:pa (of the subtlest form) and possesses jna:na (knowledge) as its quality. The soul releases knowledge from within and retracts it without undergoing any change. One might wonder, \"If it releases and retracts knowledge, won't it diminish?\" This thought arises from observing worldly objects, but we cannot apply that understanding entirely to the soul.\nTo illustrate, consider a di:pa (oil lamp). When lit, it remains stationary, yet its light spreads. We can use this analogy to explain how the soul spreads knowledge. If the soul is in a human body, it can spread knowledge to the extent of that body. In a larger animal, like an elephant, it spreads knowledge to each subtlest part of it.\nHowever, we cannot compare the di:pa's need for oil to the soul, as the soul does not deplete its source of knowledge. The soul can continuously spread knowledge if an appropriate body is formed. This is what sa:sthra teaches us, which is why we seek scripture for understanding the reality of the soul.\nUsing visible objects to explain the soul is not the best method, but it is the only means we have. As one hears about the soul, there is a chance to learn, but it is impossible to fully comprehend or explain it. This is what Lord Krishna explains in verse 2.29.\n**SLOKA WORD -**\na:scharyavath pasyathi kaschid e:nam\n**SLOKA MEANING -**\nSomeone fortunate sees the soul as if knowing or seeing something that has never been known or seen before.\nThe Kata Upanishad states that there could be one among millions who truly understands the soul. This implies that generally, there is no one like that. When one sees the soul, it always seems new, evoking amazement.\nWhen we encounter something new, we often turn to share it with someone nearby. By the time we look back, it feels different than before. This is how the reality of the soul is. The ultimate reality of God (parama:thma) is similarly perceived.\nKrishna is now explaining the reality of the soul to Arjuna. Therefore, Arjuna should not cry for the souls within these bodies. To understand why he should not cry, he must first comprehend the nature of the soul, which is challenging.\nLet’s consider an example: if someone tries to stop steam with their hand or a cloth, does it stop? No, it finds a way around the obstacle. This is not the fault of the person or the tools used; it is simply the nature of steam. Similarly, it is the natural characteristic of the soul to evoke amazement.\n**SLOKA WORD -**\na:scharyavath vadathi thatthaiva cha anyaha\n**SLOKA MEANING -**\nSimilarly, if anyone tries to explain it, it feels new no matter how much they explain.\nNo one can claim to have fully explained the soul, as it is beyond complete comprehension. This is why sa:sthra brings it to light, as it is distinct from all physical objects and eternally new. Therefore, anything related to it will evoke amazement.\nBecause complete knowledge of the soul is unattainable, there is no need to cry about it. Krishna's teaching to Arjuna is that there is no need to grieve for the soul. Thus, even after hearing all this, the soul remains a source of amazement.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), It is amazing to watch birds take off from their nests in the early morning hours. In the evening, birds fly back to their nests, together in a beautiful pattern, in a specific order. If one bird turns, the rest synchronize their movement accordingly; it is amazing. As the clouds in the sky move, we ‘see’ (them taking) various shapes. No one designed them to be that way. However, those shapes don’t remain the same. A cloud formation that looks like a monkey, or a crocodile, or an elephant gradually changes to something else as we continue to look at it. How amazing!\nAs the sun rises or sets, the vibrant red hue that beautifully spreads through the entire sky is so amazing. In the early hours, when we see Earth from above while in an airplane, a line-like image appears on the planet's surface resulting from the rising Sun’s bright light. How amazing! How amazing is it to see the ocean waves approach (the shore) steadily with no breaks! An arc-shaped beautifully colored rainbow that spreads across the sky in the rainy season, just before or after rain… How amazing! Everything is so amazing. In the world, everything we see in Nature is amazing. Because it is always different from what we once saw. It does not always remain the same; it is eternally changing.\nIf Nature itself has various amazing things, making one feel amazed when looked at, it’s not surprising that a:thma (soul), that is distinct from Nature, amazes one no matter how much or how many ways or times we hear about it (a:thma). If a:thma thaththva jna:na (knowledge of the reality of the soul), which is anu (subtle), is so amazing, then how amazing would be the knowledge of parama:thma thaththva jna:na (knowledge of the reality of God)? As vibhu (all-pervading enabler of the entire Universe)? How wonderful and how special would it feel? Such a unique feeling! In fact, anyone who is experiencing something like this would not want to leave it even for a second. If they come out of thinking about it even for half a moment, they would feel like they lost something huge.\nNowadays, our people have habituated little kids with smartphones. Game apps are installed on the phone. The child keeps playing with it. If you ever feel like he is not paying attention to your words and take the phone away from him, he cries as if his house is on fire, shouting “No, no…!” What it implies is that he is experiencing something amazing about it every second. Because he is experiencing that wow feeling, he desires to be with it. He does not want to come away from it or be separated from it. If he is separated from it, he feels like he has lost everything. We notice this in little kids. \nAlso, if anyone is forced away or called for something else when they are with a beloved one, we notice how sorrowful and painful that feels to people, so we are able to relate. People do not want to come out of even such experiences of this world. They generally do not want to talk about the separation. One who is talking about it doesn’t feel he is done talking about it. No matter how much he discusses it, he wants to talk more about it. Some people in the world keep talking about themselves, boasting to anyone who is ready to listen! They continuously talk. All they need is a listener. Even if the other person asks him to stop (feeling irritated), he won’t. Even if the other person tries to turn and move away, they hold them back asking him to listen to one last thing. If someone listens about him, or when he is speaking about what he wants, he feels the experience to be eternally new, so he wants to continue to speak something more. If he notices that the other person isn’t paying attention, he forces him and somehow manages to tell him what he wants to. \nThese are all the things that awe us. A:thma (soul) is the most amazing thaththva (reality). It is indestructible. Hence, there is no need to cry about it. As Sri Krishna teaches this to Arjuna in Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2, He says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:scharyavath pasyathi kaschid e:nam \na:scharyavath vadathi thatthaiva cha:nyaha |\na:scharyavach chainam anyas sruno:thi\nsruthva:py e:nam ve:da na chaiva kaschith ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNo matter what anyone does, they will not know about it completely. However, it continues to amaze them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nLet’s take for example a few worldly items, i.e., a radio. Someone invented it way back. When it was new, everyone wondered about the small box, how it is ‘talking’ and how cool it is! If you turn the knob to another station, some other person talks. We don’t see anyone inside. We hear words, songs, and many various programs. In those times when the radio was new, it felt like a fun magical box. After some time, we felt, is that all a radio is!? It (the awe) is over. The thaththva (reality) in it that made one feel amazed when encountering it the first time becomes less impactful over time. If one continues to look at it, listen to it, or speak about it for a period of time, it feels like there’s nothing much to it.\nThere are two ways. First one. One may feel somewhat indifferent towards something if he spends a lot of time with it. Second one. One may feel uninterested in it if he attains more knowledge in that topic as he knows it all. Later the radio was upgraded with a recording option. How surprising that was back then! Earlier, we would require a separate device to record. Later, we could record on the same device when a program was playing. That was very amazing. Gradually, devices began to evolve. The same device can click a photo, record, re-record, play on speakers for others to hear, etc. As each feature was added, it felt amazing.\nWhen cell phones were new, someone gave us one. He said it is a great device, probably called a roaming phone back then. He gave it to us telling us that we can take it to any place, anywhere we go. It was of just a small size. It felt amazing. We thought we could use it properly. After a month, there was a bill of 25,000. We bid our farewell to it! Post that, we did not venture into any of that again. Even if anyone says they will give it for free, we stay away from it! However, when it was new, it felt amazing. If we see an object for the first time, it amazes us. After spending some time with it, “Oh, that’s all this is.” Also, someone who is more knowledgeable than that would feel, “Oh, that’s all this is.” What happens is that it gets old.\nTVs have come. In the beginning, there were only sounds. Now, [with the advent of TVs] we see images. Someone who is somewhere else is seen [on the TVs], talking to us! We all know certain programs on the TV which give a contact number for one to call. When we call the number, someone interacts. This is even more amazing. Earlier, even if one in the next room, if somehow was visible in another room, it was amazing. Nowadays, people from one town can see others in another town, other countries too! We can see someone in any part of the world from our very room; how amazing this is! This was the case when TVs were new. Now, it’s gotten old.\nComputers have come. It was so amazing when they were new. However, computers are not as amazing anymore. Having reached a state where so much technology is embedded in small devices, it’s not that amazing. Earlier, it was amazing. Gradually, it gets less interesting. As new languages and new packages get installed (over and over), it becomes less amazing. People who used to get intrigued are no longer amazed by them. Airplanes came. When they were new, it felt “Wow, journey in the air!” Nowadays, technology-wise there's so much more. Not only traveling in the airplane, but also (sky)diving from it. On ceremonial days such as Republic Day, military airplanes fly in various patterns. It seems amazing. When an experienced person watches it, he would feel it can be further improvised. It wouldn’t amaze him so much.\nAnother example, a rocket. The airplane (technology) itself was amazing, but rocket technology amazed us furthermore! A speed of twenty-five thousand miles per hour… Oh my! Traveling from one planet to another, amazing! It was amazing when it was new. Once we understand it further, it feels “Oh, that’s it!” Later, we don’t feel amazed as much. We notice this in the world. We see a magician in the world. He shows us a man in a wooden case on a bench. The bench is in the center [of the stage]. He saws the case into half! [Then] He brings the same man back to stage from the other side. Where is he coming from? Oh my! What kind of feat is this? [Now] He brings a cloth. He shows it being empty. Later, he folds it, then unfolds it to bring out a flying dove. Amazing! He brings a box, shows it being empty. He then pulls out something from it. He brings some other material, like pieces of cloth. He puts them in his mouth and ‘pulls them’ out of his ear! Amazing, right? It amazes us; however, if a higher-ranking magician looks at all this, he feels the first magician is only at the building blocks of magic…\nThere are so many such things in the world that are amazing. However, after a period of time, they stop being amazing. A:thma thaththva (the reality of the soul) is not like that. However long we hear about it, speak about it, perceive it… however much we know about it. Arjuna! As it is distinct from those that can be known about… a:scharyavath pasyathi, sruno:thi, vadathi… however much you work on it\nsruthva:py e:nam ve:da na chaiva kaschith (It is impossible for anyone to know about it no matter how much you explain about it). This is a:thma thaththva. Saying this, Sri Krishna began to explain the soul’s innate qualities in verse 2.29 to Arjuna. Let’s move ahead and learn more gradually. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Some people can tell what others are thinking. It’s known as ‘mind reading’. It astonishes us. We are acquainted with a few such people. If anyone visits them, they give them a pen and paper and say, “Write what you want on it, you don’t have to show anyone, keep it with you.” After talking with them for a while, they disclose the aspect that the other person wrote. It matches exactly with what he had written. How astonished will we be?\nOur Ranga Ramanujacharya ji and Ramachandracharya ji went to see Sudharshanacharya ji in Faridabad. They don’t believe in such things. Sudarshanacharya ji said, “If you want to know something, you can write it on paper.” Ranga Ramanujacharya ji replied, “I don’t believe in such things.” Sudarshanacharya ji insisted, “Still, you can write something.” Ranga Ramanujacharya ji wrote something. Sudarshanacharya ji then said, “You are wondering about your son, is that right?” Ranga Ramanujacharya ji never told Sudarshanacharya ji that he had a son or how he is. Sudarshanacharya ji didn’t know anything about him. However, he was able to read the thoughts of other people. Hence, he disclosed it. Ranga Ramanujacharya ji was astonished when he heard it.\nSome ask others, “Write the name of your favorite flower, bird, or number.” After conversing for some time, they reveal precisely what was written and tell him to verify! They also tell if what they are wondering about will happen or not, regardless of what it is. However, we get impressed at his intellect and feel, “Wow, he is reading my mind.” But someone who is more proficient than him might understand the mechanism, which we don’t.\nA:scharya (wonder) means an aspect that is beyond our intellect. Few people can say, “You have a hole in your heart. You have stones in your body. You had an operation during this time. You lost something in the morning, you put it in this place.” When they say that, we are shocked, right? We feel as if he knows so much about God. In this world, there are many aspects that astonish us. When we hear, know, or see about those aspects, they amaze us.\nSri Krishna enlightens Arjuna in chapter 2 about how a:thma thaththva (the reality of the soul) is amazing. Also, we are familiar with many aspects of Nature; they actually are all amazing. Yet a:thma (soul) is more amazing than all these. We cannot compare it with anything. Hence, knowing about it entirely is not possible for anyone.\nVa:lmiki Bhagava:n, in Yuddha Ka:nda (Sri Ra:mayanam), when Ra:ma and Ra:vana are fighting, wanted to compare it with something. However, what do we compare it with? What can match it? Maybe such an extensive war might not have happened in history until that time. Ra:kshasa:s (demonic beings) were around earlier as well, but they were not used to such massive wars. They would terrorize people, forcing them to do what they wished. However, standing against and fighting on a gigantic scale might have started from Rama’s time period. Skirmishes might have taken place here and there. He [Va:lmiki] thought about what he should compare this with.\nNormally we say, “It is happening like the first world war or second world war. It is like the Kargil war.” He [Va:lmiki] looked for something to compare and felt nothing could come close to it. Finally, he said…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nra:ma Ra:va:na yo:ruddham\nra:ma Ra:va:na yo: riva\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe battle between Rama and Ravana is incomparable to anything else.\n-----------------------------------------------\nFinally, he could compare the war between Ra:ma and Ra:vana with the war between Ra:ma and Ra:vana itself. There is no comparison with anything else. You can’t compare it with anything [other than itself]. He [Va:lmiki] wanted to say how incomparable it is.\ngaganam gagana:ka:ra:m (space is as vast as space) Can anyone say space is as wide as my backyard? This is not an appropriate comparison - as clearly nothing is as vast as space. However big something may be, it fits in a small corner in space. Be it the earth, solar system, Milky Way, or the entire universe… all of them fit within space but cannot be larger than it. Hence, we can’t compare space with anything. If someone asks, “How vast is space?”, one can only reply “as vast as space.” That means he understood very well, 100 marks for him!\n“How vast is the ocean?” If someone asks how big a village’s lake is, we can say it's as big as the ocean. Or the Pulikat river, we can say it's as big as the ocean. Yet, if someone asks how vast the ocean is, and someone responds it’s as big as the lake behind, people mock him.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsa:ga:ra sa:garo:pama\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe ocean is as big as the ocean - we can’t compare it with anything.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHence Va:lmiki said,                   \n                 ra:ma Ra:va:na yo:ruddham\n                 ra:ma Ra:va:na yo: riva\nVa:lmiki gave this example to state that it is incomparable. What do we compare a:thma thaththva (the reality of the soul) with? Only when we compare it with something do we get some jna:na (knowledge) about it. Otherwise, however much we hear about it, it remains incomprehensible. We can’t say, “Aha, we understood it.” Do we have an example to compare it with [a:thma]?\nA:thma is the one with knowledge. In Nature, no objects have knowledge. If we can witness knowledge in anything, it is because of the indwelling soul (ji:va) within. For example, if we put an obstacle in front of a growing plant, it bends to the side where there is sunlight and continues to grow from there. That means it has intelligence, right? Where is this knowledge coming from? It is the knowledge of the soul inside the visible plant, not the plant’s. If the ji:va (soul) comes out of it, then it is simply the [form of a] plant. Then it doesn't bend to the side or grow new leaves.\nWe see this in an example of a plant. It is the same with everything. There is a certain “touch-me-not” plant. It is called lajjavathi in Sanskrit. If we touch it, it shrinks all its leaves, bends down, and becomes slender. The plant which was wide earlier has shrunk now. Even if we touch one leaf, the whole plant becomes slender. It means that it has knowledge. It knows to shrink when someone touches it. Hence, it shrank. That is as long as the ji:va is inside it. Once the ji:va goes out of it, the leaves won’t shrink or expand.\nJna:na (knowledge) is an intrinsic characteristic of the soul. Scriptures have told us this. There is no need to ask if you have seen this. We know knowledge is the soul's characteristic. If there is something like it, we can compare it with the soul. However, if there is any thaththva (reality) which has knowledge, it is only parama:thma (supreme soul), thaththva. Hence, we can compare it with parama:thma. We can say it is like parama:thma and has consciousness like it. However, parama:thma is called vibhu (incomparably large), thaththva.\nWhatever we compare with, we should have knowledge of that first. If we say someone’s face is like the moon, we should know how the moon is. Only then can we compare and see if it is like the moon or not. Hence, if we have knowledge about the parama:thma thaththva, then we can compare a:thma thaththva with it. However, if we don’t know about a:thma thaththva itself, then how can we know about parama:thma thaththva? Hence, in however many ways you hear about or discuss a:thma, it cannot be known.\nIf it can’t be known, then why make efforts to know it? What it implies is that it is something that can’t be known completely or in its entirety. The essence is that however much you know about it, there is a lot that needs to be known. It is called a:scharya (wonder). \nOnce a frog from the ocean came to a frog who was in a well. The frog which used to be in the ocean became friends with the frog in the well. The frog in the well asked, “Where are you coming from, my friend?” The frog from the ocean replied, “I am coming from the ocean.” The frog in the well asked, “What is there in the ocean?” The frog from the ocean said, “It has water.” The frog in the well asked, “Water, is it like water in the well?” The frog from the ocean replied, “Something like that.” The frog in the well asked, “How much water is there?” The frog from the ocean said, “Lots.” The frog in the well asked, “Is it this much [while swimming from one side of the well to the other]?” The frog in the ocean replied, “No.” The frog in the well asked, “Or is it from here to there [while swimming from one end to the other end]?” \nThe frog in the well only knows the well and can only swim within the boundaries of the well. How can it understand the length, width, or depth of the ocean even if explained extensively? Just as it can’t know the ocean’s entirety in spite of being explained repeatedly, deciding about the reality of a:thma [in its entirety] is not possible for anyone. However many times you talk about it, there is a lot more. However many times you listen about it, yet there is a lot more. However much you know about it, there is still a lot more. Hence, whatever you heard or understood about it is very limited. A:thma is always amazing.\nAll great jna:nis (wise ones), the wise ones like rushis (sages), munis (saints), and tha:thvikas (ultimate realities) like Sri Krishna, call it amazing too. If someone claims, “We have seen a:thma. We can enable you to see it in five minutes,” …what should we think of such a person? That is also ‘amazing’. If someone says they have seen a:thma and know all about it, we have to realize he is making a fool of us. We have to be amazed at their brazenness. Hence, Arjuna, thinking that you know something about a:thmas, there is no need to cry about Bhi:shma’s and Dro:na’s a:thmas, the soul is ajara:maram (eternally indestructible). Motivating Arjuna to wage war, Sri Krishna continues Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2.\nJai Srimannarayana! Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 71,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Some people feel very sad when they don’t know what others know. They desire to know more than anyone else. When others seem to have more knowledge than he does, then he feels sad. He feels sad that others are advancing ahead of him in knowledge. Arjuna also experienced a type of pain. What is that pain? That others know a:thma thaththva (the reality of the soul). Sri Krishna assures Arjuna, not to worry about it. In chapter 2, He says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“I bow again and again to the one who removes all obstacles and grants all wealth.”\n-----------------------------------------------\n“So, you need not worry.” In chapter 2, Arjuna felt sorrow at the start of the war. He experienced two types of sorrow. First, the sorrow of having to kill the armies assembled for battle. He felt sad when he noticed the many relatives that he had to kill. Second, he had to face the venerated elder, Bhi:shma, and his a:cha:rya (teacher), Dro:na - to wage war upon, attack, and hurt them. He must be relieved from this sorrow. To do that, he needs to be educated on who the people he is facing are… and the what, why, and how of his relationship with them. Arjuna also needed to be made aware of his responsibility. Without knowing it, he would not be free from his sorrow. He wouldn’t be ready for war unless he was first free from sorrow. Without the war, what needed to happen wouldn’t take place. Hence, Lord Sri Krishna first began to help Arjuna relieve his sorrow. He said, “No need to mourn for visible bodies.” “Nor is there a need to mourn for a:thmas (souls), the souls dwelling within.” “Then why cry?” Therefore, He thought of pacifying him, initially by speaking about bodies. He spoke about the visible objects [bodies] first, and the invisible ones [a:thmas] later. As the bodies are visible, He said, “No need to mourn as they cannot be preserved, despite one’s best efforts.” Even if you leave them aside without doing anything, will they last?\nEarlier, we heard about our great elders and revered forefathers. They are the reason for our existence. However, we do not see them today. When it was time, they left us. Their bodies survived for a certain allotted time, must have completed the activities assigned, and disappeared after that. Or they were made to disappear through rituals such as cremation on death or by other means. They are not visible now. They [bodies] did not stop [from becoming invisible]. Not anyone’s! Once in Moscow, they tried to preserve Lenin’s body so it wouldn’t decay. His body was positioned in a standing posture for some time. Maintaining it became highly expensive. Then they saw no use in maintaining it, spending large amounts of money. Then they placed it in a reclining position, which is how it is now. Apparently, they continued to spend approx $2000 per day for its upkeep. It’s hard to estimate how long it could be maintained that way. Since they are able to bear the costs to maintain it, the statue is holding its shape today. If they are unable to spend on its maintenance, then the body will stink, decay and fall apart if touched. Change [in the body] cannot be stopped by any means. So, don’t mourn if the bodies in front of you change, because that is their very nature. Therefore, there’s no use mourning them.\nArjuna asked, “They are my relatives. How can I not grieve upon losing them?” Sri Krishna replied, “Though they are your relatives, they took a form to carry out good activities.” “It is our responsibility to encourage them when they perform good deeds.” “Similarly, they must be stopped when they commit wrong acts and… you have a responsibility towards ensuring that.” “Arjuna, since you are an able ruler, you have this responsibility.” “You must, therefore, dissuade and stop those who are committing wrongful acts.” If they don’t back down, you must punish and stop them. If they continue to resist, then you must eliminate them, and ensure those wrong acts do not happen. You have come here prepared to wage war against Kauravas, who are in that situation. Not just you and I, the whole world declares that they committed sins. Because they tried to burn you [Pa:ndavas] and your house, poisoned and tried to drown you, and tricked and cheated you in gambling to steal your kingdom. Besides these, they tried to disrobe a woman and insulted her in the palace court. What else is worse than such horrible acts?! They deserve to be punished for such wickedness. Many have tried to reason with them. I also took your message and tried to convince them. Elders such as Bhi:shma, Dro:na, and other elders have tried as well. Kauravas are not in a state to listen to anyone, and have come prepared to fight you. You are now faced with a genuine opportunity to punish them in the war, and have a responsibility to eliminate them if necessary. In the pretext of war, you will be doing them a favor. Whether it is your relatives’ bodies or your elders’ bodies, you do not need to mourn for them. You don’t have to mourn for the bodies,” said Sri Krishna.\nAs discussed earlier, anything visible is called bhu:tha (element). Bodies are made up of five cosmic elements i.e. pancha bhu:thas (five elements). Bhu:tha means one which takes a shape and gradually changes with time. Changes happen due to the association of the indwelling soul responsible for consciousness. Unbeknownst to us, there is a soul within. Because the soul is the cause of everything, Arjuna might be feeling sad for the soul. In chapter 1, Arjuna says -\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npathanthi pitharo: hye:sha:m\nluptha pindo:daka kriya:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“My elders and forefathers who died and are now in heaven, will fall [to lower worlds] if they are deprived of the sacrificial offerings from this plane.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat it means is that they had already cremated his forefathers’ bodies with rituals when they died. The elders and forefathers who you are speaking about in the higher worlds…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnarake: niyatham va:so:\nbhavathi:thy anu susruma\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“This hell, and the punishment one endures there, is that for this physical body? No.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThat body completed its journey here [in this world]. Hence, Arjuna himself stated that… it is the souls of his forefathers which were associated with those bodies, that travel there… that experience comforts, pain, or fall [to lower worlds]. These acts are not happening to the body as it got ‘disposed off’ here in this world. So who goes to heaven and has experiences? It is the soul. It means Arjuna is well aware of the soul existing differently than the body. You are aware of that and it is a fact. Because sa:sthra (scriptures), declared it. Mourning, even for the soul, is not necessary. Why is it not necessary? The scripture that proclaims that the soul exists and is different from the body, also says that the soul is subtle and indestructible. So why mourn for something indestructible? One could feel sad for things that can get destroyed. However, if it is undamageable, why cry about the soul? There is no need. Arjuna is speaking as if he ‘knows’ that the soul exists, but seems to have forgotten about its key characteristics and is experiencing sorrow. Sri Krishna thus had to expound on the realities of both thaththvas (truths) - body and soul, to Arjuna and began the explanation. He said…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:scharyavath pasyathi kaschid e:nam\na:scharyavath vadathi thatthaiva cha:nyaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“A:thma swaru:pam (the innate nature of the soul) is a wonder. Not just for you or me, but for everyone.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is impossible to learn everything about the soul. It is impossible for anyone. If someone claims they counted all the grains of earth’s sand. How does it sound? We say they must be bluffing. One cannot even count the grains in a handful of sand! We can only pity the one who makes such tall claims. He is either innocent or crazy and gets laughed at as well. Similarly, if someone gives the exact count of stars in the universe, we feel the same way. Because all these are limitless and cannot be comprehended in entirety. Knowledge of the soul is also like that! Therefore, Sri Krishna says whoever says vadathi (speaks), he is uktva:pi na ve:da (even if he speaks, he does not know), whoever says sruno:thi (hears), he is sruthva:pi na ve:da (even if he hears, he does not know). Whoever says pasyathi (sees), he is drushtva:pi na ve:da (even if he sees, he does not know). It means, even if one claims that they learned everything there is, or spoken about, or seen everything there is, he still does not know everything. However, some of it can be imagined, as our mind is great. It can imagine things with advanced visuals. It knows well how to wander about in a virtual reality. Thus, the mind can imagine certain things. However, even such thoughts cannot comprehend the soul. What types of thoughts? Imagine a needle, with a plate resting on its tip, another needle situated above it and… a mountain perched on top of that needle… and that you stood atop this mountain with the whole sky above your head. Your mind can visualize all this. What do we say about this? Immense graphical imagination. It is possible. Despite whatever you can imagine, it is impossible to fully grasp a:thma thaththva jna:na (knowledge of the soul). Some might claim though, that they have full knowledge of the soul’s reality. They might define the soul’s characteristics as this and that. In chapter 2, Sri Krishna, however, clarified that reality cannot be grasped with our limited abilities. Some things are abhu:tho:pama (non-existent comparisons), they don’t exist but can be imagined. Such as Lord Brahma having 1000 heads, or someone having 2000 tongues or the Sun and Moon arising at the same time. In further chapters in Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndivi su:rya sahasrasya:\nbhave:th yugapad utthitha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“… even if 1000 suns arise …”\n-----------------------------------------------\nBut these events don’t actually occur. It implies that even if such visualizations occur, they won’t match the current object of comparison, a:thma thaththva jna:na (knowledge of the soul). How much ever one speaks, acts, or thinks about the soul, one cannot understand it in totality. It is indestructible. This is what our scripture says. Therefore, no need to feel sorrow about such a soul! Not for anyone! … na kaschid veda: (no one knows). In that case, why should you worry about it? Sri Krishna gave an amazing explanation on the wondrous details of the soul to Arjuna, to alleviate his sorrow. Let’s move ahead, learning further about this. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), some people masquerade as all-knowing in order to deceive society around them. They speak as if they know it all. They act like they control everything. They claim they can achieve anything. Not only now, it has been this way for a long time.\nOnce a well-versed scholar visited the royal court of King Sri Krishna Deva Raya. He claimed to know everything and that he would defeat anyone [in debate]. Everyone was worried seeing his demeanor. He spoke about certain topics in the royal court. He exhibited his ‘vast knowledge’ and ‘expertise’ to those in the court. Everyone got a bit worried.\nOn that day, [the jester] Tena:li Ra:makrushna was not in the court’s attendance. It came to a point where everyone seemed to be defeated. That scholar then demanded, “O, King! Present me with a royal note that… this court has accepted my vast expertise … and admit that I won and defeated everyone in this court!” Maha:ra:ja, King [Sri] Krishna Deva Raya didn’t know what to do. He said, “Let's wait. We‘ll adjourn the court for today and decide on it tomorrow.”\nTena:li Ra:makrushna was away on a week’s leave. The king then canceled his leave and summoned him to come at once to the court. Ra:makrushna arrived at the court and asked, “Hey Maha:ra:ja! What is the issue?” The king said, “Our fame is in danger now. Our court is about to be disgraced. An unknown scholar came to our court for a challenge. Everyone is tongue-tied in his presence! They all were defeated. The scholar is demanding a royal note declaring his victory!”\nRa:makrushna said, “Oh! Is that right, Maha:ra:ja? Shall I do something about it?” The king said, “That’s why I summoned you.” Ra:makrushna said, “O great one! It will certainly be taken care of. When [should I do it]?” The king replied, “We adjourned the court for today. Tomorrow the decision must be made to present a royal note declaring we all were defeated. It is now up to you to protect our dignity. We are resting our hopes on you.”\nRa:makrushna continued, “O great king! My duty is to obey your order. I’ll never shatter your hopes.” He agreed to take care of it. He showed up at the royal court the next morning. The well-versed scholar also arrived there. He asked, “Who are you?” Ra:makrushna replied, “O great one! I heard you are a sarvajna (all-knowing).” The scholar said, “Yes. You may ask anyone in this court about it!”\nRa:makrushna continued, “O great one! Very happy to hear. I do have a question, however. If you could answer my question, then I have no qualms in accepting you as sarvajna.” The scholar demanded, “Go ahead and ask!” Ra:makrushna asked, “How many crows are there in our village?! How many crows are there in our village?” He [the puzzled scholar] thought he [Ra:makrushna] would ask something from sa:sthras (scriptures), or tarka (logic) or mi:ma:msa (philosophy) or vya:karana (grammar). He simply asked, “How many crows are there?”.\nHow would the scholar respond to this question? He sat there bewildered! A rule exists in [such a] debate. If I ask you a question and you are unable to answer it, then I must provide the answer. Only then will I be deemed the winner. I’ll be considered ineligible for the debate if I ask a question for which even I do not know the answer. The scholar remembered this rule then and demanded, “Alright, I do not know, however, you should know the answer… speak, how many crows are there in your village?”\nRa:makrushna chuckled and said, “O great one! I’ll give the answer. You do not know the answer, right? If you first write down a note that you lost as you do not know about it, then I’ll reveal the answer.” First of all, he clearly averted the impending threat from the scholar. Then the scholar wrote it down and bellowed, “Now tell us how many crows are there in your village?!” Ra:makrushna responded, “O great one! In our village, at this instant, there are a total of 92,345 crows. That is 92,345.”\nThe scholar asked the King, “O great king! This is a deceit! This is trickery. You have a responsibility to verify this immediately. Have the crows counted in your village right away! O king! You owe us a validation of the answer and assign a few people immediately to count these crows!” Ra:makrushna then said to the king, “If Your grace permits, I would like to submit a request.” The king said, “Go ahead.” Ra:makrushna then turned to the scholar and said, “Hey pundit (knowledgeable one), if you would allow as well, I have a request.” The scholar angrily said, “What is that?” Ra:makrushna gently said, “It's just that the count I gave is only valid… for this instant i.e. 92,345 crows. Once the search begins, the number might change with new crows coming in as guests from other villages. There might be a few crows that would have left to visit their relatives in other villages. I cannot help if the count changes due to these. O great king! However, today and for now the exact census is 92,345 crows.”\nWhat can the scholar do now!? When will the committee be formed? When will they get to plan and prepare? When will they start and how many days would have lapsed by then? Also, how to count the crows that left the village? How to make out the crows that are visiting from outside? How to count them? To protect the dignity of the royal court, to uphold the honor of their kingdom… he won that argument only by his argumentative ability. In reality, did he actually count the crows in the village or know about their whereabouts? Even if we ignore this, if someone claims he knows everything… then we would just pity him for thinking crazily.\nSimilarly, if someone claims they know everything there is about a:thma (the reality of the soul), then we must pity him as well. Sri Krishna says… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:scharyavath pasyathi …\na:scharyavath vadathi … \na:scharyavath … sruno:thi  [BG 2.29]\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever speaks about a:thma (the soul), whatever is spoken about it… and how much ever is spoken about it… it [the soul] will continue to be an amazing wonder. Despite contemplating on it a lot, there is no one who will grasp it in its entirety.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna thus proposes about the soul in Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, verse 29. One gets ridiculed if they claim they can control the entire sky with their hands. It's laughable if they say, ‘I chopped the sky to pieces and pulverized it’. We feel pity for him… that he may have gone crazy and need to be treated for mental illness at a hospital. We hear of many such people in the world that speak about the a:thma (soul) this way. That they know everything there is about the soul. Not just that they are knowledgeable, but that they can help others realize the soul in just 5 seconds or 5 minutes. We pity such people as well!\nIt means, similar to how it is not possible to comprehend the sky … it is just as difficult to grasp everything about the soul in entirety. Arjuna seemed uninterested to discuss the soul and made a face as if to say… “Why should I pine for such an obscure thing? Why would You try to convince me of its reality? Why would You try to waste my time on it? Actually, I do not want to broach this topic at all and do not want to know about it.” \nSeeing this, Lord Krishna said, “If you truly do not care about the soul, then why mourn for it? I’ve declared earlier not to mourn for the bodies. You seem to be mourning a little for the body and a little for the soul as well. Because you are in agony you are saying, If I kill these people I’ll go to hell. Or maybe they will go to hell. They will be disgraced. They will fall to the lower worlds from their worlds. Why do you say such things? Since you speak this way, it implies that you are aware that the soul is separate from the body. You have that feeling and are thinking about it. That is why it became imperative to explain that there is no need to mourn for the soul. Because as per the scripture, the soul is nithyam (eternal). You cannot say that I neither need to know nor care about it. Because you speak as if you know about it already. You speak as if you know about bodies and that you know about souls. You say that you will not fight the war to avoid the sin which you might accrue by destroying these two [body and soul] and that you would like to roam in the forests… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsre:yo: bho:kthum bhaiksham api:ha lo:ke: [BG 2.5]\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAnd you say that it’s better to beg for alms than to fight and kill them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is clear that what you know is not genuine knowledge. It is your duty to acquire the right knowledge. Therefore, it is incorrect or unnecessary to think that if you fight with the bodies… to fulfill your duty then they would be at a loss. It is your duty alone to stop those that are at fault. So you have to do that. Since you think you are knowledgeable about the soul, I am telling you what this [truly] is. If one cannot learn about it despite all efforts, then why should one learn about it? What it means by ‘cannot be learnt about’ is that you may learn what you need to about it… and what fits your stature or role [but not everything there is].’\nWhen you approach an ocean, take what you need from it. It does not mean then that whatever you possess is the entire ocean. There is more to it. Because there is more but you cannot see all of it, will you stop enjoying at least what you possess? No, right? You only need a small amount of water from the river. You take that and leave the rest in the flowing current. A:thma thaththva jna:na (knowledge of the soul’s reality) is also similar. Whether it is the sages or the great people or the scholars, they keep learning about the soul. However, they realize what they know [about the soul] is not comprehensive!\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyasya amathi mithi matham, thasya matham …\nyasya: matham thasya matham\nmatham yasya na vedasaha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nUpanishads state that if someone claims, ‘I know everything about the soul and… there is nothing more to learn’ then it means he is just a fool and that he doesn’t know anything at all.\n-----------------------------------------------\nOn the contrary, if anyone says, “I strived many years to learn about the soul, thought I knew a lot about it… but I realized that what I knew is just half of a water drop in an ocean of knowledge of the soul… oh my! There is still so much more to learn!” …that person is truly a knowledgeable one. … yasya amatham ithi matham, thasya matham … One who humbly says it's impossible to learn everything about the soul, it indicates he must know something about it.\nThe great Ku:raththa:lwan once stated \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvyoma:m bho:ja idamthaya:khila midan\nbhra:ntho:yam ithyuchchate:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Gagana kusumam (sky flower), why would I not know about it? It is so beautiful, bright red and lush.” Anyone who speaks this way is just a fool.\n-----------------------------------------------\nGaganam (sky) means sky and kusumam (flower) means a flower. There are flowers and there are skies as well. But flowers growing out of the sky is an impossible phenomenon. This won’t happen. “Since I know everything, I know about that [soul] as well.” It implies that anyone who says this is just an ignorant person and a fool. “Knowledge of the soul is also like that. No one should think that they know everything about it. However much you learn about it, you still do not know it well.\nThe reason I ask you to not mourn for the soul is because it cannot be destroyed. Because Ve:das (scriptures) and the scriptures that give knowledge of the soul proclaim this, we must follow it. We must learn the way it teaches us, we must speak the way it asks us to. We must only believe the way it explains to us. We cannot, therefore, talk about it in whichever we feel like or know. Therefore Arjuna, there is no need for you to mourn for the body and no need to mourn for the soul. Since both are not needed, do not contemplate on the impact of war … losses you might incur, where they might go [after they are killed]... or what difficulties they might face. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkatham bhi:shmam aham sankhye:\ndro:nam cha madhusu:dana!...\nishubhih prathiyo …. [BG 2.4]\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNo need to cry or feel sad with such thoughts. Just move ahead by waging the duty-bound war properly.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nAs part of chapter 2, in the process of teaching about his duty, Sri Krishna explains to Arjuna the knowledge of the soul’s reality. He tries to alleviate his sorrow. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 73,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Sri Krishna embarked on an initiative to alleviate Arjuna’s sorrow and guide him towards his duty. Arjuna’s sorrow is a result of his inability to perceive the body and the soul as separate entities. Sri Krishna began to clearly explain deha (body) and dehi (soul) to Arjuna. \nDeha (body) is formed by the amalgamation of a few elements. The one that utilizes this deha is dehi (soul). They are different. He is demonstrating the difference between the two, deha and dehi. He is also describing their attributes and nature. Among them, ‘What is the nature of the body?’ ‘Why is the soul invisible?’ He [Sri Krishna] has the responsibility to explain these now.\nOur Elders categorized the perceivable bodies into four types:\n1) deva (celestial beings)\n2) manushya (humans)\n3) thiryak (animals)\n4) stha:vara (immobile/stationary)\nIt’s one type of categorization at the gross level. We all belong to the manushya category. Different colors, creed, race, groups, different parties, different amounts of wealth, assets, etc. There are differences in various other ways. We see people of different languages, nationality, qualities, and habits. Even though we see various differences due to these factors, our Elders categorized us as manushya based on the common trait of ‘walking upright’. Thus, all manushyas are segregated into one category.\nThere are other beings that ‘move in a horizontal position’ apart from those who ‘walk upright’. These can move in the water, on the land, on both water and land, in the sky and on land, etc. Several such creatures exist. Because they ‘move in a horizontal position’ they are named as thiryak jathi (horizontal moving beings). This is another category. One category moves in an upright position and another type moves in a horizontal position: manushya and thiryak.\nThere are others that do not move. They may or may not have life energy in them. They could be trees, plants, thorns, bushes, etc. There is life energy in these. Rocks and stones are others where life energy is not obvious. Whether life energy is visible or not, or exists in them or not, stationary ones are known as stha:varas (stationary beings). It is possible that they could be moved to another place with effort from others. But it is not possible for trees, rocks, or water to move by themselves. \nBut water flows, right? If there is a slope then it will, otherwise it won’t. They have tides, right? If there is wind, then water moves as tides, otherwise no. Those that cannot move ‘naturally’ are known as stha:varas. Therefore, these are three categories – manushya, thiryak, and stha:vara [from among the four]. There are many extraordinary energies surrounding us that enable stationary movement, traveling, growth, and depreciation of the three groups. The entities that give us the wind, sunshine, heat, cold, etc. are known as deva jathi (celestial beings). Scriptures state that they are also living beings. Thus - deva, thiryak, manushya, and stha:vara.\nSo basically, the four types are deva, manushya, thiryak, and stha:vara at a high level. All these types have deha (body) and dehi (soul). Deha is externally visible and dehi is within. That is why [firstly] deha must be shown. Its characteristics must be explained. After that, an effort must be made to impart knowledge of atma tattva (reality of the soul). To explain the invisible [soul] entity, one must first explain the [related] visible entity [body].\nOur Elders, the wise, state… sthu:la arundhati nya:yam (the principle of showing the visible to understand the invisible). Earlier, couples used to wed at night. They used to be very young as well. The boy would be around 12 and the girl around 8 years old. Very young. They would be so tired and tend to fall asleep at their own wedding! After certain rituals, they would be shown arundhati, a certain star in the eastern sky. Where is arundhati star in the sky? No one knows it. But it must be shown. How? \nFirst, they [the priests] ask the couple to look toward the east. ‘Do you see the stars there?’ ‘Yes’. The priest would make them see it. ‘Do you see the group of four stars that look like legs of a bed?’ Their vision is now gradually zeroed in on a specific location. ‘Yes, we can see those big four stars that resemble the legs of a bed.’ ‘Correct. Now do you see a tail next to this group?’ They look carefully...‘yes, we see a tail as well’. ‘How many [stars] do you see in it?’ ‘1, 2, 3… we see 3 stars.’ ‘Alright! Now, do you see the middle one of those 3 stars?’ ‘Yes we see the middle star’. ‘Do you see anything close to it?’ ‘Yes, we see a small star flickering next to it.’ ‘That’s arundhati.’ \nThus, to show the arundhati star, they started with a big constellation, gradually zeroing in on it. In sastra (scripture), this is known as sthu:la arundhati nya:yam. Similarly, one must navigate from visible to invisible. ‘From known to unknown’. This is the injunction. Because one must first discuss known aspects to perceive the unknown… as the sharira (body) is known, its characteristics should be presented first… that they are the result of an unknown hidden entity called shariri (soul).\nWe can see that bodies are made up of varied colors, ethnicities, professions, names, etc. Therefore, these visible bodies have varied ethnicity, their characteristics… the places they roam, the timeframes they exist in… some are soft that can be pierced such as fruits… while others are hard such as rocks that cannot be easily pierced. A few such bodies are known as subhedhya:lu (easily pierced) while a few others are called as durbhedhya:lu (not easily pierced). With so many variations, all the visible ones are called dehas (bodies). \nWhat is deha? One that is formed by the combination of a few elements. We alluded to the differences between sharira and deha earlier. They both refer to the same [body]. It is named differently because the underlying process is different. Names are derived based on it [underlying process]. diha upachaye is a [Sanskrit] root. This root indicates that it, the body, is formed by incorporating a few entities with itself. That is known as deha. \nAfter forming, it begins to gradually disintegrate. That is known as sharira. It is called sharira as it disintegrates. It is called deha as it grows after the formation. A baby from birth to approximately 25 years old will have a growing body. With the food he consumes and the water he takes in, he gradually adds to himself and grows. The stage during which the body grows by accumulation is called deha. After a certain age, the body’s abilities diminish slowly. He has wrinkled skin, a bent body, and needs a stick to walk. It means his body has begun to deplete in a way. When such depletion starts, it is then called sharira. When it grows it is called deha. When it depletes it is called sharira. Both refer to the same visible material, the body.\nThere must be something indwelling without which these changes cannot be supported. That [indweller] who is the cause for all these changes is known as dehi (soul), one that has deha. Or known as shariri (soul), one that has sharira. The body shape goes through changes constantly. So we wonder whether the indweller (soul) goes through similar changes. The soul does not experience any changes. So, what does it experience? It can only experience happiness or sorrow. The body, despite being made up of many visible entities, does not laugh, cry, feel happy, or sorrow. \nIf it were to have these feelings, then even upon its death that dead body should have the feelings of laughter or sadness. It should also cry along with others. It should also pacify others, ‘Don’t cry, don’t cry [for me]’. But it doesn’t. If others are fanning the body, then it should feel good too. But it doesn’t. It means, happiness or sadness is not for any visible body. It is meant for what is inside i.e. dehi (soul). His experiences are different from that of the body - nationality, timezone, race, ethnicity, gender are all applicable to the visible external entity, the body. They do not apply to what is within the soul. \nHowever, what he [soul] has, is to feel favorable or unfavorable experiences. If he feels favorable [about something], he feels that as happiness. If he feels the opposite/unfavorable [about something], he feels that as sadness. These are what the soul has. We are referring to him as a human. In fact, we do not refer that [human] to the external visible body. The name is for the indwelling soul visible in that form [human body]. We are naming the one who has manushyathvam (human traits), a man’s traits. We are naming the one who has pashuthvam (animal traits). We are naming the one who has pakshithvam (bird traits). All the names must therefore be applied to the souls within.\nAtma paryantham (to the soul), the changes happen only due to the presence of atma (soul), otherwise they are all the same. They all become pancha bhutas (five cosmic elements). When they are cremated or buried or left idle, they will return to their original state. They get names only due to the presence of souls. There is a chance that one might wonder that since the externally visible bodies are anithya (impermanent), could the souls within be anithya as well? \nIn the earlier instance, there is a chance one might question whether the souls also have a color, a shape like the bodies do. But the indwelling one does not have them. That is why these souls can exist in a human’s body, a bird’s body, an animal’s body, a tree’s body, or a rock’s body. He can transmigrate into any body. Irrespective of the body he takes, he will not imbibe that body’s nature. But due to ignorance, he thinks that they [body’s nature] are his… and he ends up experiencing happiness or sadness attained through the body. \nWe might wonder whether the indweller’s (soul’s) shape also changes similarly to the external body. If it does, then we have to mourn for the soul. As bodily changes cannot be stopped, there is no need to mourn for it. “Since the body is changing, the soul might be changing too. Should I not mourn for it?” “Bhisma and Drona are going through changes too. Why should I not mourn for them?” In chapter 2 verse 30, Sri Krishna recognized such a feeling in Arjuna and began to answer.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndehi nithyam avadhyo:yam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe one that indwells in the body is called dehi (soul). He is nithyam (eternal), exists in past, present, and future. Avadhyaha (he cannot be killed by anyone).\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhere? For whom? … de:he: sarvasya bha:ratha! (Not just in this body, he will not die in any body). What that implies is… thasma:th sarva:ni bhu:tha:ni na thvam so:chithum arhasi || BG 2.30 (Therefore, you need not cry for any being - not Bhisma or Drona or any relatives... thinking about possible changes or the resulting outcomes that might occur because of what you do). \nWhy? You think you are crying for Bhisma or Drona. What about the elephants, horses, and other animals over there? What about the ants or other organisms that might die as your chariot moves about [in the war field]? Why do you not cry for them? There is no need to mourn for anyone. You cannot stop the changes in the body. Shariri (soul) or dehi (soul), the soul within the body is … nithyam avadhyaha (eternal and cannot ever be killed), no need to mourn for it as well. \nThasma:th (therefore) na thvam so:chithum arhasi (you need not cry). Sri Krishna is elevating us a step higher. He is also enlightening us about all the other visible beings around us. First, Sri Krishna explained it about one specific person (Bhisma/Drona) that Arjuna knew. Later in chapter 2, Sri Krishna generalized the particular instance and clarified that there is no need to mourn for anyone. Let's continue to learn about this. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), some souls are bestowed with a human body to perform certain activities. Others may be bestowed with an animal body, or tree body, or other bodies. We call ourselves humans. We got this human body to perform certain activities. Our scriptures outline what those activities are. Society also educates us on this. These activities don’t necessarily give happiness. We need not assume that they will always give favorable experiences.\nA sprinter aiming for a gold medal persistently practices running before he secures it. It gets difficult, his legs get cramped, he sweats profusely, and runs out of breath. Even then, he does not mind those hardships and tolerates them. Because his duty is to practice, he continues to do so rigorously. Because he has a goal, he achieves it. Of all species, only humans, i.e., we, have the ability to recognize life’s goal. What is our life’s goal? What should we know our goal to be? In fact, our current educational system gives zero knowledge of that goal. If we don’t know the goal, how do we strive for it?\nThese days, no one is thinking about how we can put this body to use. If my goal is to win a gold medal in a race, I will practice the means, running. If it is to attain a gold medal in chess, then I will play chess regularly and gain experience. If it is to secure a gold medal in swimming, then I will practice swimming diligently. I will then achieve it. If one knows the purpose of human life, then he will take up an appropriate activity to achieve it. What is that goal? Don’t know. Why are you doing sa:dhana (dedicated practice)? Why are you going to school? Why are you studying? Why are you working?\nToday one thinks there is only one goal: to earn money! Greedy for money, he is willing to go to any length. He wants to earn that money by any means, even selling his soul… or God or his body or anything. For many, earning money has become their goal! Therefore, they don’t mind resorting to any corrupt activity to earn money. What will that money get him when there is a need? These days many are contracting Covid-19, [during the COVID-19 pandemic]. Is money protecting them? When admitted to the hospital, they are charged lakhs of rupees. When he dies, it’s the usual process. This money is not useful. Actually, money (by itself) is never useful. Money is useful only when it helps to procure something else. What is that something else? He cannot eat money. He cannot drink money. He can get something in exchange for money. But money itself cannot help. Money is not the end goal of this life. But something else is. The human body is obtained to learn what that ‘something’ is!\nScriptures, sages, and maha:nubhavas (great beings) such as the gurus of a lineage educate and guide us on the goal of life. That is why, in the earlier days, a child would be admitted in a gurukula (traditional school for Vedic studies), where he gets upanayan (sacred thread) and is trained with appropriate vijna:na (knowledge) for 12, 16, 20, or 24 years as a residential student. Once he is enlightened with knowledge of the goal, they would then be able to send him out to live life in various professions. There was a defined goal, but today, we forgot what the goal is.\nIf we know our goal, as mentioned, let’s assume the goal is to win a gold medal, or reach another town. Along the way, one may face heat, rain, wind, mud, or thorny bushes. Since the goal is to reach there, he tolerates these obstacles, right? He must bear them, right? He cannot ponder whether the path is smooth or difficult. He cannot end his journey and stay wherever he feels comfortable along the way. If there is a shade-giving tree on the route, bearing flowers and fruits, he cannot take shelter under the tree to enjoy its fragrance and fruits and feel content about the journey, stopping because it is comfortable there.\nIn Ra:ma:yana, many traveled with Bharatha to request Ra:ma to return. They came upon sage Bharadwa:ja’s ashramam (hermitage) on the way. The sage offered hospitality for all. Everyone started to enjoy his hospitality. That night in the ashramam, the great sage manifested many wonderful facilities. He provided plenty of food, drinks, entertainment, and enjoyment to their heart’s content. Everything he created was amazing. No item was omitted. His creation on that day was better than anything today’s advanced technology can provide. He asked everyone to enjoy them. Why? Since they are all going to visit Ra:ma with devotion, he felt his service to them is worth offering as they are greatly devoted to Ra:ma. But their perspective changed. They fully indulged in food, drinks, experiences, and desired to stay there!\n‘We didn’t come to live here! Rather, to go further. We are halfway!’ ‘No, no, we like it here!’ ‘But what about Ra:ma?’ ‘He can stay there [wherever He is now]’ ‘What about Bharatha?’ ‘Bharatha can stay there as well’ ‘What about you?’ ‘We will stay here’. They don’t have a goal! Bharatha was determined to bring back Ra:ma. Due to that, he was able to stay focused on Ra:ma even with all kinds of luxuries around. Bharadwa:ja created an amazing throne for him. The throne is so beautiful, anyone who looks at it is tempted to sit on it. Even if they are not allowed to sit on it, they at least wanted to touch it once and feel content. Bharadwa:ja wanted to test Bharatha and said, “This is for you. This court was created for you. Go ahead and sit on this throne.” Bharatha looked at the throne, circumambulated it, paid obeisances, and then sat on a seat next to it. He started fanning this throne while seated. ‘Who is he fanning? Who is sitting here?’ ‘If a king deserves to be seated on this magnificent throne, then it can only be meant for Ra:ma.’ ‘It is only fit for Ra:ma. So Ra:ma is there.’ ‘Where is Ra:ma? He is not seen here?’ ‘You may not see Him, but I see Him in my heart.’ Since it is Ra:ma’s position, he perceived Him there. He did not partake of anything else. Even while seated there, he imagined himself to be serving Ra:ma. Bharatha did not forget his goal by indulging himself in the food and drinks like everyone else.\nFor a human, his goal must be the primary objective. Only a human can decide on his goal. Hence, it is becoming necessary to teach all of this to human beings. He is therefore called a de:hi (one with a body), de:ha (body) is formed for his sake. “Arjuna, like I mentioned earlier, you need not cry for de:ha, the body… similarly there is no need to cry for de:hi, the soul,” said Sri Krishna in verse 2.30.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nde:hi: nithyam avadhyo:yam\nde:he: sarvasya bha:ratha! |\nthasma:th sarva:ni bhu:tha:ni\n                 na thvam so:chithum arhasi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe soul is eternal and cannot be killed. Therefore, all bodies are temporary, and you should not grieve for them, O Bharatha!\n-----------------------------------------------\nAll bodies are formed to carry out activities. They are formed to perform duties. No matter if it’s Bhi:shma’s, Drona’s, Mine, or even yours, anyone’s for that matter! While carrying out duties, you may like some and dislike some others. Yet duty cannot be ignored! Your duty is to establish dharma (righteousness), and your duty is to decimate adharma (unrighteousness). For you, that is the purpose of this war. You must therefore fight in this war! Do not anticipate its result; instead, focus on how well you are performing your duty. At times you might get hurt and feel like crying. You will have to bear that!” He [Sri Krishna] already mentioned this. … tha:n thithikshasva bha:ratha! Therefore, any body-related issues must be endured, whatever they might be.\n“How can you say, ‘I need to cry for Bhi:shma. I need to cry for Dro:na. Oh my! How can I kill them?’ They are also bodies. There are souls within. Nothing can hurt them. Bodies cannot be stopped [from disintegrating]. Are they [Bhi:shma and Dro:na] the only ones present? It’s a battlefield. Isn’t it? How many more pra:nis (beings) are there? You think, ‘I am not hurting anyone.’ But are you not hurting someone? Why aren’t you crying for those horses, elephants, camels? Will you kill them as you wish? In reality, they all came from this earth. [You say] ‘My body, this body, your bodies, their bodies’... For all, the ma:thruka (birthplace), is the same… and they all go back to their ma:thru bhumi (mother Earth), eventually. You need not cry for them. A lot of people do not know this. We are all born from Mother Earth. We all came out of Her womb. Therefore, we are all called the same. What is that? so:dara:s (those who came out of the same womb), so:dara:s can be men or women - those born can be boys or girls. If they share the same womb, they are called so:daras. If only girls were born, they would be called so:dari:s. Many people unaware of this say ‘so:dara:s and so:dari:mani:s’ [brothers and jewel-like sisters]. Instead of simply addressing men as so:dara:s, thinking they would offend women, they say… ‘so:dara:s and so:dari:mani:s’ and even add manithvam (jewel-like) for women. In fact, that is unnecessary. so:daras encompass everyone. We all are so:daras of mother Earth’s abode. How far does it go? Not just humans, even the animals are our so:daras. Same for birds. Bugs and other little creatures too. In reality, we should be crying for these as well. We should be feeling sad for these too. Why aren’t you crying for them?\nWhat should this be called? Many people talk about ‘vishwa ma:nava soubhra:ththruthvam’ (universal brotherhood of Man). That is not completely right. Does man exist alone in this viswa (universe)? They have destroyed everything because of that [mis]conception. There are many beings. Since we are all so:daras, it should be called as, ‘viswa jani:na soubhra:ththruthvam’ (Universal brotherhood of creatures). Or it can be called ‘vishwa pra:ni soubhra:ththruthvam’ (universal brotherhood of living beings). In reality, compared to humans, other living beings are good. They do their duty and help others as well. Man is the only one who ignores his duty and destroys others. The bad one! Since others are nice, any harm done to them is hurtful. No need to feel sad if man faces any loss because other beings are helpful. However, man ignores others' welfare. He cuts down trees, chops and eats its fruits, kills and eats birds, animals too. He doesn’t think of that as violence. When it comes to a human being, how is that perceived as violence? Is that fair? ‘Should I then not touch the birds and trees and leave them alone?’ It doesn’t mean that. It is not a sin to take what is necessary from them to sustain your life. It is a sin to grab more than what you need from them.\n“Arjuna! Your duty now is to fight such people and stop their crime and their heinous activities.” “No need to cry for them.” ‘Oh no! He is my grandfather! He is my guru, teacher.’ No need to cry. Follow your duty well. In the process, bear anything that comes your way. He already said, tha:n thithikshasva bha:ratha! tolerate such experiences. You do not cry for them [other living beings], but you do for these people [Bhi:shma, Dro:na, etc.]? Like I said earlier, you must not cry for the bodies; you should not cry for the souls either. …sarva:ni bhu:tha:ni na thvam so:chithum arhasi (There is no need to cry for anyone at all). “Fulfill your duty.” Saying this, Sri Krishna is encouraging Arjuna to carry out his responsibility.

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita elaborates on our swaru:pa (innate nature) and the swaru:pa of the world around us. There are many living beings in the world. Is there any connection between us and them? There are many groups of species. What work do we have with them? Human beings want to kill all other species and remain happy. But if anyone harms his loved ones, he cries piteously. In reality, is there a relation between us and the world? Yes. There is.\nWhat do we mean by ‘to us’? It means the conscious indwelling soul who is eligible to be called ‘I’ (or ‘us’). What is visible outside is de:ha (body), a combination of pancha bhu:thas (five elements of Nature). Humans, animals, insects, germs, or stones - all are a combination of pancha bhu:thas. Behind these, there is ji:va (soul), and behind it is God. \n[Everywhere and in everything. Who informed you? Did you see it? No, we didn’t see it. Then how can you discuss what you didn’t see? Because Ve:das (scriptures) showed it. Ve:das apprise us about what to ‘see’ and how to ‘see’. It is wrong to think we can see everything with our eyes. It is also wrong to think our intellect can perceive everything. Our intellect and sight are limited. With the naked eye, we cannot even see microorganisms or the atomic structure which in fact are… when sun rays radiate onto something. Unless there is an instrument which magnifies and shows them, we can’t identify them. How can we identify something subtler than that? A:thma (soul) is the subtlest of all. How can we see it? It is impossible to see.]\nSubtler than that… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nano:rani:ya:n mahatho mahi:ya:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe [God] is smaller than the smallest and larger than the largest.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHow can we see Him? Objects we generally see around us cannot be both [smallest and largest]. If something is small, it is small. If something is large, it is large. The same object being smaller than the smallest and larger than the largest is not even imaginable. Hence Ve:das had to instruct us. However, it’s not visible to our naked eyes. There are certain [instruments] that can see those which are not otherwise visible. Unless there is light, we can’t see any object. Though we have eyes and objects, unless we have light as the means, we can’t see them. Otherwise, we trip on them and fall. We end up troubling ourselves and spoiling other things. Unless there is light, our eyes can’t see. There are few animals like cats that don’t need light to see. They can see clearly even in the dark. Their eyes are made that way. Certain people’s intellects are also like that.\nWhatever we see around us are de:has (bodies), formed from some materials. We are able to see some but can’t see others. We can realize some but can’t know others. We can imagine a few things, but can’t imagine others. Hence we need sa:sthra (scripture) to clarify the swaru:pa of all these. What did God say in the scripture? He said that “Ji:va (soul) is the same in all beings.” However, the bodies outside change with needs. What needs? The need to experience the accumulated karma (records of good and bad deeds) of the indwelling soul. Bodies keep changing because of that.\nFor example, you might have mixed chana (lentil) flour with water, salt, and spices. Some people put potato slices in it and make bajjis (Indian snack). Some people mix some other things and make pakodis (another type of Indian snack). Some other people put it in something else and make hard janthikas (snack). Some other people mix it with other things and give it some other shape. Based on one aspect called taste, its shape and size changes… though the raw material remains the same. Similarly, this Nature, which is made of pancha bhu:thas, keeps taking different shapes based on the need to experience karmas by ji:vas (souls). At some places, it takes human form. In that, sometimes dark or white or medium skin-toned forms. At some places, it takes bird form, dog form, tree form, or stone form. Thus Nature keeps taking different forms because ji:vas need to experience their karma. Accordingly, bodies are formed.\nReminding us of this essence is the intent of all upade:sas (teachings). If we know this, we will know how to use our body… and will know why we obtained this body. We won’t work for the body. Now, we are just focusing on the needs of the body. That also to a limited extent only. We are focusing on what is tasty and enjoyable to the body. We are not paying attention to the needs of the body. Since we want the taste, we don’t mind putting Urea (fertilizer) or other things in it [crops], and eating it. Those [food items] may then lead to cancer or a heart attack. “I am not bothered about what it leads to later. I simply want this satisfaction now. It has to look good. It doesn't matter if it simply increases the quantity [despite lowering the quality]. Repercussions don’t matter.” This is the reason we have so many diseases now. To satisfy the senses and body, different chemicals are used in making foodstuffs… [chemicals] are responsible for changing the food’s composition, making it physically attractive, ultimately wrecking us. Why did we take all this effort? For our taste. To experience our karma. But, for the indwelling a:thma (soul), everything is the same.\nSri Krishna said in Bhagavad Gita verse 5.18,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvidya: vinaya sampanne: brahmane: gavi hasthini |\n                                 suni chaiva svapa:ke: cha panditha:s samadarsinaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFor a knowledgeable person, there is no difference in souls, whether in a learned Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, or a dog eater.\n-----------------------------------------------\nPanditha:ha (knowledgeable one) is one who has jna:na (knowledge). For a jna:ni (one who possesses knowledge), there is no difference in a:thmas (souls). Whether the a:thma [is in a body that] is big, small, medium, short, tall, round, square, or triangle. They see all a:thmas [in different bodies] as the same. We only respect some a:thmas; we are not used to treating others the same way… Which a:thmas do we see? If one thinks, “He is my brother” based on de:ha (body)… he will go out of his way to do things for him. In reality, that’s not how one should be. Bodies are provided to do respective tasks. So you have to use them for those tasks and fulfill your duty.\nIf a panditha, knowledgeable one… vidya: vinaya sampanne: A nice, capable, knowledgeable person is there but he is residing in a body. One calls himself ‘Brahmin’, but he doesn’t have any of his qualities. He doesn’t know ga:yathri mantra (a sacred chant), japa (chanting), or sandhya vandana (daily prayers at sunrise and sunset)… or anything for that matter. He is a complete ignoramus. But based on his physical qualifications, he calls himself a Brahmin. Whether he is a capable or unqualified Brahmin, gavi (cow) or hasthini (elephant), the a:thma is the same in all. Not just in those bodies, but also in suni cha (a dog) as well. svapa:ke cha (and in a person who has degraded into the abominable position of eating dog’s meat)... not in these days, but in those days [it was considered lowly]. Nowadays, if soup is made with dog’s meat, people relish it. Recently, it happened in Seoul. All the Olympic participants were served a special dish, ‘dog soup.’ They are swapa:kas (dog eaters). They make and eat dog’s meat. They are called swapaka:s. It is disgusting. However, it too is a type of de:ha (body). There is a ji:va (soul) behind that body. In the dog, there is a ji:va and De:va (God). Swapaka:s [dog eaters] have ji:va and De:va. Similarly in Brahmin, gavi (cow), hasthini (elephant), these are the bodily changes. In whichever body they are in, there is no difference in the ji:vas.\nsama darshina:ha (the wise see all as equal). The jna:nis recognize all these ji:vas to be the same in eligibility. Sri Krishna didn’t say, “Dog, educated pandit, Brahmin, elephant, cow, dog, dog eater are all equal.” They are not all the same. The ji:vas who are residing in these different bodies are the same. There is no difference in their [souls] a:kruthi (shapes) and swabha:va (innate natures). Based on their karma, these souls got those bodies. We see that based on wealth, one sits in first, others in business, and others in economy [class]. Though filling their stomachs is common for everyone, based on wealth… one may drink rice starch, and others may enjoy feasts in a lavish mansion. Whatever it is, they are related to the body, which is formed based on karma. Keeping the external bodies aside, indwelling souls are all the same.\nSama darshinaha - says Sri Krishna in chapter 5. Arjuna, you don’t have to cry about Bhi:shma or Dro:na. You don’t have to cry for any being. Their bodies will go through change. Even the bodies on your side will change. You are only crying about both of them and other humans but forgetting about animals... You are forgetting about insects and germs. In fact, you should have cried for them as well. However, it is not necessary. While performing duties, when you face happiness or sorrow, you have the responsibility to progress toward your goal, keeping those emotions aside. Your goal is to wage war with the people who came prepared to fight. To contain the miscreants, stopping them from sinning further. As you have the authority and qualification to rule a kingdom, achieve it. Rule it happily. It is unnecessary for you to think about what comes in the way. Sri Krishna is telling Arjuna that sorrow is not good… and is guiding him towards fulfilling his duty, explained in chapter 2.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), It is an arduous task to enlighten one about his duty and guide him towards fulfilling it. Modern society only aims for material pleasures. Enlightening such a society about a:thma (soul), how the human body is a means… what needs to be achieved with the body, and enabling one to achieve it is a difficult task. In fact, unless you understand it… you will not feel that such endeavors are necessary. After you deem it necessary, then you should work for it. While doing it, you may face many hurdles. After a long time, one may achieve the goal. However, he needs to be patient till then. He needs to be determined.\nTo strengthen Arjuna’s determination, Sri Krishna tries to preach to Arjuna in verse 2.30.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nde:hi: nithyam avadhyo:yam de:he: sarvasya bha:ratha! |\nthasma:th sarva:ni bhu:tha:ni na thvam so:chithum arhasi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe soul is eternal and cannot be killed, so you should not grieve for any living being.\n-----------------------------------------------\nNot just for any one body, we need not worry about anyone’s de:ha (body) in this world. This war is a virtuous activity. Fight without hesitation. Why do you think, “Alas! How can I fight and inflict violence on all these people?” We grow crops, right! Once we harvest the crop, we remove the waste and set it on fire. Do we think, “Oh no. How can I burn that which gave us sustenance until this point?” By burning it, the soil becomes clean and serves as fertilizer for the next crop. Sometimes, there are terrible pest infestations. They are also dealt with similarly. If one thinks, “Alas! We are killing pests,” crop loss will occur; the pests will multiply and destroy the entire crop, leaving nothing for humans.\nA swarm of locusts came recently. Our people tried to drive them away. If we think, “Poor beings. We have to harm them,” then your crop will be destroyed. Yours and others' lives will be endangered. Is it wrong to fight and send them back? No, it is appropriate. Is it wrong to gather that waste and cleanse the ground? No! The land becomes clean and rich. We know that this waste would spread bad odor in that region [if left on its own]. The Kau:rava:s (Kauravas), who are directly opposite to you, have become like that waste. I am not asking you to shoot arrows indiscriminately. No one accepts such a person. He would be called a mad person, or a terrorist, and be punished. We see it happen in some places. Someone goes crazy and suddenly shoots at everyone around. He acts without discrimination. There is a responsibility to stop such people. The opposing army is invading the country, crossing borders and occupying territories.\n“If we confront them, they might cry or feel bad,” can we then say, “come conquer us?” Since your duty is to protect the borders there… if anyone crosses the border and claims even half an inch, he must be restrained and sent back. If they don’t retreat, they need to be eliminated. Do we consider this a good or bad deed? Is it dharma (righteousness) or adharma (unrighteousness)? Right now you are responsible for this [waging war]. I am asking you to stop the miscreants, not to kill anyone and everyone. By doing this activity, you will escape hell. They will also escape hell by losing their lives in this. By being a spectator, you will go to hell. By doing the wrong deeds, they also will experience hell. Therefore, both parties can do the right thing of waging war and avoid hell. Thus I am advising you to do it.\nCops catch hold of those who steal. Once caught, those thieves are punished. If authorities feel, “He might cry if I punish him. Why should we apprehend him?” and simply let him go, we know of the negative outcomes. The Supreme Court announced a death sentence for someone who did a terrible crime. The one who executes the death sentence is thala:ri (executioner). If the convicted person is sent to the executioner and the executioner feels, “Oh poor guy, his friends and relatives will cry. His family will fall into trouble. So I won’t do it...” then the executioner himself needs to be reprimanded. The punishment is given to prevent him from sinning further, and to make sure others don't suffer because of him.\nSimilarly, Arjuna! You have this opportunity to wage war... With the war you wage, you will have the opportunity to prevent them from sinning. Since it is your responsibility, you have to do it. In that process, bodies will be in pain; you have to be tolerant. Some bodies might perish. However, that stops them from causing pain to more people, hence, it’s a good thing. If a hand is infected by poison and we leave it be, the poison will gradually spread elsewhere, destroying the body. What should we do? You must amputate the hand through where the affliction is spreading because you have the responsibility to protect the rest of the body. Similarly, this is dharma yuddha (righteous war). You don’t have to contemplate or turn back feeling sorry for anyone. It is your responsibility to wage the war.\nIf a surgeon comes into the operating room and hesitates, claiming, “An incision will hurt the patient,” how can he be called a surgeon? Why would you pay him? If someone takes a knife outside and attacks others without discrimination, that is wrong. If he operates, making an incision where needed, healing the patient… do we consider it wrong? We appreciate him, pay him, and express our gratitude whenever we see him. We nearly treat him like God! Arjuna, today you have the opportunity to wage war for similar reasons. Hence, not just about Bhi:shma (Bhishma) and Dro:na (Drona), as you said earlier…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:cha:rya:ha pitara: putra:ha thathaiva cha pitamaha:ha.\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTeachers, fathers, and grandfathers are all included in this.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna: “By hurting all these [who are like gurus, fathers, grandsons], and hurting myself, I refuse to enjoy whatever is gained from this.” It is wrong of you to say that. You have to contain this sorrow and wage the war. You have to tolerate the joys and sorrows which you may face while waging war. You have to keep aside the sorrow of them perishing.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:th sarva:ni bhu:thani na twam so:chithum arhasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou don’t have to cry for anyone. Do your duty.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWith this, Sri Krishna said in chapter 2 that 3 defects would be acquired if Arjuna refrains from war: ana:rya jushtam (disapproved by the wise), aswargyam (leading to hell), and aki:rthikaram (bringing disgrace).\nAna:rya jushtam - Elders, wise ones, and good people would disapprove. Supporting that, Lord stated so in all these verses through now. If you deny your duty, wise ones will not accept it. They will say whatever you are doing is wrong. The goal of Elders, wise ones, is to guide one towards fulfilling his duties. Their goal is to curb those who are committing crimes. Hence, what you do will be a:rya jushtam (pleasing to wise ones).\nAs we discussed previously, A:ryas (noble people) doesn't mean A:ryas and Dra:vidians. That is an incorrect notion. Whoever stands for what is good or for the welfare of others, regardless from where… let it be Egypt, Iran, Punjab, South India, Sri Lanka or another country… regardless of species, animal or human… the one who stands for dharma (righteousness) is A:rya. The one who transgresses dharma is Ana:rya. A:ryas are impartial and have no hesitation. They will certainly do whatever is required. You should do the same. Since Elders, wise ones, accept it, waging war becomes a:rya jushtam. If you stop and retreat, it becomes ana:rya jushtam. Hence, he described in detail why it becomes a:rya jushtam.\nJna:nis (those with knowledge) understand de:has (bodies) and a:thmas (souls). They know that bodies always perish and souls are eternal. They know that there will be changes in bodies but souls do not change. They know that the body is an instrument and the soul's goal is to attain ultimate bliss. They know that since the body is an instrument at work, it undergoes favorable and unfavorable situations. They know that a:thma is not concerned about them [favorable or unfavorable]. They know how to tolerate impediments in the path. This path is a:rya jushtam, pleasing to and accepted by wise ones. You were born to follow the path of a:rya jushtam. Since you have to do it, wage the war properly. If you do not wage war, they [A:rya:s] will be unhappy.\nSo far, he talked about the first reason, a:rya jushtam. In the beginning of chapter 2, he spoke about two more reasons - aswargyam and aki:rthikaram. To support those reasons, Sri Krishna moves further….\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvadharmam api cha:ve:kshya na vikampithum arhasi |\ndharmya:ddhi: yuddha:th sre:yo::nyath\nkshathriyasya na vidyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nRecognizing your duty, you should not waver; for there is no greater good for a warrior than a righteous war.\n-----------------------------------------------\nChapter 2, verse 31. Sri Krishna says “aswargyam.” What do you think will happen when you don't wage war? Arjuna: If I don’t wage war, then I will be a merciful person. However, since they are not merciful, they will attack me. Even though I may not wage war, they will. Since they are attacking me when I am being a ‘good’ person, they will have committed a crime, and since that is transgressing dharma, they will go to hell.\nSri Krishna: This is what you are thinking, isn’t it? However, no, it’s a wrong thought process! Since you are not waging war to stop the miscreants, you would be the one committing adharma (unrighteous act). They don't become unrighteous when they attack you. Therefore, it is your responsibility to perform svadharma (your duty).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvadharmam api cha ave:kshya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nRecognize your duty\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna vikampithum arhasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou need not be highly affected\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is a dharmya (righteous) war, where dharma is not transgressed. You have an unsolicited opportunity to do the right thing. i.e. without any effort, if we are simply granted an American visa, how happy would we be? If a soldier is given a chance to fight, not stemming from petty quarrels with others… but with enemies who are at fault… and that soldier has an opportunity to save his nation, how enthusiastic would he be? This war is a similar opportunity for you [Arjuna]. Do not hesitate. You have a righteous task at hand. Get ready for war by realizing that the war is rightfully qualifying you [for a higher purpose]. Rise! It will result in you attaining heaven. Stop doing that which results in aswargya (hell), and do that which gives you swarga (blissful heaven).\nSri Krishna thus motivates Arjuna, taking him further. Jai Srimannarayana!\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a venerated scripture among Bharatiyas (Indians). Not just for Bharatiyas, Bhagavad Gita is an esteemed spiritual text for the entire human race. In today's world, Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the greatest scripture respected in all languages by the most number of people. Because it is not a scripture aimed solely at asthikas (theists). In this world, some are theists and others are atheists. Some people could be agnostic.\nThe primary goal of Sri Krishna’s upadesa (teaching), Srimad Bhagavad Gita, is to bestow everyone with teachings that one must know and practice. We can find several such teachings not just in one part but all over the Bhagavad Gita. In those days, there were not many religions. There were some theists, i.e., those who are believers in Vedas. There were some atheists, i.e., those who didn’t believe in Vedas. For those who didn’t believe in Vedas, there were many faiths. Bhagavad Gita provides facts that even they [atheists] need to know.\nIn the second chapter, we recollected verses 2.28, 2.29, 2.30, and 2.31. In these verses, the Lord preaches…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nSanskrit text: a:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEnglish translation: I bow repeatedly to the Lord who is the source of all wealth and who is the remover of all obstacles.\n-----------------------------------------------\nGod explains this fact. Bhagavad Gita is for Arjuna. The upadesa aimed at coaching Arjuna to fulfill his duty as he was disinclined to wage war and was stepping back from recommended dharmic (righteous) acts. We recognize one as a theist if he thinks and believes in duty and dharma in such cases. He [theist] will know what body and soul are. He is conscious of the distinction between body and soul, deh-atma vivekam (distinction between body and soul).\nHowever, we cannot perceive the soul through indriyas (physical senses). We cannot perceive it [soul] through inference either. The only way to comprehend it is through shastras (scriptures). We discussed this several times in the past. Because the soul is not an object that can be perceived by the eye or any other indriya, sense organ. It can only be comprehended through shastra. How can we learn about it? We learn it to be something that cannot be perceivable by the senses. This is how we should comprehend it [soul].\nThere are a few things we comprehend similar to this. If someone asks how high the sky is, and someone else responds by saying that the sky is 100 miles, or 300 miles, or one lakh miles, we will laugh at them. Even if you build some means and travel upwards one lakh miles, it looks the same even from there. The sky is not formed to be a roof. We don’t know how high it is. Nobody does. It is anantham (boundless). Hence, if someone thinks that, “it looks bad if I say I don’t know” and simply provides a random number of miles, then he will be considered a fool.\nIn fact, how do you define “knowing” [in this context]? If someone says its magnitude is beyond comprehension, then that’s correct! He gets 100 marks! Whatever can be comprehended, if someone comprehends as it is, then we can consider him a wise one. Whatever is incomprehensible needs to be acknowledged as being beyond comprehension. That is considered intelligence. If someone claims that they comprehend something which is incomprehensible, then we consider him a fraud.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nSanskrit text: yasya amatham matham thasya matham\nmatham yasya nave:dasaha\navijna:tham vija:natha:m\nvijna:tham avija:natha:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEnglish translation: The one who recognizes that this [soul] is incomprehensible knows it correctly. The one who claims to have comprehended everything about [soul] is mistaken.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhoever recognizes that this [soul] is incomprehensible knows it correctly. Whoever claims that he has comprehended everything about [soul], claiming “besides knowing about the soul myself, let me also provide you with some insights… I will enlighten you with knowledge about the soul… with this shakti patam (act of conferring spiritual energy),” that means he is making a big fool of us. It is because the nature of the object [soul] is like that. It is so minute that you cannot perceive it with your naked eye. There is nothing more infinitesimal than that [soul].\nOur scientists have gone all the way to the anu (molecule) stage. Later they split that into paramanu (atoms). Then, even that was further split and up to 250 particles were discovered within. They are able to reach such a microscopic state! By leveraging the relevant instruments, they are able to identify them [microscopic particles]. However, it [soul] is even more infinitesimal than that [microscopic particle]. Visuddha manasa: grahyaha (pure mind can grasp it). That means, we can believe and identify it with manas (mind).\nHow can we recognize it? It is recognized that it cannot be contained within a boundary and measured. That’s fine! Additionally, to comprehend it [soul], the manas needs to be pure. That means if it [manas] is dirty, then it [soul] is invisible to it [manas]. If the eye has a cataract, then the objects in front of you will be seen as either two or three objects. Or only a part of the object is seen. Or it can go invisible. We call it a defect of the eye, right? Similarly, if at all there are any defects within the manas, because of the karma vasana (instincts from past actions), there is no opportunity for one to recognize (the soul).\nIf he can attain pure manas, free from faults through practice, only that manas will be able to believe in what is stated in shastra (scripture). This is for the soul. There could be some people in the world who do not believe in atma tattva (the reality of the soul) as it is invisible. There may be some people who only work for something which is visible. Whatever is visible is called pratyaksha (perception).\nWe discussed earlier that all indriyas are called aksham (senses). Whatever is in front of each of the indriyas, it is called pratyaksha. Pratyaksha is a very beautiful word. We can use it for three things. Let’s take the example of an eye. The eye, the object that is seen by the eye, and the link between the eye and the object called the ability to see. Only if we have the link, we can comprehend that there is an object. You can call the eye pratyaksha. You can call the visible object pratyaksha. There is a link between the eye and the object, right? The relationship, the knowledge of that relationship can also be called pratyaksha. This is interesting!\nJust to easily understand, we took an example of an eye. This applies to all physical senses. Many people think that it is called pratyaksha only if it is visible to the eye. That’s not true. The ear has the ability to hear. In that case, the ear is called pratyaksha, the sound, which can be heard is called pratyaksha, and the knowledge which recognizes the sound is also called pratyaksha.\nComing to the nose, we call it ghra:na indriya (sense of smell). It smells the fragrance of an object. We recognize the fragrance of a sampangi pushpa (Michelia champaka). The fragrance of the sampangi pushpa is called pratyaksha, the nose is called pratyaksha, and the knowledge attained through the nose [is called pratyaksha]. It is we who perceive the knowledge of fragrance. This is indriya (sense), that is the object, we are getting the knowledge of it. Hence, knowledge is called pratyaksha. The object is called pratyaksha, and even the indriya which is comprehending it is called pratyaksha.\nSimilarly, our skin, tvak indriyam (sense of touch). What is the skin doing? It is touching an object. It is hard, it is soft, it is hot, and it is cold. You can comprehend it, right? The heat, coolness, hardness, and softness are all called pratyaksha. The skin which grasps/feels it is called pratyaksha. The knowledge from the touch is also called pratyaksha. Same for the tongue as well. The tongue eats jaggery. We say wow, so sweet! These days, one may not just like jaggery. Nowadays, items that are made with jaggery are preferred instead of plain jaggery. The object has taste. The tongue needs to sense it [taste] and we need to comprehend it. Since this indriya tastes, it is called rasana indriyam (sense of taste). Even rasana indriya is called pratyaksha. The object which gives the knowledge of taste, such as Gulab Jamun (Indian sweet dishes) or Baadushah or Boondi or Jilebi, or dhoodh peda or burfi or it can be anything else. The object which has a taste is called pratyaksha. When we put that [tasty] object in our mouth, “Ah”, we got that knowledge, right? That is also called pratyaksha. Hence, the word pratyaksha is applicable for three things.\nNow [in the case of the soul], we have indriyas. We have the knowledge, which we attain through indriyas. However, the object [soul] in front of these indriyas is significantly infinitesimal, making it ineligible for being called an object of knowledge. So, it is not possible to observe the soul. So, some people say “We are not going to accept the existence of the soul. We will stop at whatever we can observe [with the indriyas]. We will accept only what we can recognize.” In reality, some people only believe in what they can recognize with physical senses, but they are gullible. They are not just believing in the pratyaksha. Along with pratyaksha, they are believing in oha/anumana (inference) as well.\nWhat is anumana? Based on the knowledge of the physical object in front of us, we recognize the knowledge of something else, right? That’s what it is. The process of gaining knowledge that way is called anumana. Smoke indicates a fire, so we assume/infer that there is one. Based on the fragrance, we infer a flower. Based on the sound, we infer either an object or person or something else. Oha is also called anumana. Some people say they don’t believe in anything else except pratyaksha. They are also innocent. Because they also believe in anumana.\nHe says he is talking to you. He thinks you are there. He believes that you are there. There is the sound that is heard. There is a thought behind the sound. There is a decision that is behind the thought. If he is able to experience all this, he is not just stopping at the recognition of the indriya. Based on this, he is able to go above and beyond (the knowledge of indriya). This means he believes in anumana. Because of anumana, he is getting knowledge. This is called anumiti.\nOut of ignorance, they say, “We are prathyakshavadas (those who only believe in perception), the one who only believes in pratyaksha.” Regardless of what they call themselves, prathyakshavadas or anumanavadas (those who believe in inference), the soul is visible to neither one of them. So, we cannot limit ourselves to that. Shastra gives us knowledge about that [soul]. What it is, how, how much, what does it do, it [shastra] provides all these insights. Based on that, we should recognize the soul. Based on the soul which is [now] recognized, he should do what he is supposed to do.\nThere are people who do not recognize the soul and limit themselves to believing in inference and consider themselves atheists. Even these people have some necessary facts they need to know. Even those are taught by Bhagavad Gita. This is the fascinating part. That’s why Sri Krishna didn’t expound Bhagavad Gita just for one person; it is for anyone in general, who thinks of himself as a human being, regardless of which path he is in or which belief he follows. This is the greatness of Bhagavad Gita. That Bhagavad Gita is for Arjuna, and also for someone who considers himself an atheist. Sri Krishna advises why he [Arjuna] shouldn’t take a step back and shouldn’t feel sad about the war now. Thus, Sri Krishna takes Arjuna forward. Let’s try to understand it clearly. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In the Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna clarifies that the seed for the poisonous tree, samsara (the cycle of life), is of two types. He considered samsara as a poisonous tree and mentioned that it has a seed.\nWhat is samsara? Does samsara mean mother, father, children, wife, husband, relatives, jobs, businesses, wealth, assets, or buildings? No! All these are good. None of them are bad. None of these need to be eliminated. None of these cause any harm to us. Then what is samsara? Samsara is the buddhi (intellect) that makes one incorrectly believe that discrete objects are one and the same.\nWhat is it called? There are distinct things. First is the body. The second is that which prevents the body from becoming a corpse [as long as he is present], stays within it and enables the body to function - talk, think, see, and act - it is known as atma (soul). These two exist here - body and soul. But it does not seem that they are two. We limit ourselves to the body and consider ourselves as this body. “This is me. I am white. I am black. I am brown. I am fat.” I am skinny. I am tall. I am short. I am a man. I am a woman. I am a boy. I am a girl.\nAt the next level, “I am Brahmin, I am Kshatriya, I am Shudra. I am Harijan.” I am Girijan. I am something else, something else… In reality, none of these are ‘I’. If the one who is ‘I’ leaves, none of these exist. Then, all of these get the same samskara (ceremony) upon leaving the body. You see, all the people succumbing to Covid-19 receive the same samskara. Similarly, this body also gets the same samskara. At that time, everyone gets one name. What name? The name with two syllables [in Telugu] - savam (corpse). All of them are equal, whether Brahmins, Harijans, boys, old men, women, wealthy, or beggars. There is no difference. Everyone gets the same name of savam!\nWe are limiting our discussion to humans. In fact, we need to extend our perception beyond humans. There are other living beings who live along with humans. Sri Krishna mentioned this to Arjuna in the past. “Why are you crying that this is my grandfather, my guru, my relatives, my uncles?” Are these the only ones who are dying in the war? Are horses not dying? Are elephants not dying? Are flies not dying? Are mosquitoes not dying? Other living beings are dying, aren’t they? Why are you crying only for them [humans]? Why are you not crying for others? Are these not living beings? Just like they are living beings, these are also living beings, right? He [Sri Krishna] asked [Arjuna] not to cry for either of them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:th sarva:ni bhu:thani nathvam so:chithum arhasi \nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, you should not grieve for any living being.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn reality, these different types of bodies are all made of pancha bhutas (five elements). It is intended for non-believers in the soul, for those who limit themselves to things that are visible. “Even they need not cry when performing their duty, regardless of bringing happiness or sorrow.” He [Sri Krishna] said this. “Why don’t you cry for others? If you cry, you must cry for them all or do not cry at all.” “Do this as your duty!” But there is ignorance in us that does not allow us to work that way. We forget that we are separate from whatever is visible. The qualities of it [body] are different from us [soul]. The purpose of [body] is different from our [soul’s] purpose. We came here [to the body] for a temporary stay. We forget this fact.\nSomeone is sent to a city for work. The city might be an expensive one. The experiences might be luxurious. However, he went there to perform his duty. When his duty is completed there, he needs to carefully return to his place. Let us say his duty is in a temple. In the temple, they are celebrating a festival. He is tasked to shoot [the festivities]. Let us say he works for a TV channel. In that temple, during the festivals, there is wonderful prasadam (sanctified food). There is prasadam in the morning, afternoon, evening, and in the middle. If he says, “This is so great! I want to stay here only!” He will lose his job, right? Temporary pleasures, and temporary sorrow should be ignored. When there are floods, the TV personnel go into the water, into the flow. During the war, they go to the war zone. During terrorist activity, they go into the forests. Nobody knows who is going to do what [to them]. Although that is sorrowful, they endure it and still perform their duty. In the earlier example, the prasadam in the temple brings happiness, which he also accepts and performs his duty. There is no need to be ecstatic for this. There is no need for dejection for that [floods or war]. You should always do this as your duty. When? When we have the sense that this situation is temporary, and our place is elsewhere.\nHowever, when forgotten, danger is inevitable. This is related to the body. The soul also comes to these bodies temporarily, whether that of human or animal, or any other body. We came here only for temporary experiences and it did not manifest as per our wish. We did not desire this. Nothing comes without a reason. No matter what comes, there is a purpose and goal. That means someone gave it to us. We do not know who gave it, or perhaps we have forgotten. As soon as we arrived here, the relationship between us and whoever sent us here was broken. With that, we forgot about him.\nWhen the baby is born from the womb of the mother, the baby cries “qua..qua..” Why does he cry? Our elders jokingly say this. Maybe it’s true, we don’t know... Bhagavatam speaks of this… When the baby is in the mother’s womb, in the 7th or 8th month, the baby has wonderful knowledge of where he came from, how he came, what he did, and what is in this world. Once he crosses the 8th month and enters the 9th month, it [knowledge] gradually fades. Once he is born, because of the influence of this Nature, his knowledge gets blocked. When the connection between him [baby] and the mother is removed, when the umbilical cord is cut, when he starts taking breath independently, when he starts nourishing himself independently, then all the old memories are forgotten. The baby cries, “I had something until now but now I lost it. What is it? Where is it?” It is said that this is the reason behind the cry. In Sanskrit, “qua” means to ask, “What and where is it?” qua gacchasi - “Where are you going?” in Sanskrit. Qua is a beautiful word in Sanskrit. When the baby cries, it sounds like “qua, qua, qua, qua,” right? That means the baby is crying. “I saw something, I heard something, I knew something, I wanted to experience something.” What happened to all that? Where have I come now? This looks like a new location. This looks like a new world. Crying like that, he pursues what he lost. He searches for that.\nOne person looked around him, searching for what he saw inside [the womb]. He started parithaha ikshanam (searching around), hence his name became Parikshit. He was a king. He was the first one who ruled in this Kali Yuga. This ignorance engulfs us as soon as we fall to this earth. The Wise who possess that knowledge gave us grantthas (scriptures), to pull us out of this and make us work accordingly. Scriptures preach what actions you must take to return to your previous state, and how the blockage imposed on you can be cleared. Doing this is known as following the dharma (righteous duty).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndharma pa:lana\nSLOKA MEANING -\nDharma means doing work, doing the work appropriately, knowing the reason why it [body] was given to us.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe do not know why and how this was given. The Wise advise us, “Based on your situation, this is the work you need to do…” This is how and this is how much. Just do it. This is called dharma pa:lana. This is the reason we need to live. We are, however, content once we arrive here. We ignore everything else. What have we become? Bound by temporary happiness, we forget that we and the ‘place we are in [body]’ are different. We have combined both atma (soul) and anathma (body). We are considering the ones which are different and have opposite qualities, as one and the same.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nana:thmani a:thma budhihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhat are we thinking? The body is ‘I’ – We have reached this conclusion.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe did not stop there. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nasve: svamithi ya:mathihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn fact, we own knowledge. We own that great tatva (truth) which possesses profound knowledge.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhatever possesses the supreme knowledge, that is ours. Yet, what happened now is, because of our assumption that this external anathma is us, we assume that everything related to this anathma is ours. When someone who was supposed to be a king goes into a forest, surrounds himself with people from the forest, and marries a girl who is one of them, he thinks that all these people from the forest are his relatives. He wants to stay with them. The baby lion, which is supposed to be in the company of lions, wanders into the crowd of goats and considers the goats to be its relatives, and like them gets frightened and absconds. Similarly, this jiva (soul) assumes everything related to this body as his.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nasve: svamithimathihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBuddhi (intellect) that makes him think of something as his (svam) when it in reality it is not his.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen we sow a seed to grow a tree, the seed splits into two pieces - like a seed of chikku (sapodilla), cluster bean, where the plant emerges from. Our ignorance, our inability to make a distinction between the body and atma, is called deha atma bhranti (confusion between body and soul). This is a poisonous tree. What did it do?\nsamsara (the cycle of life) together, it made us slide along with it. Samsara is the name given to this ignorance. Since this is the one that wrecks us, it is called a poisonous tree.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsamsa:ra vishavrukshasya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFor this samsara poisonous tree, \n-----------------------------------------------\nbi:jam e:thath dvidha:sththitham (this seed is of two types). What are they? anathmanya:thma budhi (assuming that we are something that we are not). Believing what is not ours as ours. This is where all the confusion starts. Bhagavad Gita is meant to release us from this ignorance. Recognize the different objects as separate. Recognize one object as one. If there is an object, recognizing that it is one object, is good knowledge. If there are two objects, you need to recognize that they are separate, not one. Sri Krishna preached Bhagavad Gita, which provided knowledge of the distinction between soul and body… to elevate humans and human society. This is for one and all. Let’s learn how Sri Krishna is teaching Arjuna and move forward. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Sri Krishna started the Bhagavad Gita by urging Arjuna to fulfill his duty that he ought to perform. Prior to that, the Lord described how one would accumulate sin if he neglects his duty, regardless of whether it is easy or difficult. In that context, the Lord recounted three defects resulting from forgoing one’s duty at the beginning of the second chapter. They are:\n1. anāryajushtam (unworthy of respect)\n2. aswargyam (not leading to heaven)\n3. akīrthikaram (bringing disgrace)\nA:ryas (noble ones) are those who are worthy of worship, and jushtam (that which pleases) is something that brings them joy. The wise do not appreciate it if anyone stops performing his duty; they feel bad about it. So Arjuna, what you are about to do will make A:ryas feel sad. Thus, this is anārya jushtam (unworthy of respect).\nHe clarified this nicely in the first part. The second defect is aswargyam. Arjuna, if you feel compassion and think, “Why should I punish or hurt them? Why should I lose my relatives?” and stop the war, you may think you will go to heaven, but instead, you will go to hell. To clarify this, Sri Krishna started explaining it in a few verses. Which verses are they? They are 2.31, 2.32, and part of 2.33.\nVerse 2.31 goes like this…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvadharmam api cha a:ve:kshya: navikampithumarhasi\ndharmya:thi yudha:th sre:yaha anyath kshathriyasya na vidhyathe\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHey Arjuna, everyone has their own duty. Duty (dharma) means the work or activity we do, to say it in simple terms. There are various definitions of duty. Simply put, whatever duty you are meant to do is termed svadharma (one's own duty). If you recognize and understand your svadharma properly, then you don’t have to worry like this unnecessarily.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn the first chapter, Arjuna expressed his feelings, saying, “I have all these symptoms.” What are those symptoms? Arjuna said, “I feel tremors in my body. I have goosebumps. I am sweating. My hands are trembling, and my bow, Gandiva, is slipping from my hand. My body has become hot as if I have a fever.” He stated all of that.\nKrishna replied, “All these are a result of a wrong thought that you brought into your mind. If not for that thought, you wouldn't have had any such symptoms. They weren’t necessary. If you recognize your duty properly, there is no need for you to be affected by anything. You are not one who can be affected.”\nArjuna asked, “Why? Why wouldn’t I be affected? Am I not losing everything? Am I not losing all relatives whom I love? What will I be left with? Whoever I want to enjoy my royal pleasures with, I will be losing all of them. I will be left alone. For whose sake are these riches and for whose enjoyment?”\nKrishna responded, “This is what you are thinking - but remember one thing. You are a Kshatriya, which means you have the capability to rule now. You did not provoke anyone or incite them to war. Our neighboring countries sometimes provoke us into war. Arjuna didn’t do anything like that. You didn’t come here to settle some petty scores. This war is dharmya (righteous), in which dharma (righteousness) is not transgressed. You did not harass them or invoke war. They purposely committed many sinful activities and brought this war upon themselves. You are fortunate. This is a good war. It is a dharmya war where dharma is not transgressed. You cannot get an opportunity to participate in such a war with just a few or small puṇyas (results of virtuous activities). You can only get this opportunity if you have done a huge puṇya! Of many people with such puṇya, only a selected few would receive such a wonderful opportunity. You got that good fortune though you did not desire it.”\nKrishna continued, “Suppose someone somewhere bought a lottery ticket and had to leave town for some reason. As he had already bought the ticket, he gave it to you, thinking that he wouldn’t win. Assume by some fortune, your lottery ticket is the winner of a 500 crore prize. It’s okay; we can think like that as there is nothing wrong in wishing for good things. How happy should you feel? You did not cheat anyone or beg from anyone or make someone lose it or wrongfully take it from someone. As you had God’s grace, it came to you gradually by some means. Similarly, Arjuna got this wonderful opportunity to wage war and punish the offenders and stop the sinful activities of the opponents. This is a dharmya war where dharma is not transgressed. If nyāya (justice) is not transgressed, it is nyāyyam (justified). Similarly, if it doesn’t transgress dharma, it is dharmyam (righteous). For the capable ones, whatever war is about to take place now is a righteous war. What better opportunity can there be than this?”\nHence, Sri Krishna tells Arjuna that he need not worry. There are two important aspects which we need to take note of:\n1. Svadharma (one's own duty)\n2. Kshatriyas (warriors)\nWe need to learn about these two. What does it mean to be a Kshatriya? People are classified into Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. Kshatriyas are those customarily thought of as ranked second. We need not accept only this classification of Kshatriya. Alternatively, we can look at this another way. Kshathath thrayate iti kshatriyaḥ (one who protects others from loss or trouble is called a Kshatriya). If anyone in his jurisdiction has kshathi (loss or trouble) and one has the ability to relieve that person of kshathi, that one can be called Kshatriya. What is he doing? If others have kshatha (injury or difficulty), he is thrayate (protecting) them. He can’t be called Kshatriya simply by birth in that caste. We can also say that, but Sri Krishna is not saying it with that intention in this context. \n“Arjuna, you are born as a Kshatriya. You are born with the authority to stop other people's offenses. Hence, that is your first priority. What better opportunity than this can you get to do that [punish offenders]? Sri Krishna tells Arjuna that this is good for him. There is nothing that can be better than this.”\nThe Lord also mentions another word. svadharmam api cha a:ve:kshya: (considering one's own duty). What is sva? What is dharma? Sva means ‘one’s own.’ Dharma means the work or activity which you should do. When you say that we should know what we should do, we should also know what we are prohibited from doing. We should know what we shouldn’t be doing. What should we do? We should properly do the activity which we should do. We should recognize the obstacles to that activity and remove them. We should see who can assist us with this and take their help. That is our responsibility. \nIf one is performing his dharma, it is also his responsibility to keep away others who are obstructing it. Suppose I have to dry an object to be used for some purpose. It is important to allow the sunlight to reach it without any obstruction. It is equally important to make sure to protect it from animals who may spoil it or eat it. This applies to those who want to achieve something out of that activity. Similarly, for the one who wants to achieve something out of this life, he should know what activity is to be done, that is dharma. He should also know what he is not supposed to do, that is also dharma. We should learn the extent and how it’s to be done. Dharma is work or activity. We should also know about those who are favorable, unfavorable, or passive towards that activity. We should keep those close who are favorable to us and keep away those who are unfavorable, and can set aside those who are passive. This is dharma.\nThen what does svam mean? Svam means ‘one’s own.’ Only if you understand svam, will you understand svadharma. There are many levels to the word ‘svam.’ At first, svam is only the body. If you think the body alone is svam, then svadharma is to make sure the body is in proper condition. What does it mean to keep it in proper condition? When to eat? How much to eat? How to eat? How to be so that the body can give us all kinds of happiness? That means you know one level of sva, which is the physical body level.\nFor someone with family, sva is family and relatives. Then their sorrows and pleasures become this person’s sorrows and pleasures. If one thinks of sva as his body only, then he is only concerned that his hands, feet, eyes, ears, and other body parts are good and doesn’t care about the person next to him as his svam is confined to the body. However, if svam expands to family, then he will be generous enough to think about his family members' pleasures and pains as his own. This is one step higher. \nEven one more step higher, whatever is separate from this visible body - ātma (soul) or manas (mind) or buddhi (intellect) - we think of that as svam. Whatever you think of as svam, you should recognize it, protect it, and remove what comes in the way. If you know that, then it is svadharma. If you implement it accordingly, it is svadharma acharana (practice of one's own duty). It is essential for us to get clarity on svam. Let’s try to do that gradually. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), very often, we hear the words ‘dharma’ and ‘svadharma’. Even those who don’t know the meaning of ‘svadharma’ use these words frequently. Those who don’t know what ‘svam’ (self) or ‘dharma’ (duty) is, also use them. It feels as if we understand them, but we actually don’t have clarity.\nIn chapter 2, Sri Krishna gave an upade:sa (teaching) to Arjuna. He thought it essential to give clarity on these words. In verse 2.31, Sri Krishna says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvadharmam api cha:ve:kshya na vikampithum arhasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf you know your svadharma (own duty) properly, you wouldn’t cry like this unnecessarily.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna grieved prior to this, saying...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naho: batha! mahathpa:pam karthum vyavasitha: vayam |\nyad ra:jyasukha lo:bhe:na hanthum swajanam udyatha:ha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAlas! We are committing a huge sin by waging war and killing these people.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna tells Sri Krishna that He is also committing a huge sin. Arjuna is not saying that he is committing a sin alone, but includes Sri Krishna by saying ‘we’. Vayam vyavasithaha (we are ready to do it) - why? Yath ra:jya sukha lo:bena (out of greed to attain riches and kingdom). Thus, Arjuna expressed his grief.\nSri Krishna says that it is wrong to cry for that. Why? Is it proper for one to cry while he is executing his svadharma (own duty)? For a surgeon, let’s say ‘operating’ is his svadharma. If necessary, even if it is his wife, he needs to make an incision. He needs to do it whether it is brother, father, or anyone else. He is a surgeon and needs to operate, regardless of who the patient is. It is only dangerous when he does so without knowing what he is doing. As long as he knows what he is doing, then it’s okay.\nHowever, if he says he doesn’t want to make an incision at all, is that proper? One has to perform his duty regardless of liking it or it being difficult. An executioner is an employed individual who implements the death sentence. What should he do? If someone is sentenced to death and sent to him, he should happily implement that punishment. This is not sinful; it is his job. It becomes part of his official duty. It becomes his svadharma (own duty). Even if inflicting pain, it’s not considered violence or sinful. No one claims he will go to hell for that. Instead, they say he will attain heaven (swarga) for fulfilling his responsibility properly.\nHave you ever heard of yamabhatas (Yama's assistants), Lord of death Yama’s assistants? What do they do? When the time comes, they probably refer to something like a spreadsheet or maybe they refer to all the data [regarding a soul’s sinful deeds] in a smartphone. They have all the info about the whereabouts of the soul they are assigned to retrieve. Even if the soul refuses to comply, with the body on life support, from a doctor forcibly sustaining the heart or lungs, those yamadhuthas (Yama's messengers) forcibly snatch the soul [from the body, and placing it into a new suitable body for punishment] and hit him with thorny sticks, unleashing violent dogs on him. He [the soul] will be crying in a pitiful state. It doesn’t stop there. Once he is in hell, if he continues crying out loud, he will continue to be tortured, even by boiling him in hot oil. \nWon’t he die? No. That realm is designed so that the soul is forced to experience the result of his karma (deeds). He is given a body suitable to experience his karma. That body will be frying in boiling oil but won’t get burned or turn into ashes. He won’t die. The indwelling soul will be experiencing the body’s pain of burning. As the body given is made for the purpose of experiencing pain, he will be experiencing it and nothing happens to the body. Let’s say, unable to bear the pain, he tries to jump out of the pan with boiling oil. Do you know what the yamadhuthas do then? They catch hold of him, pierce him with a spear, and put him back in the pan again. Isn’t it a sin to harass them, make them cry and trouble them like that? No! It is their duty.\nThis is to emphasize that whatever one’s duty may be, one should follow it. It doesn’t mean one should pierce or fry someone! Whatever is one’s prescribed duty, if he hesitates in performing it, then he is pa:pi:ya:n bhavathi (becomes a sinner). The one negligent is the one who commits a mistake, not the one who performed his duty properly. Arjuna was unsure if he would become a sinner by hurting his enemies. Poor Arjuna grieved thinking that way.\n“No, the war which you are waging is dharmya (righteous), a righteous one.” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndharmya:ddhi: yuddha:th sre:yo::nyath kshathriyasya na vidyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFor someone like you, what more can you be bestowed with than such a dha:rmic (righteous), war?\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou should be happy. This great opportunity came to you by itself, unasked for. You got this opportunity to wage a righteous war, to punish wrongdoers, preventing them from sinning further. You got an opportunity to nullify the crimes which they did in the past. This is not something that one gets easily. So there is no need to contemplate - simply fight. In fact, only those people who follow dharma with this mindset attain swarga (heaven). Those who don’t go to hell (naraka).\nWe need to know what heaven and hell are. We might have some idea. Heavenly damsels like Rambha and readily available intoxicants are abundant there. Anyone can enjoy as many types of drinks, and as much as they like. That is heaven. Naraka (hell) is what we discussed before. It is a place where you are put into boiling water, pierced with spears, and cut into slices. Actually, these are not what heaven and hell are. Swarga (heaven) is what gives us sukha (pleasure). Naraka (hell) is what gives us dhukha (pain). \nWhat are sukha and dhukha? Punya (result of good deeds) is sukha (pleasure) and pa:pa (result of sinful deeds) is dhukha (pain). Yet, what actually is sukha? Whatever gives us a favorable feeling is sukha. It is given by punya. If you attain it [sukha], that is swarga. Whatever gives us an unfavorable feeling, ananuku:lathaya: ve:dani:yam (that which makes you feel “I don’t like this. This is causing me trouble”), that experience is called dhukha. Whatever causes it is called pa:pa. Whatever the resulting experience is called naraka.\nSwarga and naraka are not the same for everyone. They are different for each person. For a drunkard, a constant supply of liquor is swarga for him. He will be in his own world sitting in his garden, downing one bottle after another. He is not concerned about the outside world. For him, that is swarga, as he is experiencing something favorable there. For another person, it could be something else.\nMother Sita asked Rama one day, “Rama, do you know what swarga and naraka are?” Rama: “Why are you asking me this? I am also educated.” Sita: “Then tell me what they are.” Rama: “Swarga has de:vathas (heavenly beings), heavenly beings in a grand kingdom. Indra, king of de:vathas, will be there etc.” This is like ‘education during the rainy season’ where schools were not open regularly and education suffered. Or it is like ‘corona education.’ No need to write exams. No need for books or teachers. It is called ‘online education’ but children aren't sure what they are learning. \nSita: “Rama, your knowledge is also like that.” Previously they used to refer to it as ‘education during the rainy season’. Now we can slightly reword it and term it ‘corona education’. This reminds us of a funny story. There were two engineers. They also did ‘online engineering’. Their teacher gave them an assignment. The teacher asked them to measure the height of a big pole and then left them on their own. They were perplexed, as there was no ladder to climb the pole to measure it nor could they fly. \nThere was a woman who worked in the fields, passing that way. She saw these two lads and understood they were in trouble and were disturbed. She asked, “What is the problem?” Engineers: “Our teacher asked us to measure the height of this pole.” But we don’t have a ladder or anything. We don’t know what to do.” Woman: “Is that all?” Engineers: “Why do you say that?” Woman: “You have that bag with you. Please take out what’s inside.” They took out a few wrenches. Woman: “Give me a wrench.” The woman loosened the nuts and bolts of the pole and laid it on the ground. There was also a measuring tape in that bag. Since they were sent to measure it, they were given the instruments to do so as well. The woman took the tape and measured the pole. Woman: “It is 27.5 feet.” She left after that. \nThe second engineer said, “How foolish is this lady… our teacher wanted the height of this pole, but this lady gave us the length of the pole instead!” She [our teacher] wanted us to find out the vertical length of the pole, but she measured the horizontal. They are ‘online engineers’ with ‘corona education.’ Sri Rama’s education was similar. Sita: “[Your interpretation] is not the definition of swarga or naraka. Whatever gives you a favorable experience, that is swarga.” “Whatever gives an unfavorable experience, that is naraka.” \nRama: “So what now?” Rama still didn’t understand. Sita: “yasthvaya: saha sas swargaha nirayo: yasthvaya: vina: (Wherever you are with me is heaven; wherever you are away from me is hell). Dear Rama, swarga and naraka are not the same to everyone. They vary for each person; they are vayyakthikas (individual). For me, staying with you is swarga. Living away from you is naraka. It could be a village, forest, or a deep jungle. If I am with you, wherever it is, even if in a grove, it is swarga for me. You are asking me not to come with you, but instead enjoy comforts and royal pleasures. However, without you, all these will feel like naraka for me. There is no other naraka for me than this. It is your responsibility to properly know the definition of swarga and naraka.”\nThus, mother Sita explained swarga and naraka. Sri Krishna is explaining the same to Arjuna now in Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2. “What you are about to do, retreating from war, you think it will result in heaven… but it only gives dukha (pain). Instead, if you do your duty properly… though it may give momentary pain, it ultimately results in swarga (happiness). That is why this yuddha (war) is dharmya (righteous), where dharma is not transgressed.”\nIn 2.31, Lord says \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndharmya:ddhi: yuddha:th sre:yo::nyath kshathriyasya na vidhyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFor someone like you, what more can you be bestowed with than such a dha:rmic (righteous), war?\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere can be no better sre:yas (good) for you than this. Inspiring Arjuna for war in such a way, Sri Krishna is taking the upa:desa (teaching) further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In chapter 2, verse 31 of Bhagavad Gita, while stressing the importance of responsibility to Arjuna, Sri Krishna explained the significance of performing svadharma (one's own duty). That is called dharmyam (righteousness).\nThe Lord says,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvadharmam api cha:ve:kshya navikampithum arhasi\ndharmya:ddhii yudha:th sre:yo:nyath kshathriyasya na vidhyathe\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou should consider your own duty and not waver; for a warrior, there is nothing more honorable than a righteous war.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe should always do our svadharma. We have discussed this in the past. What is svadharma? We should understand carefully what ‘svam’ means. Svam means ‘I’. Svam gets a deeper meaning as our knowledge improves in the proper way. At one level, svam applies only to the body. At another level, svam relates to one’s occupational duty. If he is a ruler, that activity of ‘ruling’ involves svam. Whatever he needs to do then, becomes his svadharma.\nAll these levels of svam seem to pertain to the body. However, the word svam does not actually pertain to the body. It refers to a:thma (soul), the body’s indweller. Only if the indweller is there, can he utter the word ‘svam’. If he is not present, the body doesn’t respond when cut or burned or thrown away. Hence, the word ‘svam’ pertains to a:thma (soul). Whatever we need to do when a:thma comes into the body is svadharma.\nSri Krishna wants us to realize this. We didn’t get bodies because we desired them. Someone gave them to us. He must have given it to us for some purpose. If we don’t know the purpose, we should find out from someone wise. Then, we should act accordingly. That’s why our people speak about dharma:charana (following dharma), in three ways. Why should we do dharma:charana? You should do it to know the purpose you came here for. Since that is the purpose He gave us the body, we should work towards attaining it.\nIf you don’t know it, the wise might have defined it before. There is no need for us to discover something new today. We do not have enough knowledge or time to discover something new. As certain people have already traveled this path, it’s advisable to follow the path of the wise. Hence, there is an injunction that we should perform our svadharma.\nWhile performing svadharma, we shouldn’t expect any specific result - as it is our duty. For example, a clerk is appointed in the office for the purpose of signing certain documents. If someone gets ‘ideas’ that his duty is to verify them… If they are in proper order, he should sanction them, stamp them, and return them. That is his job. If he does his job properly, at the end of the month he will naturally get his salary.\nIn spite of taking his salary, if he takes bribes for signing or attesting with a stamp... or raises unnecessary queries for the sake of bribes, that is not good. When he is doing his assigned duty, he shouldn’t expect temporary or special rewards for his work. Realizing one’s duty, performing his work without expectation is ‘dharma’ or ‘svadharma’. As a clerk, he should do clerical work and not expect anything. As an officer, he should do that work without any expectation.\nIt is nice to talk about this ideal way, but whether this is true in practice or not… let’s leave it to one’s own introspection. How to correct it as well - let’s leave it to them. If you do your dharma without expectation, it will yield a great reward for you. Otherwise, it will put you back in this cycle (of birth and death). This is what Sri Krishna said.\nEach of us was given a body. With it, one has to accomplish a few tasks. Let’s know what they are and do them. Sri Krishna: “Arjuna, you got this body to wage war and to remove the troubles of others. At least to alleviate the troubles of those who are dependent on you, you should do your duty. Or you should do it for those who are opposing you, to stop them from degrading themselves further… and give them sadgathi (a better state of existence). That is your duty. That is why Sri Krishna called this war ‘dharmya’ (righteous).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndharmya:ddhi: yuddha:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis war is righteous because it does not transgress dharma.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHence, do it. In this manner, Sri Krishna motivates Arjuna for war. Sri Krishna: “For this, you shouldn’t feel vikampam (trembling hesitation).”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nahobatha mahath pa:pam\nkarthum vyavasithamayam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOh, what a great sin it would be to engage in this!\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou shouldn’t talk like that [as if it's a huge sin to kill them]. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvepadhushcha sari:reme si:dhanthi mama ga:thra:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI am losing control of my body parts.\n-----------------------------------------------\n‘You need not talk like this. Do your duty properly. If we take a step further, Sri Krishna clarifies this in another way in verse 2.32.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyadruchchaya: cha upapannam\nswarga dwa:ram apa:vrutham\nsukhinaha kshathriya:h pa:rttha\nlabhanthe: yuddham i:drusham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is not an opportunity which everyone gets; only the happy kshatriyas (warriors) attain such a war.\n-----------------------------------------------\n“This war is happening because of yadruchchikam (opportunity). We have to remember this word yadruchchikam. “If you fulfill this duty which came through yadruchchikam… it is very easy for you to enter swarga (heaven). With this, you can easily attain swarga without any obstacles. That is why not everyone gets this opportunity. Only those who are worthy and good get this opportunity.”\nThe Lord used two words here, ‘yadruchcha’ and ‘swarga’. Just as we learned about svadharma, we need to learn these two words as well. Many people use these words, ‘svadharma’ and ‘paradharma’ (others' duties). Let’s ignore whether they talk about them knowingly or unknowingly... it is good for all of us to understand these words.\nSvadharma is the activity we must do recognizing the position we are in. Paradharma is the activity that is not right for us. A small example... We must have read this story in our childhood about a dog and a donkey. The dog was protecting the washerman's house while the donkey was carrying his clothes. Once a thief came into his house. The dog did not bark. But the donkey, out of good heart, brayed. We have heard the story. The poor washerman woke up, scolded the donkey for disturbing his sleep, and beat it black and blue.\nParadharma - forgetting one’s duty, following others’ duty which is unwarranted… and doing unwanted activities. If one recognizes one’s own duty and does it, that is svadharma. Generally, our people talk about religions when they talk about svadharma and paradharma. Religions are not svadharma and paradharma at all. These words refer to ‘activities.’\nLet’s say one person has the responsibility of boiling milk. And another person has the responsibility of sealing the bottles. Each person has to do his duty. They need not perform another’s tasks when their own duties are separately assigned. Similarly, as long as we are in the body, we have to do duties pertaining to the body. If we understand who gave us this body and for what purpose, and then do the activity, it becomes svadharma.\nForgetting this, if one says “I will not do any physical responsibilities… I will attain a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul), and stay engaged in dhya:nam (meditation)” That means, whilst in the body, he is trying to follow [only] the dharma of a:thma (soul), reality distinct from the body. If you try to follow a:thma dharma after leaving the karmic body, that is ‘fine’. However, if you try to follow [only] a:thma dharma in this body, that is not recommended.\nIf you are sitting in the car, you shouldn’t walk because the wheels are doing their job. If he is sitting in the car and feels “No, I want to run”… and opens the top of the car, gets out, and starts running, he will lose his life. That is paradharma. When sitting in the car, you should behave accordingly. While in the body, if you do activities recognizing the purpose for which it is given, that is svadharma.\nKarthavya pa:lana (performing your duty) is svadharma. Karthavya vismarana (forgetting your duty) is paradharma. For Arjuna, waging war is svadharma, his duty. Begging for alms is paradharma. “Arjuna, know your svadharma and work accordingly. This came out of yadruchha.”\nReferring to yadruchchikam, generally people think it came out of its own accord. No! Someone gave Arjuna this opportunity. Who gave it? Yadruchchaya - whatever comes out of the iccha (desire) of someone named yath is yadruchchikam. Who is that yath? In Vishnu Sahasranama (a sacred text), and other puranas (ancient texts) and itihasas (epic histories), yath refers to Bhagavan (the Lord).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:ko naika sava kah kim yath thath padam anutthamam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe is the one who protects those who take shelter in Him.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAll these are His names in Vishnu Sahasranama. Yath is also one of His names. What does it mean? Whoever always strives to protect those who take his shelter - that person is yath. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyathathe: ithi yath\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe strives to protect His devotees.\n-----------------------------------------------\nFor what is He yathathe, striving? To protect his devotees. Gajendra (the elephant) was in trouble. The Lord came running from somewhere and protected him. Draupadi (the princess) was in trouble. The Lord protected her. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naham smara:mi madhbhaktham naya:mi parama:m gathi:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI always remember my devotees and guide them to the ultimate goal.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe always remembers the one who takes His shelter even once. The purana tells us that He never forgets those who take His shelter. Aham smara:mi (I remember). Even if we forget Him, He will hold us without forgetting. His name is Yath. His sankalpa (intention) is yadruchcha.\nSri Krishna says, “For you… this war happened with the Lord’s sankalpa, intention. Nothing happens in this world on its own or by coincidence. Whatever happens, happens with someone’s sankalpa. If some activity is occurring in a structured way, someone is executing it behind the scenes. Whatever it is, whether small or big. This [war] was also ‘organized’ by someone. Since this war is happening by the sankalpa of the one whose name is Yath… you do not have the right to say that you don’t want to wage this war.\nThe Lord is the one who is within you and directing you... He is also within all these people and directing them... so you have to behave according to His sankalpa, there is no other way. This is something which you ought to do. Fortunately, you got this opportunity, so just do it. In this way, Sri Krishna encourages Arjuna for the Bharata Sangramam (the war of the Bharatas).\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna utters verse 2.32 as the second reason encouraging Arjuna [to wage war]. \nArjuna, if you stop waging war, you are thinking you might go to heaven - aswargyam (not worthy of heaven). \nana:rya jushtam aswargyam aki:rthikaram arjuna (It is unworthy, not worthy of heaven, and brings disgrace, Arjuna). \nHe said in the beginning of the second chapter itself that if Arjuna doesn’t wage war, he will incur three sins/defects. Sri Krishna started describing how Arjuna will incur the second sin and asked him not to do it. \nWhat did he say? \nyadhruchcha:ya cha upapannam (This war is a result of divine will). \nThis ya:druchchikam (divine will) does not mean out of coincidence. Lord is establishing that it is a result of His sankalpa (divine will). \nWho is the cause for the war? It is because of Sri Krishna. Sri Krishna went as a messenger when the Pandavas sent him, right? Yes. Didn’t He go to stop the war from happening? Yes. Didn’t everyone prepare for war because Kauravas acted terribly and didn't listen to Him? No!! \nHow come? That’s how it is! How did it happen? This is how it happened. Actually, if Pandavas pleaded with him, Duryodhana, who was behaving as if he was the Kaurava King, would have given whatever they asked for. He would have been happy thinking that such great people came and pleaded with him. That was his personality. \nPoor Pandavas also got ready to do the same. Pandavas did not revolt against Kauravas for the various troubles they inflicted on them. They were adjusting themselves to those troubles just like a battered snake, which sways to the opposite side when hit from the other side. Pandavas did not display any kind of resistance to Kauravas for anything. \nHowever, that day when Draupadi was insulted in front of the whole assembly, when Duryodhana showed his thigh to Draupadi asking her to sit on his lap after his brother dragged her by her hair, unable to bear it, Bhima took two pledges. \nFirst: [Bhima] “That thigh where you asked [Draupadi] to sit, I will break that thigh.” \nSecond: [Bhima] “Whoever brought her by dragging her hair, I will pierce his chest, and apply [that blood] to [her] hair and put it in a bun.” \nBhima took these two pledges. They had to be fulfilled. Since he took the oaths, they should be fulfilled. To do so, war should take place. Yet, these Pandavas are not in the state of mind to wage war. They lived in forests for 12 years and one year incognito. They emerged afterward and sent peace messages. \n[The Pandavas] “Please provide us with five villages like Indraprastha, Vrukaprastha.” Or four villages and any other place you wish. If you do not wish to provide five villages then at least provide five colonies. If you do not wish to provide that either, then provide five streets. If not them, then provide five buildings. If not that, then at least provide us with a five-bedroom house.” \nThat’s how much Pandavas degraded. They came to a pitiable stage of saying even five beds in a house are enough for us. When Sri Krishna was going for the negotiations, he asked Pandavas what should be conveyed. They all sent peace messages. In the end, He came to Draupadi. \nHe asked, “Sister, what is your message?” Holding back tears in her eyes and showing her hair, she asked, “Brother, will this hair become eligible to be tied up properly or not? All of these [Pandavas] seem to be dimwits. They are all inclined toward peace. If they do that, how can the chest of that person be cut open? How will the thigh of that person break who asked me to sit on it? This [peace talk] is not enough for that to happen. \nSee, each one of the Pandavas is capable of ruling a country. Yet, all five are sitting like morons and sending You with peace messages. You are capable of doing anything. Are you going to bring back a peace message like these people are requesting? “Won’t this hair have the eligibility to be tied properly?” \nPatting her shoulder, Sri Krishna said, “That’s why I am going.” What does it mean? “I am going so your hair can be properly tied once again, I am going to fulfill your pledge.” Does it mean he is going to make peace between both of them? No! “If anyone else goes they may succeed in making peace with the Kauravas.” \n“That [peace] should not happen, war should happen.” “That is the reason I am going, so the wrongdoers are eliminated.” Sri Krishna told Draupadi, “Sister, I promised that you should be able to properly tie your hair.” “I will do anything to fulfill that promise.” \nLet any false allegations come my way. I don’t care. To fulfill your word, one who has taken shelter of Me and surrendered upon to Me, that is My goal. \nAnilji - please combine into proper format | dhyo: pathe:th pruthvi si:rye:th himava:n va: sakali:bhaveth \nAnilji - please combine into proper format | thushye:th tho:ya nidhihi krushne: na me: mo:gham vacho:bhave:th \n“I always keep my word.” Let the sky break and fall… Let the Earth collapse into itself… Let Hima:van (Himalayas), personified Himalayas, who are everlasting, might break into pieces… Let the ocean, which is always moving with its waves, dry up without a drop. However, the promise I made to you will never be futile.” \nThus giving confidence to Draupadi, Sri Krishna left. What did He go to do? Did He go to make peace? Someone who didn’t know said, “Sri Krishna made many efforts. All those efforts made by that great one went in vain.” “And the preparations for the war began.” \nIn fact, Sri Krishna didn’t go to make peace; He also behaved accordingly. When everyone [Kauravas] stood at their doorsteps to welcome the Lord with kalasas (water-filled pots), the Lord proceeded straight forward to Vidura’s house, as if He didn’t notice them, to Vidura’s house, and ate the banana peels which Vidura offered Him. \nAfter arriving, Duryodhana asked Him, “We were standing outside our houses with kalasas. Couldn’t You see us? They call you pundari:ka:ksha (one with big eyes)? You passed all our houses and went.” Where did you go? Why did you go?” \nSri Krishna: “I went to Vidura’s house.” Duryodhana: “What did you do at Vidura’s house?” Sri Krishna: “He offered me food, I ate and came.” Duryodhana: “But we made arrangements for You.” Sri Krishna: “I shouldn’t eat at your house.” \nDuryodhana: “Why?” Sri Krishna: “Because you are my enemies.” Duryodhana: “How can we be your enemies?” Sri Krishna: “Because you hate Pandavas.” \nPa:ndava:n dvishase ra:ja:n (You hate the Pandavas, O King). Duryodhana: “We are brothers; we will have issues regarding property.” Sri Krishna: “Who do you think Pandavas are? They are my five pra:na:s (life forces). Does it make sense if you say that you love me but hate my pra:na (life force)? How can you consider me and my pra:na as separate? Hence, if you hate Pandavas, that means you hate my pra:na and thus, you hate me.” \nIf he talks like that, will he be able to make peace? Duryodhana is full of arrogance; if you speak a few good words to him, he would be won over. Sri Krishna: “The food at your house lacks ruchi (taste) and suchi (cleanliness).” \n“The food at Vidura’s house has ruchi and suchi; hence I went there.” Isn’t this taunting to Duryodhana? He insulted Duryodhana like this. Duryodhana was angered. Duryodhana: “Why do you say our food lacks ruchi, taste, or suchi, cleanliness?” \nSri Krishna: “No, I am not concerned with external ruchi, suchi. I need the ruchi of prema (love). There is no love in you, only arrogance. I am not looking for suchi, external cleanliness. It [food] should not be polluted with dushta pravrutthi (wicked behavior). Vidura doesn’t have this; hence I ate what he offered. “They may just be peels, but they were very tasty.” \nSri Krishna said, “You don’t have them [ruchi, suchi].” How can peace be achieved then? Sri Krishna didn’t go to make peace; he went to ensure [the same atrocities] didn’t reoccur. Hence, He clearly told what He had to say in the assembly. \nDuryodhana got angry and said that he wouldn’t even give enough land to place a needle. Actually, he doesn’t have the authority to say that. Dhritarashtra should say that as he is the king. Duryodhana thus spoke unofficially, assuming the entire responsibility for himself. \nSri Krishna agreed, “fine,” and went on his way as that's what was needed. Preparing them for war was what was needed. Sri Krishna was the one who did that. In the assembly, Sri Krishna showed his Vira:t Ru:pa (universal form), containing the entire universe. \nHe showed this to the dushta chathustaya (wicked four), who came to capture Him. We have heard all about this story in Mahabharata and seen it too. Sri Krishna wanted the war to happen. \nWhat will happen? Kauravas, who have an 11 akshou:hini (formation of millions of men, horses, elephants) army, who have grown like a pile of vines, need to be destroyed. All the waste needs to be burnt. Pandavas need to be saved. This, Lord has decided. \nSo, with whose will did the war happen? With Sri Krishna’s will. Who is Sri Krishna? \nE:sha Na:ra:yanaha Srima:n kshi:ra:rnava nike:thanaha (This is Narayana, the Lord who reclines in the milky ocean). \nna:ga paryankam uthsrujjyahi a:gathaha madhura:mpurim (Leaving the Na:ga Paryanka, bed of A:di Se:sha, He came to the city of Madhura and took birth in jail as if desiring to be there). \nHe was born to Devaki and Vasudeva. Later he grew up with Yashoda and Nandago:pa. The same Sri Krishna is here now. Bhishma declared this about Sri Krishna. Hence, He is Sri:manna:ra:yana himself, Sri:ya pathi (Lord of wealth). \nHis name is Yath. War took place by the will of Yath, the Lord. Hence it is Ya:drucha (divine will). The Lord is clarifying this in verse 2.32. \nyadruchchaya: cha upapannam (Since this is happening with God’s will, you should definitely do it). \nYou do not have the authority to say you will do this much only, this way, not do that much, etc. You cannot escape from this. Let’s say someone is employed in an office setting; a residence and car are also provided. Some working hours are assigned, and some servants are provided. \nIf a particular task is assigned to him, how can he refuse? If he denies doing it, he should forgo the car, building, servants, job, etc. Then, he should leave the place. Then he can refuse to do it... God gave us an employment called ‘body’. \nHe also gave us a kind of responsibility in this. He prepared the battlefield. He is commanding Arjuna to do it; how can he refuse? “You cannot escape.” If you are an achith vasthu (inert object), then this is not the case. i.e., a camera. Its duty is to record. \nIf you place it in a certain spot and command it to record, does it say… “How long should I do this?” “Why are you making me do this for so long? Give me some rest.” “I am getting overheated. It’s not comfortable. Give me a break!” It keeps doing the work for as long and for the purpose for which it is being used. \nAs it doesn’t have life, it does its duty properly. However, we humans are not like that. Since we came into this body with pra:na (life force), we cannot escape. Hence, He had to instruct. \nSri Krishna is instructing Arjuna… \nswarga dwa:ram apa:vrutham (Since you obtained this responsibility as I provided it to you). \nIf you do this well, I myself will bestow Heaven upon you. This doesn’t come to everyone who desires it. \nsukhinaha labhanthe: (Only for those who are good and worthy, only they get this opportunity). \ni:drusham yuddham (Thus, in verse 2.32, motivating Arjuna to fight), Sri Krishna proceeds further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is the best grandha (scripture), whose primary purpose is to provide direction on performing duties. Sri Krishna is its Upadeshta (teacher), the one who delivered it, through Arjuna, to guide us all about our duties.\nTypically, everyone has their own set of duties. Every person in this world is born with a duty to perform. It is good if we recognize our duty, but many people do not. They forget their primary duty, impose new ‘duties’ on themselves, and get into trouble in life. It is critical to perform our own duties, and equally critical to recognize that these duties are given to us by God - if we carry them out accordingly, then we don’t expect a specific result. Since we must perform the duties, we should do them sincerely, which will yield results naturally. \nWhen we perform our job properly, our salary gets deposited into our bank account at the end of the month. Similarly, if we properly perform the duties given by God with this body, we will certainly reap the appropriate result. Which is? This is specified by Sri Krishna in Bhagavad Gita 2.32. \nWhat will happen if we perform our duties properly?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvarga dva:ram apa:vrutham\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“For those who perform duties well, the doors of svarga (heaven) will open for them,” He says.\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna looked confused. Why? Arjuna had a strange expression while thinking - “I am not aiming for svarga, heaven.” I really don’t have to perform duties to go to svarga… “I have already visited svarga many times, honored by Indra and been received cordially by many others from svarga…” “Moreover, Indra is like my father. So, I don’t have to ‘do’ anything specifically to go to svarga. I can just go on my own.” \nSri Krishna responded to clarify Arjuna’s confusion.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvarga dva:ram apa:vrutham\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Svarga, the heaven I am referring to is not the one that you are thinking of… where Indra, Rambha, and others live.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThen what is svarga? There is a specific definition for that. At the beginning of Srimad Bhagavatam, it is mentioned that thousands of Rushis (sages) like Sounaka performed a dirgha sathra yaga (long sacrificial ritual). Why?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvarga:ya lo:ka:ya sahasra samama:satha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nperformed for many years\n-----------------------------------------------\nHow is it performed? Someone preaches an Upadesa (teaching), while others listen to enhance their knowledge. This is named as sathra yaga. Why are they performing dirgha sathra yaga? Svarga:ya lo:ka:ya – To reach the heavenly abode. Who is performing this yaga? Rushis and Seers, those who have renounced all worldly luxuries. \nWhy will they aspire for sweet nectar, amruth (nectar of immortality), or women like Rambha? They gave a detailed description of the svarga that they aspire for. That’s not the svarga, heaven, they are aspiring for. They aspire for the svarga mentioned by Nachiketas. \nIn Kato Upanishad, part of Veda, Yama Dharmaraja has a conversation with a child named Nachiketas. Yama Dharmaraja offered Nachiketas a sadhana (means), to achieve svarga. Nachiketas asked, “Which svarga?” Yama Dharmaraja responded: “Which svarga do you want?” Nachiketas said “nathathratvam najaraya:bhibhethi…” “I want the means to attain that svarga.” \nWhich svarga?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnathathrathvam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nwhere your influence doesn’t exist\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhose influence? Yama Dharmaraja’s influence. Where will Yama Dharmaraja’s influence exist? There is no place not under Yama’s influence including Earth, other planets…the entire universe. His influence exists in any corner you go. Yama Dharmaraja’s influence exists on people, kings, devatas (gods), gandharvas (celestial musicians)… or even Brahma, who is the first among devatas. \nOn average, we are all given 100 years to live. If we use them properly, we live all the 100 years. If we use them even better, we get bonus years. Otherwise, we lose some years. Generally, we all get 100 years, as our elders bless us with sathama:nam bhavathi (Live Long, live 100 years)! This duration is common. \nThe size of the unit time in the 100 varies. Some animals live only 20 years according to human calculation, but according to the calculation of that animal, it is 100 years. Mosquitos live only 3 or 4, maybe 20 days according to our calculation. According to mosquitos’ time calculation, that is 100 years. Some cells live only 4 hours. For that cell or that prani (one with life force), it is counted as 100 years. \nFor Brahma, the first of all beings… That Brahma’s one day according to our calculation is 2000 chaturyugas (great ages), 2000 X 4,320,000 human years. Based on that calculation, he also has 365 days and accordingly his 100 years. There is such a vast difference between our time and Brahma’s time. The moon’s half a day is our 15 days. That is why there are 15 days of daytime and 15 days of nighttime on the Moon. Thus, time is relative and changes accordingly. \nThe highest celestial being is Brahma. His son is Shiva, his son is Shanmukha or Ganapati and so on. Below Brahma are others like Yaksha, Rakshasa, Kinnera, Kimpurusha, Gandharva, etc. Ravana also lived many thousands of years. We hear about some beings living for many lakhs of years. Regardless of how long they live, they are all influenced by Yama. Even Brahma comes under the influence of Yama and must leave his post after his 100 years. Then, his successor will occupy the post. \nThat’s why it is said that the current Brahma is also not permanent. When we recite a sankalpa (oath), we say “adya brahmanaha” and tell the time-space. It mentions that we are in the current Brahma’s time, in which… 51 years, 1st day, 1st jhamu (part of a day), 1st ghadiya (hour) and 1st vighadiya (minute) have passed. According to our calculation, it is 200 crore years! There will be a variation of time. \nDespite the magnitude of his lifetime, Brahma is also under the influence of Yama Dharmaraja. So, you can imagine the greatness of Yama Dharmaraja. Nachiketas asked Yama Dharmaraja for that svarga which is nathathrathvam, not under the influence of Yama. “Likewise, najaraya:bhibhe:thi, there should not be any threat of old age, that’s the svarga I am interested in.” “It looks like only you know the means for it, so please tell me,” Nachiketas asked Yama Dharmaraja. \nThere is an amazing Upadesa about this in the Shanti Parva of Bharata.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyasmin o:shnam, na si:tham cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIn svarga, there is no exhaustion from a heat wave or suffering from a cold wave.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is a place above and beyond the influence of dvandas (duality) of heat or cold. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyenna dukhe:na sambhinnam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAlthough we may experience temporary pleasure, it gets ‘pushed off’ by something sad soon.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSad times begin then. Again, there may be an occasion where we are happy for a split second, like the duration of lightning, but it gets overshadowed by sorrow. Happiness and sorrow are constantly fluctuating like waves. “I want the svarga which is not impacted by the waves of happiness and sorrow,” says Nachiketas. \nAdditionally…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnachagrastham anantharam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nhappiness shouldn’t be temporary or depletable\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere is a practical example that demonstrates Indra’s svarga, heaven. Someone checks into a five-star hotel and pays a hefty deposit upfront for 24 hours. Right from the entrance, he is greeted by the staff “Good Morning, Sir!” He experiences luxuries, respect from the concierge, valet parking attendant, room service staff, etc. The staff inquires, “What can I do for you, sir?” \nHH used the English word ‘deposit’ | How long will the respect last? Only until the deposit amount lasts. As the deposit amount gets ‘used’ for his stay, the countdown starts for the balance of his stay, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, etc. Once it is at 0, if he doesn’t leave, he will be escorted forcibly. The luxuries in what is commonly referred to as [Indra’s] svarga, heaven, look like this. \nWe earn punya (virtues), accrued from hundreds of difficult lives with diligence and hard work. All this punya will be enough to experience the luxuries of heaven, maybe for a day. Upon entry into heaven, there is a board with the name of the person, and the amount of time allocated for him to stay, and the countdown starts immediately. Despite having all luxuries around him, he can’t enjoy them, as he is anxiously watching the timer. “The time is running out,” he cries and never enjoys the luxuries. Once the timer is out, he is thrown out.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkshi:ne: punye: madhya lo:kam visanthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\npunya is exhausted and he is sent back to Earth\n-----------------------------------------------\n“I don’t want happiness that gets depleted like this!” [Says Nachiketas]\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnachagrastham anantharam abhila:sho:pani:tham thath\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThat happiness, which is greatly desired by everyone…\n-----------------------------------------------\nand for which great souls such as Brahma perform severe penance to attain, is what I want.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthath sukham svarga pada:spadam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhat can it be? - One and only, Sri Maha Vishnu’s abode, paramapadam (supreme abode)!\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthad vishno: paramam padhagam sada: pasyanthi su:rayaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe one place named Paramapadam, which is the divine abode of Vishnu,\n-----------------------------------------------\nthat is the one place unaffected by dvandas (duality). Rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance) do not exist there. Veda says “rajasah para:keth, tamasah parasta:th.” That is svarga, Paramapadam! \nSri Krishna says, “Arjuna! Whoever performs their duty properly will achieve that svarga, Paramapadam… which gives eternal happiness, not the svarga which gives temporary small pleasures.” All the great souls who know tathva (truth), talk about this svarga, Paramapadam! \nSri Krishna is saying\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nYadruchchaya:cha upapannam svarga dva:ram apa:vrutham\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“This is a responsibility I assigned to you, to wage this war.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nFor Arjuna, it is waging war. For us, it is the responsibility of family or business, or any other duty given. If we fulfill this responsibility properly, without being carried away by happiness or sorrows, or aspiring for results, or succumbing to temporary happiness,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvarga dva:ram apa:vrutham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nwe will attain the place which bestows eternal happiness, Paramapadam\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is not attainable by everyone. You, Arjuna, are fortunate to have this opportunity, so perform your duty! Sri Krishna thus encourages Arjuna and explains the second dosham (fault), called asvargyam (not attaining heaven). Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita emerged to enlighten us on the truths of human life. Arjuna is a vya:jam (means). Sri Krishna’s intention is to teach us all about performing duties, by keeping Arjuna at the forefront.\nBy birth, we all inherit duties. However, we don’t feel like fulfilling those duties. We feel happy if we have comfortable duties, but there is no rule for that to be the case. Occasionally, they can be difficult. We feel like ignoring those duties or leaving them behind. We feel like taking on others. Just as we do not have the authority to select our body, we do not have the authority to select our duties. You can’t say, “These eyes are not good, this nose is not good, these ears are also not good. Instead, I want four horns, hanging ears similar to that of Giri cows, or a new nose similar to a bird’s beak.” Some people put on masks like this, but of course, these are temporary. When someone says they don't like their body parts, it's unacceptable, right? We do not have any option to choose our body at all, nor do we have a right to decide at all. Someone gave us [this body]. We have no choice but to accept it. Whatever the color and form, we simply accept and live with this body. That’s what we are doing now anyway. Of course, everyone feels like their body is an amazing one. Others may not feel that way, yet we all feel that about ourselves. There is no opportunity to change this [body] in the way you want. Similarly, we do not have a choice to modify the processes and procedures that come along with the body. We have to follow them. If we do not follow them, we will get three dosha:s (faults), advises Sri Krishna.\nAna:rya jushtam (ignoring duties), Asvargyam (disqualification for heaven), and Aki:rthikaram (loss of fame) are the three do:shas (faults). Ana:rya jushtam – if we ignore the duties and do whatever we want, none of our well-wishing elders will appreciate that. This is one do:sha. We tried to learn clearly about this in the earlier sessions. Asvargyam – if we disregard the duties, despite our [soul’s] stay here [in the body], it gives rise to sorrow and removes happiness. It will disqualify us for svarga (heaven). We tried to discuss svarga in previous sessions. Svarga is not just another temporary world amongst many other worlds. It is a place that gives permanent happiness and bliss; it is the abode of God. Regardless of how meager the task, if it is performed by a person sincerely, the result for that is also mo:ksha (eternal blissful state)!\nWe see some people cleaning the roads. That was assigned as a duty. If he performs that duty with the right garb, following the right process properly, then maybe someday the Prime Minister may come and clean his feet! Similar to how it was done in Kumbhame:la and other places. You never know! If you perform your duty properly, there is a chance that God’s blessing will be directly bestowed upon you. That’s the state of mo:ksha, right? That state will be bestowed upon you permanently!\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvarga dva:ram apa:vrutham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf he performs his duty, that becomes dharma (righteous practice). Because of dharma, righteous virtue, svarga will be attained.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndharme:na pa:pam apanugathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf you follow dharma, all the pa:pa (negative results of bad actions) will be completely cleared. If they [pa:pas] are alleviated, svarga will be close to him… or accessible for experiencing it. He can attain it!\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is clarified in [second do:sha, asvargyam]. If you disregard your duty, then elders, the wise will not appreciate. [ana:rya jushtam]. It is an ‘enemy’ to svarga. You will be disqualified for it. [It will be] asvargyam. “Arjuna, the third one is aki:rthikaram.” You will lose your ki:rthi (fame). What did Arjuna think? “Why should I even do this in the first place?” You said I will attain svarga. I don’t want that. You said dharma, I don’t care about dharma, why should I do that? I don’t want anything – dharma, a:thma (soul), parama:thma (Supreme Soul), God, evil forces, etc. I will just do my work, whatever result comes, I will eat and mind my own business. I will neither go to ‘that’ place nor ‘this’ place. I won’t do anything! I will just mind my own business. Why do I need all these [disturbances]?” We hear some people ask such questions. In fact, minding our own business and doing our own work itself is called dharma! However, stopping one's work is not dharma. If we ignore whatever we are supposed to do, we cannot stay human.\nTake the example of trees. They give us everything without any expectations. They give us fruits, flowers, leaves, branches, and twigs. They never ask anything in return despite giving everything. They only give. Even if the tree sheds its leaves, it will replenish with the new leaves on its own and give us new fruits. We are observing this in all trees. If we do our duty properly, we will be bestowed with uththama stthithi (a better state). Performing your duties results in such a state. In the case of Arjuna, he said, “I won’t wage war, I don’t need svarga. I don’t mind going to naraka (hell).” “Whatever is destined will happen. I will mind my own business.” To Arjuna: “Can you live like that?” Once you [Arjuna] go away from here [battlefield] to there [out in community], if someone says, “He [Arjuna] is simply a coward. He is just a showoff but in reality, he is just incapable.” After you walk away, your pourusham (manhood) will be hurt/enraged! Then you will ask yourself, “Am I like that?” When you have the opportunity, you are ignoring [your duty]. When someone says something, you will return when your ego becomes enraged. At that time, you will not have My support. I will just leave you alone in your flow.\nIn fact, Arjuna earlier used [similar to] all these upade:sas (teachings) of Sri Krishna to [motivate] another person. There is someone named Uttara Kuma:ra. He used to spin many tall yarns. He [once] said, “Did Kauravas come? If only I had a good sa:rathi (charioteer), I would tear them apart.” Arjuna heard all that. At that time, Arjuna was with them as Bruhannala. Arjuna said, “I was a charioteer to many elders previously. I will be happy to be one for you as well.” Finally, Uttara Kumara reluctantly agreed and took Arjuna with him. Once they arrived at the war field, they looked at the army…thathra: pasyath! Uttara Kumara looked at everyone, spread everywhere.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkshve:la he:shitha brumhithaihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe described it, “On one side, horses neighing, on the other, elephants trumpeting, all the soldiers yelling!” \n-----------------------------------------------\n“They were lifting the bows and swords up high. What is all this? “At our house, all these are on the walls.” “The elephant just stays still, the horse stays still, and the chariot stays still.” “Even people would just lift the sword and stay still.” “That’s how I thought they would all be here, but they are all moving, doing something.” “I cannot stay here.” On that day, Arjuna himself gave upade:sa (teaching) to Uttara Kumara. When it’s time to preach, people become as great as Vya:sa and Para:sara [great preachers]. When it is their turn, we should notice what happens. Today is Arjuna’s turn, where there is a need to wage war. On that day Uttara Kumara got down from the chariot and ran away from the war. Similarly, today Arjuna is under the influence of thamo:guna (mode of ignorance), and has started talking this way. To him, dharma seemed like adharma (unrighteousness), and he wanted to avoid fulfilling his duty. That’s why there was a need for this upade:sa, preaching.\n“My dear, you are thinking this is ki:rthi (fame). However, this is not fame. It is aki:rthi (disgrace).” Because you are unable to live like that [like a tree]. As discussed previously, trees give fruits and flowers. Let's say the tree doesn't produce for one year. Many people complain, asking, “What happened to this tree? It used to produce so much before, but it doesn’t anymore.” Hearing this, it [tree] doesn’t cry. It doesn’t fight with them or complain about their lack of gratitude. It doesn’t even realize that you are taking its fruit. Even if you hit it with stones, it doesn’t talk. Can you live like that [like a tree]? Can you be so sincere? No! Then how can you say, “I will just do my own work, why do I need God and evil forces? I don’t need any of them. I will just eat something and mind my own business.” You won’t be able to live like that! It is not possible. What will happen once all your people start talking about you?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nadha che:thvam dharmyam imam sangra:mam na karishyasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf at all you deny waging this dha:rmic yudha (righteous war)…\nIt looks like you are already in that state of mind. You have already thrown the bow and arrows. Your words are crossing all limits, and you have already collapsed in the chariot.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf you avoid waging war where dharma is not transgressed… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsangra:mam na karishyasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthen… \n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthathasva dharmam ki:rthincha hithva: pa:pam ava:psyasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou will become the one who has infringed dharma. Perhaps you are thinking that people might say, “Arjuna was so kind and stopped the war, he is so good, he ensured no one got hurt.” You won’t hear that from anyone. Before the war, you bragged to them about performing penance to earn different weapons. People will say that you fled the war when the time came because you were a coward. Will you be able to bear that? First of all, you will earn pa:pa (the result of bad action) for not performing dharma. Then you will become infamous, and people will curse you badly. At that time, what’s the use if you show off your ego? That’s why it is not right to [forego dharma].\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nhithva: pa:pam ava:psyasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nLord shows the third reason, aki:rthi (infamy). In order to show this, at the beginning of verse 2.33 itself, He said aththa (therefore)…\nWhenever starting with aththa, it means it is continuing from the old verse into the new verse. It will not stop at earning you pa:pa.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naki:rthimcha:pi bhu:tha:ni kadhaishyanthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll the people will start making up stories regarding you. \n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nAvyaya:m – people will not just talk [about it] one day and stop.\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThey will talk about it for the rest of your life.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsambha:vithasya cha aki:rthihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nPeople will discuss your ego, and past incidents where you demonstrated your valor, but then they will criticize and dishonor you.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmarana:gathirichyathe\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou will feel like dying; it will make you want to jump into something and die. \n-----------------------------------------------\nOne more thing… As long as someone talks good about him, after a person leaves the body, that’s how long he will be in the uththama lo:kas (upper worlds). As long as someone in this world talks bad about him, after a person leaves the body, that is how long he will be suffering in the worlds of sorrow.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naki:rthiryasya gi:ye:tha lo:ke: bhu:thasya kasyachith \nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen Ra:ma sends Si:tha to the forest. \n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npathathye:va:dhama:n lo:ka:n ya:vath sabdaha sagi:yathe\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe one about whom the people are talking badly, regardless of who it is, whether it’s me [Ra:ma] or a commoner, or a great person, he will be suffering in the adhama loka:s (lower worlds). How long? As long as the people of this world are going to talk about it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is the responsibility of the wise to act in such a way that people are not talking badly about them. You are a wise one. So do not strive for aki:rthi (infamy). If you need to work for ki:rthi (fame), then you have to follow dharma. You are facing a dharma yuddha (righteous war). It is your duty. Get up and do well! Sri Krishna mentioned and nearly addressed all the details of the three do:shas (faults). Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), today we will explore the theme of loss and reputation. Who incurs loss? It is the one who has wealth that incurs it. \nWhat about pathanam (degradation)? Who undergoes pathanam? It is the one at a high position who undergoes pathanam. How can someone who is always at the bottom undergo pathanam? He is already at the bottom. The one who lives in poverty, without money or clothes, will not incur any loss. There is nothing for him to lose. \nLoss occurs only to those who have wealth. Who gets apaki:rthi (infamy)? Only the one who is famous gets apaki:rthi. An ‘unknown’ person is neither famous nor infamous. Therefore, loss occurs only to those who have wealth. \nArjuna, you are wealthy! In the past, you earned good fame in this world. You have good wealth and the ability to get work done. You are popular as a savyasa:chi (ambidextrous archer), known for using the bow equally well with either hand. You have earned a reputation that you must retain. It is your responsibility not to lose it. \nThus, you must perform your duty to ensure that there is no opportunity for people to slander you. The world commends only the one who performs his duty and condemns the one who disregards it. The one who is loyal and persistent towards his duty, focused on his goal, earns an “Aha! Great” from the people in the world! You have that in you! \nBecause of this, if you lose it, you do not need to actually die. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naki:rthim cha:pi bhu:tha:ni\nkatthayishyanthi the:vyaya:m |\nsambha:vithasya cha aki:rthihi\nmarana:d athirichyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“People will speak ill of you, and infamy will befall you, which is worse than death.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna says in verse 2.34, “If you avoid the war and disregard your duty, you will get three do:shas (faults).” Sri Krishna started the second chapter of Bhagavad Gita saying this. \nHe mentions how it is ana:ryajushtam (unacceptable by well-wishing elders) and asvargyam (not leading to heaven). If you avoid the war, you will not only lose sadgathi (eternal bliss) but will attain durgathi (a deteriorated state of existence). \nThe third one... No matter how disengaged you want to be with everything, and how little you believe in it, you would want to live a life of dignity and comfort, right? What is the point of living a life where everyone curses you? Thus, be aware that you will live a cursed life and become infamous. \nHe proves this in five verses: 2.33, 2.34, 2.35, 2.36, and 2.37. There is nothing worse than living an infamous life. It is marana:d athirichyathe: (worse than death). He becomes like la:ghavam (weightless). He carries less weight than a grass blade. Nobody really cares about him. He will be ignored, just as you ignore a grass blade. \nIs it acceptable for you to live like that? That is not the kind of person you are, right? Because when you talk, it seems as if you know the dharma (righteous practice), but your actions are like an adharmic (one who does not follow dharma). \nOn that day, when Draupadi was being insulted in the assembly, were you all weaklings? Dharmaraja (Yudhishthira), Bhima, you, Nakula, and Sahadeva – each of you are all jagad jatti:lu (world-renowned warriors). You could have beaten Dussasana when he was bringing Draupadi. Duryodhana could have been crushed. Each one of the five of you is capable of doing this. But you did not do it. \nWhy didn’t you do it? Because you believe in elders, respect, dharma, promises, and adhering to norms. You were bound by beliefs in these concepts, hence you did not dare to do anything. There was a chance for you to act at that time, but you did not. \nBecause of the utmost respect for your elder brother, you just folded your hands and sat quietly, regardless of how much Draupadi was humiliated. You never went against anyone in the assembly. Despite Vikarna's attempts to preach morality, they asked him to sit down. You did not respond to that either. \nThis proves that you have a certain level of understanding of dharma. You have reverence for the words of the elders. In your mind, you have the feeling that nobody should talk ill about you. If you did not feel that at all, then you wouldn’t even be in this situation. \nTherefore, do not ruin the reputation which you have earned so far. If good people are reprimanding us, it is for our own good. Usually, elders who are good people have our best interests in mind. If they have reprimanded us because they probably saw some fault in us, it is only to correct our incorrect behavior. Their rebuke is like a blessing. Their rebuke shows us the right path. It is good for us. \nHowever, if a worthless person reprimands you, will you put up with that? Should you endure insults from a worthless person, who was beaten up by you previously? You may accept it if a well-wisher is criticizing you. Why is there a need to bear the critique from someone who wishes ill of you? \nNote to Anjani when video reviewing: Verified with Nina ji on this frame. This is what was advised. Kauravas and the like who are around you are all worthless. They will also humiliate you by looking at your condition today. They will claim, “Oh, what great cock and bull stories Arjuna told earlier.” They will compare what you have said previously and what you are doing now and criticize you. This is great infamy! \nTherefore, if you should not succumb to their words, you need to perform your duty. What will they say? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbhaya:d rana:d uparatham manyanthe: thva:m maha:rattha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“They will think that you, the great warrior, have fled the battle out of fear.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn the end, they might say that even though Arjuna bragged previously, he fled the war showing his back, because of fear. They have admired you as the greatest one of them all. The same tongues will blame you in different ways. You will look insignificant in front of them. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nava:chyava:da:ms cha bahu:n vadishyanthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“They will speak many contemptuous words about you.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna says, “Bhishma and the like are all maha:radhis (great charioteers). It does not matter even if they reprimand me.” Sri Krishna says, “If they (Bhishma and other elders) reprimand you, it is not an issue. But it is not they.” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nava:chyava:da:ms cha bahu:n vadishyanthi thava:hitha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Those who wish for your loss are the ones who speak this hostile talk.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nYour abilities will be held in contempt by them. Then you feel the heat, your inflamed ego. It becomes a moot point at that time. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthatho: dukhatharam nu kim\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“You will be in grief if elders reprimand you, but if worthless people denounce you, then that is greater grief.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nTherefore, when you hear their humiliating, provoking words, there is absolutely no use being exasperated at that time when they underplay your capability. There is no need for you to become a victim of such situations. \nWhat to do? You asked what to do. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyachchre:yas sya:n nischitham bru:hi thanme:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Whatever You [Sri Krishna] think is sre:yas (favorable) for me [Arjuna], or whatever is decided by the Elders, the wise…”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is what you asked me [Sri Krishna], right Arjuna? Now listen...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nhatho: va: pra:psyase: svargam jithva: va: bho:kshyase: mahi:m |\nthasma:d uththishtta kaunthe:ya yuddha:ya krutha nischayaha ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“If you are killed in battle, you will attain heaven; if you win, you will enjoy ruling this world. Therefore, arise, O Kaunteya (son of Kunti), and prepare for battle!”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna is making a verdict. In this righteous war, victory or defeat is at the discretion of God. It is not in our control. Someone who might think they are strong might become useless. \nThere is a story regarding a king in Haryana who fought a war against the Mughal empire. He probably fought a war against Shah Jahan. The king was able to retaliate against the Mughal army with great valor. He fought with great skill. However, towards the end of the war, the elephant on which the king was riding lost an eye. An arrow from someone hit the eye of the elephant. The elephant lost his eyesight and went into a spin which disabled the king. With that, the Mughal army conquered the kingdom and that is how the rise of the Mughal empire began. \nIn war, victory or defeat is not in our control. The one who anticipates victory might be defeated for some reason! The one who anticipates a defeat might suddenly turn around and become amazingly victorious. Regardless...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nhatho:va..\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“If you are killed in battle as part of performing your duty, then there is nothing to worry.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe discussed svarga (heaven) earlier, where there is no sorrow or happiness, where there is no old age and death, where it is beyond dualities, and is the best place, which is the abode of God. You will attain that svarga. Moksha (liberation) is destined for the one who performs his duties. You will definitely attain it. \nAlternatively...\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\njithva: va: bho:kshyase: mahi:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“If you win the battle, you will enjoy happiness by virtue of ruling this world.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf you win the battle, you will enjoy happiness by virtue of ruling this world. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:d uththishtta kaunthe:ya !\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Without hesitation, Rise! Get ready to wage war!”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWithout hesitation, Rise! Get ready to wage war! \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuddha:ya krutha nischayaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“If you wage war, you will be executing your duty.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf you wage war, you will be executing your duty. Do not contemplate the benefit of doing it. Thus, Sri Krishna is preaching to Arjuna that war itself is the most appropriate task to do. \nBoth the armies came this far, not necessarily because you wanted. However, even you have prepared yourself and arrived here and come this far. You have now reached a point of no return. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:d uththishtta kaunthe:ya!\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Arise and get ready!”\n-----------------------------------------------\nArise and get ready! Thus, Sri Krishna is preparing Arjuna to get ready for war. This is the third reason. \nThe three reasons were discussed thus far. What are the three reasons? Ana:ryajushtam, asvargyam, aki:rthikaram. If you avoid the war, in this way, at this time, you will get three do:shas. \nA need arose to describe the three do:shas and justify how they are do:shas. Thus far, Sri Krishna explained the do:shas which Arjuna will specifically acquire if he disregards his duty. Now, He is going to generalize it. \nWhatever was explained as applicable to one individual [Arjuna], He [Sri Krishna] is applying it in general for any individual who is assigned a task, clarifying that no one should step back from their duty. Only then, one will become eligible for moksha. \nTo generalize this, starting from verse 2.38, He begins the upade:sa (teaching). It is called karma nishta (dedication to duty). If someone remains true to his duty, he will become the one who has executed his karma properly. Starting from verse 2.38, He will begin to establish karma. If duty is performed properly, it would become karma. Then it will become karma yoga (the path of action), if done appropriately. \nLet us try to understand this in the upcoming sessions. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a wonderful teaching. The second chapter is especially a very valuable teaching for the current times. Why? Many people are suffering from Covid-19 in various ways. We also see people losing their family members. People have lost their loved ones and relatives, and are experiencing grief in many ways. It is an unbearable situation. In such situations, chapter 2 is very useful in building mental strength and resilience.\nBhagavan (Lord), Sri Krishna, clarified the reality of the body (sari:ra) and soul (atma). Each person has to do his duty. Your dharma (duty) is to perform your responsibilities. What obstructs one from performing duty is lack of clarity about what should and shouldn’t be done. The reason for this is tamas guna (ignorance). \nWhat is atma and what is not atma? It is called atma-nonatma viveka (knowledge of the differences between the soul and that which is not the soul). If we understand this, we will attain a satvik shakti (strength born out of virtues) to continue our dharma. It allows one to see things distinctly. Because of that, one understands his duty and acts accordingly.\nGenerally, when we lose our loved ones, sorrow ensues. “Does God exist? If He is there, why would He do this? What is all this? Why did He give us this trouble?” These thoughts arise in one’s mind. This kind of thinking is not necessary. We see many species in nature. They also experience joys and sorrows. They face their troubles and move forward. However, they do not stop their activities.\nYet, when a human faces trouble or ill health or an unfavorable situation, he thinks, “Why should I continue my activities? Why should I behave in a favorable way with everyone? Why help others? Why should I have satvik food? Do japa (chanting) or tapa (austerity)? Or meditate? Why should I believe in God?” Then we usually see that he feels reluctant towards those activities. As long as everything is favorable, he feels he is able to ‘do’ everything. However, when things don’t go our way, these thoughts manifest.\nA man needs counsel in such times. Sri Krishna did not deliver Bhagavad Gita only for Bharatiyas (Indians) or Vaidiks (those who believe in Vedas). In fact, this is needed for every prani (being), mainly for human beings, it is very essential. Religions, castes, skin tones, and languages may be different. Still, life is the same for everyone. Taking birth, growing up, necessity of food, favorable or unfavorable situations are all common for everyone. Facing troubles is common for everyone. There is no difference.\nHence, when such things [Covid-19] happen, we need to understand what and how to think. This is something we all have experienced. As long as there is prani (soul) in the body, we love and care for it in many ways. We try to handle the body carefully. We don’t mind spending any amount of money for it. We don’t mind taking loans to care for it. We are currently witnessing people being hastily admitted into hospitals even on the slightest deterioration in health. We have to accept the reason for that behavior.\nThese days, when something terrible happens to someone, it does not occur gradually. Like a fruit which ripens gradually, it’s not like that nowadays. Infections in current times [like Covid-19] are not like that. Once infected, it reaches its peak in a day or two - sometimes in half a day. Then comes the horrible situation of shortness of breath - soon the person is no more. Such are the situations. It’s difficult to believe that hospitals may be able to protect us. It is a fact that they are doing what they can to some extent. \nDespite lakhs of rupees per day spent, are hospitals providing patients oxygen or good medicines? We rarely hear positive comments about that. We cannot underestimate anyone. There are capable doctors who do their job. There are others who don’t care about the patients, focusing only on making money. However, in the news, most of the time we hear stories of tremendous suffering. After using ‘influence’ and spending so much money, if they are lucky, they return home. Otherwise, they are directly sent to ‘Swarga Dham’ (what many cemeteries are named). The family simply returns home. This is, in fact, a heartbreaking situation.\nWe should remember two things in times like these. \n1. To keep ourselves healthy, we need immunity, a protective shield, for our body. How do we keep physically strong? Proper food, ventilation, yoga, exercise, pranayama (breath control), or by eating specific, recommended foods… instead of going to the doctors and troubling them for everything. There are many people who are showing us alternatives. If we can use preventive measures and pick something that suits us from among those, we may be able to preserve our health to some extent. We have to do this as far as the body is concerned. Keeping a distance from people, sanitizing our hands - whenever and however necessary, following sanitization protocols, and avoiding unnecessary crowds in addition to other measures. All these pertain to the body level.\n2. Activities which you have to do to strengthen your mind. Why do we love this body? Because there is something indwelling in it, otherwise we wouldn’t love it. Not just us, no one will love it. Not just any particular religion. No one from any religion would love the body without an indwelling soul. They don’t keep the body after the soul leaves. Even if they do, the body won’t stay. Slowly it will start to disintegrate, then stink and appear horrendous. That’s why it’s necessary to immediately do some procedures so we don’t have to see the body. \nSince the one that is visible outside (body) cannot stay without this qualification, it becomes known as sari:ra (body). The one making it stay in proper condition is atma (soul). What others call it, we can leave it to them, but we call it atma. The reason is we don’t know where it is or how big it is. But it is present in everything, wherever it is, giving everything life. Hence it is called atma. Thus, the body and soul are different. The soul always exists but the body can’t exist forever no matter what. The body exists now because the soul is along with it. They are placed together carefully in such a way that they cannot be separated.\nThere is a beautiful name for this relation… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\napruthak siddha sambandham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhich means the relationship is such that they cannot exist in isolation.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey are together. As long as they are together, we respect them in many ways. We respect both body and soul. Regarding the soul, we say he is a great person. Looking at the body we may say “she is related to us, she is beautiful” or other statements. The one that is visible outside (body) is existing because of the indwelling soul. So we must recognize the soul inside. And know that they are together, but not one.\nWhat are they like? The one inside (soul) is called de:hi (the one who dwells). The outside one (body) is called de:ha (the physical body). De:hi is eternal - whatever you do, it won’t go. The one outside (body) will be there as long as the soul is with it; after that, it won’t exist no matter what you do. The one inside (soul) is avadhyaha (immortal), with no death. However, for the body, whatever you do, there is no e:ka ru:patha (same form). This is not just for humans. The same applies for animals or any prani (being) with life. Hence, we should think of all these.\nFor as long as it belongs to us and is favorable to us, we should use it for righteous activities. We should make sure time is not wasted. We should utilize every single minute. Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2 distinguishes between both - atma and anathma (non-soul), de:ha and de:hi. Chapter 2 holds a special role in giving us this knowledge. In present times, it is essential for everyone to read and understand it. We are somewhat content to be able to put some effort towards it. Let’s try to do so every day. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna was averse to waging war. He felt killing relatives was unacceptable. It was his responsibility to wage war that day, but he felt an aversion for it. Arjuna would have rather begged for alms. After hearing this, Sri Krishna felt it was necessary to teach Arjuna the importance of performing duties. Sri Krishna started giving him an upadesa (teaching). \nSri Krishna described the 3 defects a man would acquire if he stops performing his duties: \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nana:rya jushtam\naswargyam\naki:rthikaram\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThese are considered unworthy, lead to no heavenly reward, and bring disgrace.\n-----------------------------------------------\nOne would acquire these 3 defects. Hence no one should stop performing their duties. Though directly addressing Arjuna, He was conveying this to all of mankind. We did not acquire these bodies out of desire. None of us. No one acquired a body out of choice. Someone gave it to us. Whoever provided it, provided it to us to serve a purpose. Whatever purpose it was provided for, we should use it for that purpose. He [God] bestows one the samskaras (characteristics), based on karmic records. That person is formed based on samskaras and tendencies. He will have a few responsibilities based on birth, upbringing, education, environment, and needs. \nBecause of these responsibilities, one needs to perform a few activities. These activities could be anything from being a cobbler, butcher, chef, or other kinds of jobs. There is no need to specifically state a particular activity. Based on his situation, he will need to do some specific task. Everyone has to do something for livelihood, for fulfilling his responsibility towards family. We have to perform these activities without any hesitation. This is the essence. We get some benefits out of them, sometimes favorable and other times unfavorable experiences. You must perform your duty, regardless of being favorable or unfavorable. \nIf you get favorable experiences, enjoy them. Even if you get unfavorable experiences, don’t cry and stop performing your duty. Don’t turn back. Continue doing it. This is what a man has to do. If in the middle of a river, someone contemplates “I can’t swim, I’m tired.” What will happen? He will simply drown. Even if difficult, he should strive until he gets some support, to reach the river bank… or a boat happens to come by, or even just getting support of a stick to float. It might be strenuous for him, but he has to continue. Once he gets support, he can happily proceed without any effort. \nOnce in a favorable situation, one should not get too excited. Neither become depressed if encountering an unfavorable situation. Don’t take either situation to heart. Of course, one would feel them temporarily. If someone puts a block of ice on you, you will feel cold. You would feel nice if someone puts something warm on you. Or if someone applies a good fragrance on you, you would enjoy it. You would feel disgusted if you smell some bad odor. Temporarily, these are inevitable. But whether you feel it is favorable or unfavorable, you must not avoid your responsibilities. This is what a man needs to understand. \nIf he can perform his responsibility in this way, he is fulfilling his dharma (duty) at some level. Elevate this a little further… “God has given me this responsibility. Performing this gives Him happiness.” “So I will fulfill it and go ahead.” If one can think like this, a slight change in his thought pattern… Instead of adding new karmic records, it may erase his old records and make him eligible for promotion to a better state of existence. He did not stop his activity but has transformed the way his mind receives it. If he can make this slight change, there will be a wonderful change in the result which he gets. \nTo do it this way, whatever activity he is doing should be “I am doing this as God’s service. Whatever it is, it is my duty to do this.” If he can think like this and go forward, he is then known as a mumukshu (seeker). We should recognize the difference in that word. In general, he is a human being but if the thought process changes, he becomes mumukshu. Normally what he does is an activity, but if he changes his thought process and does it... the same activity becomes ‘karma yoga’ for him. Karma yoga is not something new which you get from somewhere. It means doing whatever activity you are doing by qualifying it with the thought process. This is mandatory for every human being. \nSri Krishna is addressing Arjuna and instructing us how to inculcate this change in thought process. That day, Arjuna had to wage war. That was his responsibility. Sri Krishna is commanding Arjuna to fulfill that duty. Today, we have some responsibility. Whatever responsibilities we have for our livelihood and other duties... we have to fulfill those without hesitation and move ahead. While moving ahead, we should not be carried away by potential favorable or unfavorable experiences. Temporarily, we may have some feelings due to them. If it is favorable, we might feel like smiling. When unfavorable, it’s expressed on our face. This can’t be avoided. They are signs of our being alive. If he doesn’t feel those, that means he is not alive. \nThese, he will and should feel. But giving excessive importance to them and being carried away by them is not right. Duty is important. Whatever comes through while performing them is ok. When traveling by car and facing a sudden torrential rain… we don’t cry, “oh, there is rain!” Or if it is very hot, we don’t shout “oh, it is so hot!” Sometimes our path is filled with rocks and sand, we do not feel bad, or if we see a smooth road, we don’t get excited that it is so wonderful. We continue our journey as we have to reach our destination. We have to keep the goal in mind, continue our activity, and whatever comes in between, we should accept. \nSri Krishna embarks further by instructing this in verse 2.30.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nde:hi: nithyam avadhyo:yam de:he: sarvasya bha:ratha! |\nthasma:th sarva:ni bhu:tha:ni na thvam so:chithum arhasi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe soul (dehi) is eternal and cannot be killed, so do not grieve for any living being.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis dehi (soul) is common for everyone. But their dehas (bodies) are formed based on samskaras and karmas from previous lives. One gets a hard body, while another gets a softer body. One gets a human body while the other gets an animal body. Of those, one might get a deer body and the other might get a body like a rhinoceros. One might get a tender body and the other might get a very tough body like a tortoise… whose shell doesn’t get affected by anything. These are changes in bodies. Even in humans, one is fair and another is dark. One may get a body which is born rich, while another is born poor. One may have an exceptional ability to remember everything hearing it once. Another may be so dull-headed that he might hear it multiple times but still doesn’t understand. \nBased on their situation, they may get different states. This is for bodies. Dehas (bodies), whatever they are - He gave to us temporarily to experience karma. It is important for us to remember that ‘He gave it.’ Whatever activity we have to do with the body which He gave is svadharma (personal duty). Paradharma (contrary duty) is contrary to that. We came into this body, then what is our svadharma? When in water, then what is our svadharma? When in water, svadharma is to swim. When on land, svadharma is to run. When on land, we can’t say we will swim. When in water, we can’t say we will run. When in water, we have to swim. Just as we see the external environments [land, water]... when in a particular body, the activity which we do becomes svadharma. \nWhatever one does contrary to that, stopping duties related to that body, thinking that only knowledge is important… if he says “I will go into some yoga or meditation”... that is paradharma for him. He is in a particular body, but wants to do something contrary to that body. That is paradharma, not svadharma. Hence, Sri Krishna tells Arjuna in verse 2.31,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvadharmam api cha:ve:kshya\nna vikampithum arhasi |\ndharmya:ddhi: yuddha:th sre:yo::nyath\nkshathriyasya na vidyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTo wage war is your svadharma. But you shouldn’t initiate it with petty quarrels.\n-----------------------------------------------\n“To wage war is your svadharma. But you shouldn’t initiate it with petty quarrels.” You received an opportunity to stop an erring man from erring and protecting others from him... to stop him from degrading further by committing more sins. You have an opportunity to put an end to this by waging war. Hence, it is a dharmya yuddha (righteous war), a war where dharma is not transgressed. If we start a war by getting into petty quarrels with others... then it is not a dharmya yuddha, righteous war, but becomes adharma yuddha (unrighteous war). But you didn’t get into it [this war] like that. They themselves got the war ready for you. Now you have got an opportunity to contain their mistakes. Restrain them. This is a good opportunity for you. Even if you want to reform them, this is a good opportunity for you. You have faith in that good activity. Hence, this is suitable for you. \nWhoever is in any occupation and faces any troubling situation while performing their duties… this wonderful verse [2.31] provides relief. Sri Krishna clarifies here that one’s occupation is one’s svadharma. While looking at it, na vikampithum arhasi (you need not become scared). You need not become scared thinking whether to do it or not. A doctor gives injections. Piercing the skin is his natural dharma. He can do it. It is not a sin for him. For others, it is. For you, Arjuna, your activity is a righteous war, dharmya. Just do it. Thus, Sri Krishna delivers Gita Upadesa (teaching), motivating Arjuna to fulfill his duties. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "episode": 89,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), A person secures three benefits by carrying out his duties. When he does not fulfill his duties, there are three losses. What are the benefits?\nFirst one: The well-wishers and elders of society will praise us if we can fulfill our responsibilities. This is what they expect from us. Everyone should do their own chores and be happy. The One who gave us this body also gave us certain things to do. Whatever chores He has given along with the body, do them properly. One must finish the tasks given by Him, for Him, right? So, finish the given task. This is what The Wise want from us. What they expect is that we understand that the soul (atma) and the body (deha) are different entities... that the soul lasts forever... and that because the body is temporarily formed to accomplish certain responsibilities of this soul for us, we must complete our work. If we understand this, it makes our Elders happy.\nIf we stay in here and refuse to work, it is like getting a job from an employer and reaping profits from it… yet not doing the assigned work but whatever we wish. That becomes punishable, and is not accepted by the Elders. It is a:ryajushtam (noble) when we complete our work. When we do not, it is ana:ryajushtam (ignoble). This makes the Elders unhappy. Explaining this to Arjuna, Sri Krishna said, “if you do not fight this war it is ana:ryajushtam.” You [Arjuna] do it, and I will impart the necessary wisdom. Saying this, He spoke in detail about the existence of deha (body) and atma (soul) starting from verse 12 to 31. That is approximately 18 verses.\nSecond one: If we can successfully complete the work that we are supposed to, which means… we should be able to understand the purpose of this body… and what He, the one who gave us the body, wants from us, and behave accordingly. How will we know this? Will He come and tell us? The answer is sa:sthra (scripture), which is an order given by Him. When we follow what our elders preached from the scriptures correctly, we will attain Swarga (heaven). We have discussed earlier what Swarga is. Swarga is a place that is resistant to changes like heat or cold, where there is no grief, but only favorable feelings, one that is never lost once attained, and it is something that when one has knowledge about it, he desperately wants it. When we analyze what it is according to our scriptures, it is known by various names such as Paramapada (Supreme Abode) or Vaikunta (abode of Vishnu). The same is named as ‘Swarga’.\nWhen we properly fulfill our responsibilities, we will attain that Swarga. When will we attain Swarga? If we have this body, we cannot have it. If someone says we can have Swarga right away at death… would we rather be in a hospital with COVID ready for death? We want to be alive! We should be alive. We should be ‘alive’ till the last breath in this body. We should live with positivity and happiness. However, Bhagavan (the Lord) has been telling us that this is not everlasting, right? Which means someday it will be separated from us and similarly, we will be free of it. After that, what will happen to us? What happens to the body will be known to people around us. Or what happens to another’s body will be known to us.\nEarlier, they used to perform samskara (rituals), qualify the body for the next stage, and dispose of it in a proper method. But these days, it is done using alternative methods. Relatives are neither allowed near the body nor to touch it or see it [due to the COVID-19 pandemic]. People are instructed to stay far away and perform all the rituals needed. The body is disposed of at once. Whatever it is. This is what the body goes through. But what we [soul] undergo is different. We know what happens to the body after death. It reunites, some way or another, with panchabhuta (five elements) of Nature from which it is formed. What happens to us [soul]? Once we [soul] leave the body, we must go somewhere. Either to such a body, or a body which is worse than this, or one better than this. Which one would we prefer to go into? Not an awful one. If we get one similar to this, that’s still ok, but a better one is preferred. If the better one is indestructible and gives everlasting happiness, that is what we wish for. This is named Swarga.\nWe find different interpretations of this from different sources. The great sages performed sathra yaga (sacrificial rituals) in places like Naimisaranya to attain Swarga. Although they all were great people, they performed this [the yaga] for sahasra samama:satha (thousands of years). We are not referring to that which is ruled by Indra (the king of heaven). We are talking about the desirable Swarga, where there is no grief and no return to this material plane, where happiness multiplies, and is always favorable to you. This is called Swarga. If we accomplish our responsibilities while in this body, and continue to do the same, we will obtain it.\nSometimes we win, and sometimes lose. When we lose [the election] after a tough campaign ignoring the comforts, for days and nights… we grieve for a while but… if we overcome this temporary grief and move forward with the thought of… ‘This was my responsibility which I fulfilled, but the result is His wish.’ If we transform into this state of mind, then we will perform karma yoga (the yoga of action), using our actions as a means. If we feel bad that we lost everything, we will lose every bit of happiness we have. Sri Krishna tells Arjuna, do not worry about the result of the war which you are about to wage. Be it gain or loss, win or lose. Fighting is your responsibility. If you do it properly, you will attain Swarga. You will get the benefit of following dharma, and you will overcome your sins. You can be free of your sins. Because you will gain from following swadharma (one's own duty), it will give you Swarga. Because of this deed, you will attain Swarga. So, wage this war. Mentioning this, Lord says ana:ryajushtam (ignoble) aswargyam (not leading to heaven). Do not step back. Do your duty and it will become swargyam (leading to heaven).\nThird is aki:rthikaram (bringing disgrace). If you think Swarga is something obtained later in higher worlds… I neither know if it exists, nor if it is open, or if I will even end up going there. Then why should I go through these hardships? I won’t. Arjuna thought that at least people here would think good about him if he does not fight this war. Answering this, Sri Krishna says, “this is aki:rthikaram Arjuna!” It does not earn you fame, even in this world! It will defame you. One who does not fulfill his responsibilities will always be defamed. If you think what happens if I am defamed? Who wants to be defamed? No one wants to be. Even Pandavas did not want to be. Because they wanted to be known for following their elder brother’s words… when Draupadi was being insulted in public, even though they did not like it, they did not interject. Why? Because they were conscious of dharma and respected elders. They feared punya (merit) and papa (sin), results of good and bad actions. Not only that, but they did not want infamy. Because of this, they wanted to be one who stood by their brother’s words… and sat helplessly witnessing the sad event. Although they could easily physically conquer anyone in that assembly, they had to be quiet, folding their hands. Which means they fear papa, results of sinful activities, and are aware of dharma. They believe in swarga and naraka (hell). And they did not want to be defamed.\nSri Krishna tells Arjuna, if you don’t fight in this war, no one will respect you. aki:rthincha:pi bhu:tha:ni kathayishyanthithe: avyaya:m (you will earn disrespect that is too huge to fade). Everyone will think… sambha:vithasyacha aki:rthihi marana:th athirichyathe: (when ten people stab you at once, it feels much worse than death). You may feel it is only the elders who will scold me. I will treat it as a blessing. If elders scold you, it is a blessing. However, these are not trusted, wise elders here. bhaya:dranathuparatham mansinthyethva:m maha:ratha:ha (once upon a time, you thought you were ambidextrous, and could fight people very easily). You thought this, and everyone else also believed that the one who could stop everyone in this manner, was Arjuna. Back in those days, when uththara go:grahana (the incident of the capture of Uththara) was taking place, you alone stood by it and you made all the Kauravas stand by it. That time you earned a good reputation that he is Arjuna, he is savyasachi (ambidextrous) etc., Today, it is not the elders who will decide this, but the useless people because of whom you earned that fame, will say… he is useless, timid, he got scared, he ran away. He bragged so much but once he saw our army and its power, he ran away. That day you encouraged Uththara Kumara in many ways right! That day in uththara go:grahana, you said all these things to him. People will say… ‘Today, when it came to him, see how he turned out. See how he ran away, making him worse than Uththara Kumara.’\nIn reality, defamation and bad words will make a person feel very low. They will degrade the person and push him into grief. They will make the person useless. Society will respect only the one who stays firm on his duties. Those not sticking to their duties will be reprimanded by society. One who has perseverance and constantly works towards his goal… will be praised and respected by society. This is not the case for those lacking these qualities. That is why you will be defamed instead of being praised, if you do not stick to your duty. Saying this, He spoke about the three negative resulting effects. ava:chyava:da:nscha bahu:nvadishyathi (nothing else is more disheartening than this). Saying this, Sri Krishna spoke about the three ill effects. He spoke this in relation to the war, and further related it to how ordinary people like us should apply this in our daily lives. Then, He continued delivering Bhagavad Gita, which we will further discuss. Jai Srimannarayana!"

They will kill me, right!  \nHe replies, “Let it be…  \nhatho:va: pra:psyase: swargam (if you are killed, you will attain heaven), which is also good…  \nor…  \njithwa: va:, if you win,  \nbho:kshyase: mahi:m (you can rule this world).  \nThat is why, awaken and be firm that you have to fight this war.  \nThis is ki:rthikaram (praise-worthy), swargyam (heavenly), and a:ryajushtam (pleasing to the wise).  \nDoing this will please the Wise, a:rya jushtam.  \nYou will attain swarga (heaven), swargyam and...  \nYou will gain praise in the higher worlds, ki:rthikaram.  \nBecause Elders, the Wise, are happy only if one follows sa:sthra (scriptures).  \nBy fighting this war, you are following your dharma (duty) and pleasing the wise.  \nAs we discussed earlier, only those who abide by their duties will attain swarga.  \nAnd not those who do not abide by their duties.  \nEven if it means death while fulfilling your responsibilities, it is a good thing.  \nIt will give you swarga.  \nSo, fight this war.  \nIf you talk about ki:rthi (fame), you are already a renowned one.  \nPa:ndavas have a great reputation that there are no better dharma:thmas (righteous people) than them.  \nBecause you have this good reputation, you should fear getting a bad name.  \nFor example, one who was rich and enjoyed that wealth…  \nwill understand how painful it feels and how hard it is when he loses it.  \nSimilarly, only a renowned person will understand the pain of losing his fame.  \nOnly the one who is in a good position will feel the pain of losing his position.  \nIf he is already in a bad position, how would he know what it means to lose it?  \nWhat is there to tell someone about loss when he does not have a penny to lose?  \nHow will one who does not have a good reputation and name at all,  \nunderstand the fear of being defamed?  \nYou all have good fame.  \nYou are renowned for being greatly righteous during your exile and your rule.  \nNow, you will all become the ones who lose that fame.  \nOne who has [good reputation] is at risk of earning a bad reputation.  \nAnd once it happens, it will degrade the person and may even push him to end his life.  \nThe thought itself, of losing fame makes a reputed person very distressed.  \nHe [Sri Krishna] says, “you have a good reputation, be mindful of not losing it.”  \nWhat would happen if they all criticize me? Let them.  \nIt is alright if great people like Bhi:shma criticize you for not fighting the war.  \nHowever, it is not right when useless people criticize you.  \nIf anyone criticizes you by telling you the truth as is,  \nthen it is meant for your good and such people are your well-wishers.  \nFor example, if you are supposed to study and for some reason, you do not,  \nif one of the elders in the family shouts at you to study…  \nthen that person is your well-wisher because he is trying to teach you what is right.  \nPeople who tell you the truth as is and try to correct you are your well-wishers.  \nHowever, people who blame you for irrelevant things or lure you into unnecessary things…  \n…or backstab you or provoke you and push you to do inappropriate things are dangerous.  \nSuppose a person is a teetotaler,  \nPeer pressure is put on him by friends saying - “what is your life if you do not try this?”  \nEven more, they make logical statements like “you are supposed to try everything,  \nexperience, and know everything…”  \n“You should not become an addict but there is nothing wrong in trying things.  \nYou should experience various things.”  \nThis feels very logical.  \nThe innocent person believing these words to be true, slowly becomes an addict.  \nHis friends make use of him for his money and when it is finished,  \nthey throw him out like waste.  \nPeople around you provoke you to do such things.  \nWhen someone shouts at you to inculcate good habits,  \nit is for your good, and not a bad deed.  \nBut people who force you into bad things are not good.  \nIf something happens to you while fulfilling your responsibilities,  \nhatho:va: pra:psyase: swargam (even if you lose your life while fighting this war),  \nit is for your good and you will attain Swarga.  \nLike I [Sri Krishna] described Swarga earlier, you will get everlasting happiness.  \njithwa: va: bho:kshyase: mahi:m (in case you win this war, you will do good for the world).  \nThat is why you are fighting the war.  \nBecause if they win this, they will ruin the world.  \nWe are witnessing what some or other government is up to presently.  \nIt is aiming to make people lazy and useless.  \nIt does not matter where or which government.  \nPeople are given money for everything like…  \n…for childbirth, death or when a child joins school or when the child leaves the school.  \nThey are paid to purchase food grains without working for it.  \nThey [governments] are coming up with different schemes and making people weak and useless.  \nWhat’s happening? People are becoming good for nothing.  \nEarlier, local people called hamalis would work for various tasks.  \nToday, to accomplish the same tasks, people from other places like Bihar and Odisha should come.  \nOnly if these people finish the work, will there be progress.  \nOnce they leave, the local people are unable to accomplish anything. What’s happening?  \nThey are making people useless and unfit to work.  \nDuryo:dhana had done the same.  \nAfter Pa:ndavas went on exile, he realized that the entire world adored them,  \nHe [Duryo:dhana] wanted to erase that love towards them.  \nHe [Duryo:dhana] wanted to ‘earn’ the fame that Kaurava:s are better rulers.  \nFor this, he planned to give away money to people even if it meant an empty treasure chest.  \nPerhaps getting into debts or losing everything.  \n“Regardless we [Kaurava:s] should ‘earn’ a good name.”  \nThese were the deeds of Duryo:dhana,  \nand the same is described in a beautiful scripture named ‘Kira:ta:rjani:yam’.  \nDuryodhana sent a secret agent like a CID personnel, to see how Pa:ndavas were [in exile].  \nBut the agent was biased towards Pa:ndavas.  \nHe met Pa:ndavas in the forest and told them what king [Duryo:dhana] was up to.  \nHe [agent] mentioned that he [Duryo:dhana] is portraying as if he is doing good  \nto people in various ways, providing amenities…  \nbut in reality, he is making them unfit for work and addicted to [bad habits], degrading them all tremendously.  \nThe agent said, for this reason, you must finish your exile soon and get back to the throne…  \n…and lead people on the right path.  \nWhen was this? In Dwaparayuga. It is Kaliyuga now, 5000 years later.  \nWe are in a much worse situation now. Governments are coming up with many such schemes.  \nGovernments are competing in these schemes.  \nIf one authority gives a 1kg rice at Rs.4.00, another offers the same at Rs.2.00.  \nAnd some others come up with Rs.1 per 1kg.  \nSome other party comes up saying that everything will be provided for free…  \n…like rice, dals (lentils), salt, other groceries, electricity, fuel for cars, and even barbers for ‘free’.  \n“Be lazy and become good for nothing but vote for us.”  \nThe guide for all these is Duryo:dhana.  \nHe showed how to attract people by coming up with these schemes. In reality, he failed to do so.  \nWhatever he tried, people did not believe that it was for their good.  \nDifferent political parties promise that if you vote for them…  \n…they will accomplish anything; they will change how the state looks and many other things like that.  \nThere are at least a few people who think properly and act accordingly.  \nKeep aside who is what these days.  \nMolding people towards duty by recognizing and encouraging their talent, capability, and dedication…  \n…thereby making the state and the country very respectable.  \nThis is what a ruler must do.  \nIf someone acts against this, the well-wishers of the state...  \ncitizens have the responsibility of putting an end to it.  \nYou want good for your people. All the Pa:ndavas wish for the same.  \nTherefore, you must fight this war for the same reason.  \nBy this, you can put an end to unethical rule and utilize the opportunity to start ruling righteously.  \nThat is, in fact, the purpose of your birth.  \nIn the 37th verse, He says:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthasma:d utthishtta kaunthe:ya! \nSLOKA MEANING -\nTherefore, rise up, O Kaunteya (son of Kunti)!\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe [God] gives an example of Queen Kunti saying, “you are the son of Kunti.  \nShe has been through many hardships to bring you all up and to make you what you are today.  \nJust remind yourself of the tough times she has been through.  \nYou are born to such a woman, and you must act accordingly.  \nShe took the responsibility of her children and the children of her co-wife.  \nShe treated them the same and brought them all up together like a family.  \nFor this, Kunti went through many hardships, and you are born to such a great woman.  \nnahisimhi: suthe:na harini:kuma:racharitham a:charithavyam  \nYou are born to a lioness; you should not act like a cat or do crazy deeds like a deer.  \nThe cub of a lioness must behave accordingly.  \nSo, Arjuna!  \nYyuddha:ya kruta nischayaha thasma:d utthishtta  \nRise.  \nSaying this in chapter 2, He encourages Arjuna to fulfill his responsibility by answering his question in 2.37.  \nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Even today, a few great leaders do not forget their original lifestyle. Meaning, their humble beginnings and rule the state and country righteously, benefiting the people. Neither do they become arrogant from the status of their position. Nor do they think about their own personal profit and loss. By living a simple life and abiding by their duties, they work toward developing the nation. Although such people are rulers, they must be called mumukshu (one desiring moksha), or karmayogi (one whose karma becomes a means for the ultimate goal), because their deeds are nishkama (not driven by selfish desire). They do not reap the benefits of their deeds for themselves, be it profit or loss. They believe that these responsibilities are given to them by God and they abide by them. And continue to do good for society.\nHow is such people's karma (activity) like? A common example is used to explain. If there is a drain in which dirty water is flowing - everything looks fine until water flows normally. To clean it, if we poke it with a stick, the dirt accumulated at the bottom gets disturbed, comes to the surface, and smells very bad. To clean this, it must be emptied completely, and water should be forcefully pushed through. This flushes out the waste remnants. In Bhagyanagaram, now Hyderabad, River Musi had a very bad stench. No one could bear the smell while traveling on that road. Once, there was a flood. The water from the flood flushed out the entire dirt and waste and cleared up the river. Now, freshwater flows in that river. This is an example. The same applies to us. Our body, its parts, including manas (mind), heart, have samskara (imprints) of our previous births. They give rise to various feelings. Due to these feelings, we get attracted to various things. We develop feelings like ‘me, mine, and because of me’, degrading us further.\nWhat should be done to erase these samskaras? A massive gush of fresh water with a load of [qualified] material can push out the existing waste material in a stagnant dirty water body and make it clean. Similarly, when all karma (activity) is done with sama drishti (perceiving everything equally), it can gradually erase past karmic imprints and make one nishpapa (free of sins). This is a beautiful process. There’s another similar example we see in common. If there is something recorded on a CD or a pen drive or any such device and we do not like it… We need not destroy it or open it to erase the content on it. All we need to do is insert it into a device that can overwrite it. The old record gets erased automatically and the desired content stays firm in it. We have all experienced this.\nFor millions of our past lives, different parts of the bodies have been used as ‘pen drives’ to store various kinds of records. If we realize this whilst in this body, attune to samadrishti and start working accordingly, even as we fulfill and abide by our responsibilities of this body, i.e. following swadharma (one's own duty), not only will it not pile up new sins, but also just like the heavy pressure of a fresh gush of water with added [qualified] material unclogs existing stagnant waste material, it will gradually clear the karmic records or the samskara accrued over millions of previous lives, cleaning and transforming one’s personality to a sattvic (pure) attitude. This requires sadhana (practice).\nFor this, Sri Krishna explains in verse 2.38 of Bhagavad Gita,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nlaabhalaabhau jayaajayau\nthatho yuddhaaya yujyaswa\nnaivam paapam avapsyasi II\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“You are fighting this war for the sake of duty and neither are you expecting to gain or lose from it nor that someone will praise you. You are doing it because it is your responsibility. This becomes karma nishta (dedication to action) or karma yoga practiced by a mumukshu.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis will be useful to you in all possible ways. This sadhana is necessary. The reason is that old records are very powerful. They affect us without our knowledge. For example, as soon as a calf is born, it can find where its mother yields milk from and positions its mouth there to feed. This is the effect of the previous karma. In the case of humans, someone must show the baby where food is available. But animals do not need such help. We notice that the animals around us get up within minutes of their birth, start walking, and drinking milk. This is the effect of jivanadrishta (life perception). This is the effect of previous karma. To clear its (previous karma) effects, new ones (karma) should be injected. However old they may be and however long they may have resided, everything will be erased. This is God’s mechanism. He explained that ‘in the manifestation created by Him, this is the effect of a human’s bhavana (feelings).’ We must transform our bhavana. It is critical.\nFor this reason, He says “samaukruthwa,” equating them. How can we equate profit and loss or victory and defeat? Because winning is winning, and defeat is defeat. They have their pros and cons. This means that these should not affect your manas (mind). In your manas, you must feel that you have fulfilled your responsibility. If you can think that whatever the outcome is, it does not affect you and reach this detached state of mind, it will give you these desired benefits mentioned. He taught Arjuna through verse 38, that this is the state of bhavana that humans should attain. He also explains the same thing later. Bhavana is transformation of knowledge. Bhavana is also a kind of knowledge. However, this acts as a great fire. In the 4th chapter, He says,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\njnaanaagni sarvakarmaani bhasmasaath kuruthe\nSLOKA MEANING -\nJust like a spark of fire when thrown on dried twigs burns the entire bundle of twigs… if we can inculcate sama drishti (perceiving things equally) in our deeds, that too with an intention of serving God, it will definitely destroy the previous karma.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn verse 2.39, He says,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarmabandham prahaasyasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe unsolicited bond that forms based on our karma…what happens to it? It will be destroyed. It will leave us at once. You will be released - but when? \n-----------------------------------------------\nbuddhya yukto yaya - when your intellect develops sama sthiti (state of equilibrium). What happens then? Karma-bandham will be destroyed. There are a few elements in developing sama buddhi (equanimous intellect), perceiving things equally. Which He described as sankhye buddhihi (intellect of knowledge) and yoge buddhihi (intellect of action). Sankhya means knowledge and yoga means work. Any task must have an underlying intellect. That is, any applied knowledge is supported by intellect. When we must finish a task, we do it only when it is supported by the corresponding knowledge. Because we are initially equipped with knowledge of what it is and how to work on it. Once we know that, it reaches the manas (mind). The mind signals the sense organs which signal external parts of the body and then manifests to a karma (action).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naathma manasa samyujyathe mana indriye:na\nindriyamardye:na, thathaha prathyaksham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBefore we pick up an item, first we think about the item as worth picking up. That thought is called jnana (knowledge). Once we gain jnana, it reaches the mind and signals that this is something we can pick up. From the mind, the signal reaches sense organs and then reaches the external part, hand. Because of the mind’s sankalpa (resolution), the hand reaches out to the object, feels it, and picks it up. This is a beautiful process happening without explicit knowledge of it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere are two things here… one, the knowledge we gained internally and second, the action that took place externally which is kriya (action). This knowledge is supported by some intelligence. Also, the task is performed with the support of some intelligence. He [God] named the underlying support for knowledge as sankhya buddhi. The underlying support for action performed is named as yoga buddhi. \nIf these two exist properly, karmabandham prahaasyasi. The bond that is existent because of the karma of our previous births can be cleared. Saying this, He described sankhya and yoga buddhi. Let us continue to learn about them. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), there are many siddhant (philosophies), like Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Mimamsa, etc. In Bhagavad Gita verse 2.39, Sri Krishna is instructing Arjuna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:shathe::bhi:hitha: sa:nkhye:\nbuddhi:r yo:ge:thu ima:m srunu |\nbuddhya: yuktho: yaya: pa:rttha!\nkarmabandham praha:syasi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"I have told you about Sankhya buddhi (intellect) and Yoga buddhi (intellect related to action). Now, listen to what I have to say about Yoga. With this intellect, you will free yourself from karmic bondage.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nI will tell you about buddhi (intellect), which can free you from karmic bondage. That is Sankhya buddhi and Yoga buddhi. Prior to this, I have explained Sankhya buddhi. Now I will explain Yoga buddhi. He started [the verse] saying this.\nWhen we hear these terms, there is a chance we think He might be talking about Sankhya Shastra (scripture) or Yoga Shastra. However, the second chapter itself of Bhagavad Gita is called Sankhya Yoga. Bhagavad Gita has 18 chapters, right? Every chapter is given a name. They are mostly named as Yoga. Chapter 1 is named Arjuna Vishada Yoga. Chapter 2 is named Sankhya Yoga. Chapter 3 is Karma Yoga, and so on; every chapter is named as a separate type of Yoga.\nThe second chapter is called Sankhya Yoga. We discussed in the beginning what Yoga is. Yoga is not what is commonly being practiced nowadays. Yoga is a means, a way, a path, and a method. Sankhya is a means to elevate oneself. Vishada is a means to elevate oneself. It is a method, path, or means to attain something. He named the path to attain something Yoga. We have discussed this before.\nIn Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna preached 18 Yogas or means for a jiva (soul) to be elevated to a better state. These are primary means. There are a few other avantara sadhanas (secondary means) in them as well. All these are in general called Yoga. Here, the term Yoga is used to indicate ‘means’. Every word has a specific meaning. If we can understand its meaning properly, we won’t be in trouble. We will be in trouble if we try to fit the meaning we know to that word.\nIf we have a small cap and we try to fit our head in, it won’t work. If we bring a big cap and try to fit our head in it, we must add another layer like a turban or something to fit it in. However, if we can carefully understand the meaning of the word in that context, then we will be fine. Bhagavad Gita is called Yoga Shastra. It is a scripture that elaborates on sadhanas (means). They are also called upayas (means). Since it gives upayas, it is called Yoga Shastra.\nWhen naming the chapters, the term Yoga was used in that sense. However, in verse 2.39, Sri Krishna instructs Arjuna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:shathe::bhi:hitha sa:nkhye:\nbuddhi:r yo:ge:thu ima:m srunu |\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"I have told you about Sankhya buddhi and Yoga buddhi. Now, listen to what I have to say about Yoga.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nHere, the meaning of Yoga is different. It is different from the meaning in chapter names. The term Yoga is used in many contexts to mean different things. Generally, our people speak of Yoga day, Yoga abhyasa (practice), etc. The practice done for good health is called Yoga here. Some people make it a little more specific and call it Hatha Yoga or some other Yoga. All these belong to Yoga in that context. Sri Krishna is not using it here in that context.\nThen how is He using it here? He calls the activity we do Yoga. However, He is not calling any activity Yoga. He calls Nishkama Karma (selfless action), activity without selfish desire, Yoga. That is, if you reform the activity you are doing with a samskara (qualification), it is called Yoga. A mango, if qualified in a certain way, is called avakaya (mango pickle). For it to be called ‘avakaya’, it has to go through different processes.\nWhatever regular activities we do, if qualified in a certain way, become Nishkama Karma or Karma Yoga. If you hear Nishkama Karma or Karma Yoga, it feels like a very heavy, profound term. However, if we refer to it as ‘work done without expectation of result,’ it feels simple. We get many questions about that also. If we hear Nishkama Karma or Karma Yoga, we won’t understand what to question and hence keep quiet. However, if one says, ‘work done without expecting any result,’ we ask who will work without expecting a result?\nThere is no use in just working - is it a vaccine or what? We don’t know what’s the use of it, but everyone has to take it [vaccine]. Our folks are saying that, right? Why do we need to take the vaccine? Don’t know. What does it do? Don’t know. Does it help? Don’t know. Ok then, no need to take it. No, you have to take it. Whatever virus the vaccine is manufactured for, that virus is gone now. It has mutated into many variants and is amongst us in a new form. It may not work on this [virus], but you should take it.\nWhy should you take it? Don’t know. You should take the vaccine; otherwise, you won’t be allowed to travel by flight. If you don’t take the vaccine, you can’t travel or go out in public. You can’t do other things without a vaccination card. Hence, one takes it. Is this Karma Yoga like that? Yoga is work done without [expecting] a result. It’s not work that has no result. There will be some result; however, when you do not expect any result, it is called Yoga. That is also called Nishkama Karma.\nIf you do the work as an offering to God, it is called Karma Yoga. Sri Krishna is preaching to Arjuna, “So far, I have taught you about buddhi (knowledge) named Sankhya,”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:shathe::bhi:hitha sa:nkhye:\nbuddhi:r yo:ge:thu ima:m srunu |\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"I have told you about Sankhya buddhi and Yoga buddhi. Now, listen to what I have to say about Yoga.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nPrior to this, He spoke about the underlying buddhi of Sankhya. What did He say until now? He spoke about deha-atma viveka (the difference between body and soul), which is called Sankhya. Bhagavad Gita chapter 2 is called Sankhya Yoga, right? Sankhya is a means. Sankhya is to have the knowledge of Atma Tattva (truth of the soul) for one to be elevated to a better state. In the 18 means, this is the second means.\nIsn’t there Sankhya Darsana (philosophy), a philosophy propagated by Sage Kapila? In that, it is said ‘prakruthi karthri’ (nature as the doer). In that, it is said, purusha (soul) is in a neutral state and there is nothing else beyond that. That is Sankhya philosophy or Sankhya Darsana. But here, He is not talking about that. This is an aspect of buddhi. What is that aspect of buddhi? \nsamyak khya:yathe: ithi sankhya:\nsamyak khya:yathe:\nthe decisive intelligence on a topic is Sankhya or Sankhya: What is buddhi? First, we should know if we possess it or not. \nsa:sthra nishpa:dhya:ya nirnayaha buddhihi\nWhatever has been decided by the scriptures regarding what ought to be done, what ought to be left, what is duty, what is tyajyam (to be sacrificed), what needs to be known and what need not be. Whatever has been decided regarding those, that decision is buddhi (wisdom). \nsa:shtra nishpa:dhya: nirnayam - (what is decided by scriptures) is buddhi. This buddhi is referred to as Sankhya. Why? Because it gives clear decisions about everything. It gives clarity of what something is. That buddhi which decides on that clarity is called Sankhya. What needs to be understood with such buddhi is called Sankhya. That knowledge is Atma Tattva, knowledge of the soul.\nWe can’t understand it with indriyas (senses), nor can we understand it with inference. Atma Tattva can only be understood by scriptures. Whatever decides and gives Atma Tattva is called Sankhya. The one which bestows swarupa jnana (knowledge of inherent nature of self) is Sankhya. Since Bhagavad Gita chapter 2 instructs on how to use that Atma Tattva jnana as a means, the chapter is named Sankhya Yoga.\nOur people refer to jnana (knowledge) with different names when it changes. Like mathihi (intellect), medha (intelligence), prajna (wisdom), and dharanavathi medhahi (deep intelligence). If the jnana is such that we memorize it after hearing it only once, it is called medha. If it is clear to us all the time, it is called thrikaaliki matha prajna (wisdom that is clear at all times). That jnana is called prajna. If it can predict what will happen in the future, that is called mathihi. It is called agami gochara (knowledge of future events).\nNigantu (dictionary) gives buddhihi mathischa medha sankhya samviddhii upalabdhi… these are names for jnana (knowledge). However, amongst these, if that buddhi helps us understand Atma Tattva jnana clearly, it is called Sankhya. Until now, I have explained to you how to prepare that buddhi with an equanimous mind. Keeping this as the foundation, start your work.\nFor us, tenth class is a foundation. After that, you can take science, economics, history, commerce, etc. This is called foundation. If the foundation is strong, you can construct the building properly. If the Sankhya buddhi which decides the Atma Tattva jnana is firm, then our activities will be good - that work is called Yoga. I will tell you how the buddhi, which can transform your work into Yoga, should be. \nIn verse 2.39, yo:ge buddhihi - what is it and what does it do?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyaya: pa:rtha karma bandham praha:syasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n\"It qualifies all the activities you do, without adding new karmas, and getting rid of old karmas.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt qualifies all the activities you do, without adding new karmas, and getting rid of old karmas. Whatever qualifies your activities, I will tell you about that now. Thus, Sri Krishna started preaching about Karma Yoga and is continuing further gradually. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2 - We are now at sloka 40. God is very compassionate. He is also a great acharya (teacher). Whether Arjuna liked it or not, Sri Krishna is an acharya with a will to ensure Arjuna recognizes his duties by sharing well-wishing thoughts with him. Keeping Arjuna as a means, the Lord intended to preach to the entire human race about devotion to one’s duty. The Lord is Jagadacharya (guru to the entire world).\nNormally, we don’t feel like doing work until we know the resulting benefit. If we know there will be a specific benefit for doing something, then we are certainly ready to do it… if we like the benefit. Otherwise, if we are told to work without any benefit, then we don’t feel like doing it… even if it is our responsibility.\nLet’s say someone who is working in an office has a job of sanctioning the plans. We took a plan to him, he looked at it and everything seemed to be fine. He needs to sign and stamp it. However, he won’t stamp and sign anything without a bribe for each service. Otherwise, the work doesn’t get completed. In fact, he was given a job specifically for sanctioning plans. His duty is to do that job. Although it is his duty, he needs a temporary benefit. Otherwise, how will it move forward? He expects a temporary benefit for that work. If we don’t give him that, then he ruins that work. Meaning, he will do whatever needed to ensure it doesn’t get sanctioned for a day, month, or even a year. \nBenefit! Forget about long-term benefit, unless we get short-term benefit, we don’t feel like working. This is a natural weakness of humans. That’s why in this 2nd chapter, Sri Krishna says to Arjuna, “Whatever you must do…” “Your duty must be executed without expecting any temporary benefits.” “You should wage war. While in the war, you will feel sorrow and happiness.” “You will feel soft and firm.” “You shouldn’t pay attention to such things. You need to possess samathva buddhi (intellect with equanimity).” He named it yoga (the path of action). He said he was going to elaborate on this yoga.\nHe [Arjuna] asked how it would benefit him if he learned about this process. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarma bandham praha:syasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“You will be free from all sorrows and hurdles resulting from your past karma if you do it this way.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna might think, “I can’t perceive any of this benefit, what do I do with it?” To make sure Arjuna doesn’t think this way, like a good acharya, who creates enthusiasm and curiosity… and provides knowledge to his disciple, even though the disciple has no interest in knowing, he [acharya] teaches the lesson playfully in an enjoyable manner. He makes the lesson fun and interesting, motivating the disciple for inquisitive questions. Sri Krishna also teaches Arjuna similarly.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nne:ha:bhi: krama na:so:sthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“There is no loss if you initiate this effort.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe infuses wonderful motivation. Once upon a time, there was a great king named Janamejaya. A Guru named Vysampayana approached the king. He [Guru] said, “I want to tell you the history of your elders.” The king said, “What is it called?” The guru said, “Mahabharata.” King said, “That’s great. How long does it take?” Guru said, “Each sloka (verse) may take about half an hour.” King said, “How many slokas are there?” Guru said, “There are 125,000 slokas.” King replied, “There are 125,000 slokas and each one takes half an hour? Wow! I don’t have time. I will be back.” Guru said, “What about me? I came to tell you this. Listen!” King said, “I can’t spare the time…” Guru said, “At least tell me when you can listen.” King said, “I can consider after one month if I am available.”\nThe guru returned exactly after a month. The king was afraid at the sight of the Guru, concerned about the time that he might demand for the lesson. The king wasn’t willing to give any time for an appointment. Somehow, the Guru was able to get an appointment with great difficulty. Guru said, “I want to tell you about your elders, only them, no one else. What your grandfather has done, what your great grandfather has done, what their grandfather did. Learn about your elders… It’s for your own good.” King said, “Oh no! I don’t have so much time.” Guru said, “How much time can you spare?” King said, “Tell me how concisely you can explain it?” Guru said, “Okay, no need to hear 125,000 slokas. Can you listen to at least 1,000 slokas?” King said, “That’s difficult. 1,000 slokas is 500 hours, which is difficult.” Guru said, “Can you listen to 100 slokas?” King said, “That is also difficult, sir.” Guru said, “Can you listen to 10 slokas?” King said, “10 slokas, half an hour each means I need to sit for 5 hours. That is also difficult, sir.” Guru said, “Tell me how much time you can spare?” King said, “It would be great if you can complete this in 15 minutes…?” Guru said, “Wow. I want to tell you about your own elders for your own benefit and you can only spare 15 minutes?” “I don’t even need 15 minutes. I just need half a minute. That’s all.”\nKing said, “Thank you so much. I will double the payment for this. Please tell me quickly.” \nGuru said, \ndvao mo:dha purushou loke:smin\n“In this world, there are only two ‘great fools’. I came here to tell you about them. I am leaving now.” \nKing said, “What are their names? Where do they live? What do they do?” “How can you leave like that without telling me anything?” Guru said, “You don’t have time, right?” King said, “That’s true, but I need to at least know their names. In case they come to me, I need to know.” Guru said, “You want me to tell you? Do you have time?” King said, “Just tell me that and that’s enough.” Guru said, “Duryodhana, Dasa:ananu.” “One is named Duryodhana and the other is named Dasa Kanththa. I am leaving now.” King said, “Please wait, sir. What’s the rush? Please tell me where they live. I see fools everywhere in the world. Why did you specify only these two? How did you identify these two?” Guru said, “You want me to tell you? You don’t have time, right?” King said, “Just answer that one question. I will squeeze some time here and there.” \nGuru said, \ngo:graham vanabhangam cha dhrushtva: yudhdham muhurmuhuhu\n“One person witnessed go:grahanam (cattle capture), yet waged war. Another witnessed vanabhangam (forest destruction), yet waged war. That’s why they are considered great fools.” \nKing said, “What does that mean - waging war after witnessing go:grahanam? What is go:grahanam?” Guru said, “You don’t have time, right?” King said, “Please tell me, sir! What is go:grahanam?” Guru said, “Go:grahanam means capturing cattle.” King said, “Where did they take them from, sir?” Guru said, “They were taken from the north side, right!” King said, “From which town, sir?” Guru said, “In Viratnagar.” King said, “Who, sir?” Guru said, “Arjuna, etc. came and took them.” King said, “Why did they take them, sir?” Guru said, “Kauravas came there. That’s why.” King said, “Why did Kauravas come there, sir?” Guru said, “To expose their ajnathavasam (incognito exile).” King said, “Why did they perform ajnathavasam, sir?” Guru said, “After their 12 years of aranyavasam (forest exile), only then they did ajnathavasam.” King said, “Oh, they did 12 years of aranyavasam? Why did they do that?” Guru said, “After the match, according to the wager, they had to go to the forest.” King said, “What games did they play?” Guru said, “They gambled - maya judam (a game of dice).” King said, “Maya judam? Why did they play?” Guru said, “Sakuni, etc. made them play.” King said, “Why?”\nIn this manner, the great Guru made the King ask questions, provoking further inquisitiveness… and recited the entire history of Bharata. The one who could only spare half a minute was able to spend his entire life listening to that. The Guru converted him in such a way and preached to him clearly what he was supposed to know. He is a perfect Guru. He is Vysampayana Maharshi. He said all this and explained the entire Bharatham.\nGuru said, “Go:graham vanabhangam cha.” “That’s why Duryodhana witnessed go:graham and became a fool.” King said, “There is a second one, right? Who is that?” “He witnessed vanabhangam and became a fool. Who is that?” Guru said, “He is Dasanana, referring to Ravana.” King said, “Why did vanabhangam happen to him?” Guru said, “Because Hanuman burned down and ruined the entire forest.” King said, “What was the reason behind Hanuman burning the forest?” Guru said, “That’s what he needed to do after his tail was lit on fire.” King said, “Who lit Hanuman’s tail?” Guru said, “Ravana lit it.” King said, “Why did he set it on fire?” Guru said, “Hanuman advised him for his welfare. Ravana didn’t care for it, got angry, and lit the tail.” King said, “Why did he [Hanuman] have to advise Ravana?” Guru said, “Because Ravana kidnapped Sita, and it was necessary to advise Ravana.” King said, “Why did Ravana take Sita? Where did he keep her?” Guru said, “He kept her in Lanka.” King said, “Where did he bring her from, placing her captive in Lanka?” Guru said, “He brought her from Panchavati.” King said, “Why was Sita in Panchavati?” Guru said, “During their [Rama, Sita, Lakshmana] vanavasam (forest exile), that’s where they reached.” King said, “How did they get there?” Guru said, “After 12 years of travel, they built a small house there.” King said, “Wow, 12 years! How many years did they stay there?” Guru said, “They stayed for [total] 14 years.” King said, “Why 14 years?” Guru said, “Because Kaikeyi wished for it.” King said, “Why did she wish for it?” Guru said, “To give the kingdom to Bharata.”\nLike this, the Guru explained the entire Ramayana. The great king who claimed that he didn’t have any time for the guru… that guru taught Sri Ramayana, which has 24,000 slokas, and Mahabharata, which has 125,000 slokas. The guru made it possible for the king to listen to both. He is the one who is a good Guru. What did he do? He made the selected person curious about the content, provoked inquisitive questions, and in turn, answered them. This is what a good Guru does. Sri Krishna is Jagath Guru (Universal Guru). He is the ideal for all Gurus.\nArjuna was in a quandary, whether to wage war or not, and impatient - wanting to simply hear something quickly and leave. He [Sri Krishna] provoked curiosity within him and preached wonderfully in detail… all there is to know about atma (soul) tatva (truth). What is the body, what is atma, what the characteristics of the body are, what the characteristics of atma are… and why we need to know about these. We need to work with the body. We need to have the knowledge of atma. How should we have the knowledge? How should we do the work with the body? What is the relationship between both? The supporting nischaya-aatmika jnana (decisive knowledge) is called buddhi (intellect). If this is towards atma, it is called sankhya (knowledge). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsa:nkhye: budhihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“If it is towards work, it is called yoga (the path of action).”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhy do we need to know about this? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarma bandham praha:syasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“To destroy the shackles of karma.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat happens if we don’t know about this? Let’s say I am able to realize the knowledge about these topics but I die before I attain the result. What is the use? All the knowledge will be lost in vain. Anticipating that Arjuna might say this, Sri Krishna preaches the benefit upfront. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nne:ha:bhi: krama na:so:sthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“There is no loss if you initiate this effort.”\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprathyava:yo: na vidyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Even if you don’t learn about this holistically, there is no loss or harm.”\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvalpam apyasya dharmasya\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“No matter how little you know about this.”\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthra:yathe: mahatho: bhaya:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Liberates us from ahankara (arrogance) that has intense negative effect.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis jnana (knowledge) [liberates us] - if we know about this buddhi! I will tell you about this, listen! Sri Krishna thus motivated Arjuna and preached a wonderful sloka. This 40th sloka is worth remembering for all of us. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Normally, we all are opportunists. This means that if there is any opportunity for us to reap a benefit, we feel like making the most of it. If there is no benefit for us, then we feel like escaping. For everything, we expect a benefit. For every work we perform, we will certainly always receive a result. If it is a good activity, we reap good results. If it is a bad activity, we reap a bad result. There is never a case where there is no result to any work performed. Whether we want it or not, there are hundreds, thousands, and lakhs of activities being performed in our body every second. How do we carry out these activities in the correct manner? What are the few good activities which when performed maximize benefit? We must be taught about this. It should not be in such a way that you are physically toiling away with only minimum benefit. Even with minimum effort, we should reap good results. They should be permanent and profitable. If that’s the case, then we become committed to performing the work. \nSri Krishna clarifies that what He preaches in verse 2.40 is going to yield us such profit.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nne:ha:bhi:krama na:so:sthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere is no loss of effort here.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen we discover something new for the first time, it is called upajnam (acquisition of knowledge). Based on that newly acquired knowledge, if we begin work, it is called upakrama (initiation of work). If we execute the work properly, progressing it forward, it is called abhikrama (progress in work). Upakrama or abhikrama have nearly the same meaning. If we begin the activity, make some progress, and then due to our inability, it stops… Certain activities result in a loss, some result in destruction, and others yield no profit. However, the upade:sa (teaching) given by Sri Krishna gives us benefits equivalent to the effort.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nabhikrama na:saha na:sthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAfter beginning [the effort], even if you quit in the middle, there is no loss.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAssume there is a spring which needs to be stretched from one end and hooked to another end. If you stretch it all the way and stop, it reverts back to the starting position. So, all the effort made so far was in vain. If you pull it to anywhere in the middle, it is still in vain. It is successful only if hooked at the end. \nA:njane:ya Swamy (Hanuman) listened to all the previous lamentations of other monkeys. However, he didn’t say a word until Ja:mbavan spoke. The other monkeys said, “I can cross 10 yo:jana:s (a unit of distance) in this ocean, but not sure after that.” It is an ocean of 100 yo:janas. If someone is capable of only jumping 10 yo:jana:s, he will simply fall into the ocean. Someone else can jump 50, another 70, another 80, another 90, another 99. Whether someone crosses 1 yo:jana or 99 yo:jana:s, it’s the same result. What is it? Falling into the ocean and drowning. When is it considered successful? It’s successful only after having crossed 99 yo:jana:s, one crosses the 100th yo:jana ultimately reaching Lanka (the kingdom of Ravana). What’s the benefit even after reaching Lanka? The work still needs to be accomplished. After reaching, if one gets tired and sleeps, then people there will simply devour him like a snack. Just reaching there is not important. Getting the work done is important. Just getting the work done is not paramount. Returning home is also important. Only after these steps, whatever abhikrama he has done is considered successful. Otherwise, that abhikrama gets nullified. It becomes abhikrama na:saha (loss of progress). It shouldn’t happen like that, right?\nLet’s say that we want to learn about God or we want to learn about karma yo:ga (the yoga of action). First of all, we learned about sa:nkya (the philosophy of knowledge). Then we are interested in learning about yo:ga. Let’s say we started learning about this yo:ga and we die, or something happened to our Guru, or there was a hurdle for completing the lesson, or time was not enough or maybe everything was halted because of COVID. Then what happens? All the effort we spent goes in vain, right? Arjuna’s question is why should we even bother putting in the effort? Why should we even put in that much effort? We can just sit idle, right? \nMy boy, even that effort is not going to go in vain. The benefit you reap will be equivalent to the amount of effort you put in. This needs to be conveyed to Arjuna. There are some types of work where if you don’t complete, then you will face negative consequences. With certain yajna:s (sacrifices) and ya:ga:s (rituals), if the manthra:s (sacred chants) are not chanted correctly, or incorrect material has been used, or one didn’t perform the activity correctly, or if there are mistakes in the pronunciation of the manthras… forget about achieving a positive result, there will be negative consequences and the doer will face trouble. \nOnce Indra performed a ya:ga, where instead of killing Indra’s enemy, Indra himself was about to be killed. So, there will be negative consequences like this. We can also recall the story of Vruthra:sura (the demon). Vruthra:sura performed penance where he wished for the birth of Indra’s enemy. However, because of incorrect pronunciation, although someone was born, he was not born as Indra’s enemy. Instead, he was born as someone who would kill Indra’s enemy, Vruthra:sura. This is a historic story mentioned in the Ve:da (sacred texts). Manthras give negative consequences when pronounced incorrectly. The same goes if the activities or material used is flawed. If something is incorrect, it is known as prathyava:ya (negative consequence). \nIn our history, we hear many such stories. Someone became a bramha ra:kshasi (a type of demon), a monster, for not performing ya:ga properly. In Ra:ma:nuja’s life story, Ya:davapraka:sa visited a princess who was possessed by a ra:kshasa (demon). The demon told Ya:davapraka:sa, “You don’t know who you are. You don’t know who I am, what can you do? Go, get your disciple Ra:ma:nuja.” Ya:davapraka:sa asks, “Who are you?” The ra:kshasa says, “I am a wonderful scholar who learned all the four ve:da:s. I used to perform nithya agnihothram (daily fire offerings) to the Lord via ho:ma kunda (sacred fire pit). However, because of errors in some of my rituals, I have become a monster. You don’t know who I am, and you want to chase me away! You don’t know who you are, and you are here to chase me away! How do we make you leave?” The ra:kshasa says, “Bring your disciple Ra:ma:nuja. If his feet touch me, I will leave.” \nIf the activities are done out of sequence, then prathyava:yam will occur. In the scripture written by Krishna D:va Ra:yalu called a:muktha ma:lyadha, there is someone named Ma:la da:sari. He was resting under a tree on his way toward Thirukkurungudi. There was a bramha ra:kshasi on the tree who came to eat him. Upon his return, that bramha ra:kshasi says, “I am an accomplished Ve:dicscholar, well-versed in all the four Ve:da:s. Because of mistakes in some of my activities during ya:ga, I have become a monster. Because I have talked to you, a great devotee, my faults are being eliminated and I am being elevated.” This is written by Krishna D:va Ra:yalu. Thus, there is a possibility for prathyava:yam to occur. \n“Sri Krishna, if there are mistakes committed while conducting your activities… and in addition, we don’t know how long they will take, or how long I will live, or how long I will be able to perform, nor how long this body supports me... Henceforth, why such headaches? We can comfortably avoid performing activities or hear anything.” So, considering all that, tell me exactly what to do or I might as well just go and beg for alms,” says Arjuna. \nSri Krishna answers, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nne:ha:bhi: krama na:so:sthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOnce begun, as much effort as you put in, you will reap the equivalent benefit.\n-----------------------------------------------\n[Arjuna says] “What if it is stopped halfway or what if the work is completed but the result has not yet materialized?” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprathyava:yo: na vidyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis doesn’t result in any negative consequences.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis knowledge which I am giving to you right now. [Arjuna says] “But I have put in minimal effort. What result do I get? Isn’t it wasted?” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsvalpam apyasya dharmasya thra:yathe: mahatho: bhaya:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll the activities which you perform, no matter how small or big, as much as you have accomplished, you will reap the benefit of that amount of effort.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn the case of a spring, unless you have hooked it to the other end, there is no result. However, let’s say you need to travel one kilometer. You have taken 10 steps and you get tired. You have collapsed. The distance you traveled thus far is not wasted, right? When you want to continue, you will start from the 11th step. Let’s say you have traveled half a kilometer, lost your stamina, it got dark, and slept there itself. Will the half a kilometer distance you traveled go waste? No. When you restart your journey, you will only have half a kilometer to travel. Whatever you have already walked is neither wasted nor will you face any negative consequences. You also receive a benefit [of having traveled halfway]. For example, however much someone works, he will earn that much compensation. Additionally, the effort you have put in now will ease the path for future effort. Hence it is thra:yathe:, mahatho: bhaya:th (it will eliminate potential future flaws and reveal a good path). \nThus, Sri Krishna is motivating well. That’s why we call him a great a:charya (teacher). In general, a:cha:rya:s believe that since the Guru has given them this knowledge, they must pass it on to others, otherwise they would be committing an injustice to their own Guru. \nAnilji - can you fix this? Let’s combine these two please? There is a rule in Ve:da - \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npraya:thanthum ma: vyavachchye:thsi:hi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe Wise have given to you. After that, you need to share with others.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey [Elders] recommend choosing a capable person. So just search for someone and spread the upade:sa (teaching) because it’s necessary! There is another type of Guru. Since a person is asking them so many times and might feel bad if not given, and unable to stand his difficulties, they share [the knowledge]. There is another type, where the other person is incapable of asking. Yet pitying his miserable situation, they [Gurus] teach. Another type of Guru shares even when seekers don’t ask. Once that knowledge is with the Guru, he cannot restrain himself from sharing it. Like cows who are unable to stop themselves from giving the milk to their calves. Gurus are unable to not share their knowledge with others. They create some kind of curiosity in the other person and enlighten them. These are very generous a:charya:s. These are called krupa: ma:thra prasanna acha:ryas (teachers who are merciful). There is no other reason [for their mercy]. The recipient’s difficulty is not the reason, his asking is not the reason. It’s not because their own Gurus have instructed them to do so. How can he survive without sharing the wisdom he possesses with other people? \nji:rnamange: subha:sitam (old wisdom) This [wisdom] cannot end within him. It certainly needs to be given to someone or the other. “Sonna:l viro:damidu a:hilum solluvan ke:nmin”, says the great Namma:lawar (a saint). If I say it, you may not like it. You may face inconvenience. Nevertheless, I will surely tell you and you should surely listen. Thus, forcibly they give the knowledge for the benefit of the people. Similarly, Sri Krishna also preaches to Arjuna since this is for Arjuna’s benefit. As this is needed for humanity, which is in a similar situation as Arjuna… this knowledge is required for everyone who needs to follow their duty, the buddhi (intellect) which needs to be applied to yo:ga, the means to attain a goal, by performing nishka:ma karma (selfless action) - activities not driven by selfish desires. Since this is required by everyone, and everyone has a responsibility to know this… whether they ask or not, whether they are aware of it or not, because He knows about it, driven by the urge to share, out of profound kindness, Lord is preaching Bhagavad Gita verse 2.41.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "episode": 95,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), a good a:cha:rya (teacher), guru, always encourages his students as they make efforts. Even if one accomplishes a simple task, the Guru reinforces the student to encourage him for greater achievements. This is the characteristic of a sada:cha:rya (good guru). \nEven if you do a good deed, some people might criticize you, claiming, “What do you know? What did you do?” This is referred to as salya sa:radhyam, ‘charioting’ by Salya. Even if talented, if under the care of those who don’t know how to recognize and encourage talent, it is of no use. We know about Karna in Mahabharata. Though Karna was very capable, he was very discouraged by his charioteer Salya’s words. There are a few parents and gurus who are also like that. Instead of encouraging their little ones, they criticize and antagonize them, causing a tampered mental ability. They [children] carry on mechanically. However, they lack enthusiasm and happiness.\nFor all such people, Sri Krishna is a role model, teaching the right method. Always encourage those who depend on us, even if they accomplish a small amount. Sometimes, they desire to do a task but are unable to do it. However, if you inspire them and help them believe it’s possible, they can do it; they will definitely put in efforts and might achieve it as well. \nHH words in English: That motivation and encouragement is very, very necessary. Sri Krishna gives Arjuna such wonderful motivation in the second chapter.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nne:ha:bhikrama na:so:sthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Here, no effort is ever wasted.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou can do little, that is enough. Don’t worry that you are not doing enough. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprathyava:yo na vidhyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“If I don't do it properly, the work could get messed up and others may accuse me.”\n-----------------------------------------------\n“I may be disgraced. Others may say I didn’t do it properly; I may be embarrassed.” You may fail at it once, that’s fine. Try again. Students write exams. Previously, if we scored 60%, we would be elated, on cloud nine. If anyone scored 60%, he passed in the first division and would be considered a genius. However, nowadays, even if he scores 99%, he gets depressed because his neighbor secured 99.1%. His neighbor is also depressed as his neighbor got 99.2%. He [neighbor] is also depressed because there is another one who secured 99.9%. \nPeople have no satisfaction because of an increasingly encouraged competitive attitude. Because of this competitive attitude, the goal has changed to securing maximum marks. It is no longer enhancing one’s understanding of the actual essence. Earlier, even if one scored 60%, he had good command of the subject. He would be a properly qualified individual. However, there is no quality in the individual now though he has high marks and great certificates. We are witnessing this. We shouldn’t encourage someone in that direction; instead, encourage him to grasp the essence. This is what Sri Krishna did.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprathyava:yo na vidhyathe\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“It is fine if you couldn’t do it, no worries.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf you don’t get the expected marks, what is the need to get depressed and contemplate suicide? Try again. Even then if you can’t succeed, try one more time. When you have a life of 100 years, what happens if you lose one year [of studies]? There is no loss. One can think that way, right? Society should encourage everyone to think that way. Why should he be made to feel that his life is finished and there is nothing left? Sri Krishna is an excellent teacher in this aspect.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprathyava:yo na vidhyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“If you attempt something and fail somewhere in between, that’s fine. You can try again.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou now have the experience in it; it will become the foundation for your next attempt. Recently, our people launched a rocket to the moon. It went to the moon and was about to land. Suddenly, it tumbled on the moon and became useless. The staff working on that project felt dejected. The Prime Minister had gone there to watch [the rocket launch]. He sat them down and encouraged them saying, “Don’t worry. You did good so far. Let's try again. You did many great things before. We achieved so much. It is fine if this didn’t go well. You can do well next time.” \nIf one takes this approach, they will be able to accomplish future targets with renewed enthusiasm. This encouraging mindset is essential. Sri Krishna has this amazing quality. Hence, He is encouraging Arjuna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nne:habhikrama na:so:sthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Here, no effort is ever wasted.”\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nswalpamapyasya dharmasya\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“If your target is 50 but you could only do 5. That is fine too. You have done good so far.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou can achieve it in the next attempt. You will become capable enough to achieve the remaining 45. He is encouraging Arjuna this way. If you can do this, thra:yathe mahatho: bhaya:th…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthra:yathe mahatho: bhaya:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“With the effect of your wonderful efforts, you can free yourself from karmic bondage happily.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe gives the same kind of motivation not once, but again in chapter 6.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npa:rttha naive:ha na muthra vina:sas thasya vidyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Once you start the activity, whatever you do is enough.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat you do will never go in vain.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna hi kalyanakruth kaschith durgathim tha:tha! gachhathi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Indeed, no one who does good will ever fall into a bad situation.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nSuch a beautiful expression! “tha:tha” i.e., little one. If one simply thinks of doing a good deed, he will never be degraded. Just the thought is enough, it seems. Not holding at just the thought, but if he acts on it, speaks to others about it, and motivates them to take action, then he must be even greater. \nSri Krishna is speaking of the one who took the first step - inculcating thought. If someone simply thinks of doing good, durgathim na gachhathi, he will never experience bad outcomes. Wonderful encouragement! This is one of the best supports that the Lord is giving. He declared in chapter 6 that such a person will never be degraded. Here [in chapter 2], He says, ‘thra:yathe mahatho: bhaya:th’.\nWhat is bhaya (fear) for this ji:va (soul)? Karma bandha (karmic bondage) is the biggest fear. The sorrows resulting from karma bandha are the cause of fear. We are afraid of the de:ha parampara (succession of bodies), resulting from karma bandha. We are in this human body now. When we leave this body for some reason, we don’t know what body is next. There is no guarantee on the type of body we will get next. We don’t even know if there is a next body. \nIt is said that there is a next body, so we believe it. However, we don’t know if we get a better or a worse body - maybe that of an insect or bacteria. We don’t know which realms we will be taken to or where we will go. However, what would we desire? Some people say that few souls roam around in the ether unable to get any type of body. We haven’t seen such things, but it is said so. It seems they wait for an opportunity. \nIt is stated in some scriptures that sometimes a soul leaves its previous body, staying in the subtle body, has karmas to experience but has not gotten a new body yet. What will he do in this time period? He will be roaming around without a gross body, not able to do anything. He doesn’t do things like those portrayed in movies. He roams around in pain. He looks for somebody with similar ‘tuning’ and tries to latch on there. He tries to experience things through that other person. It seems these things happen. This is one such state. \nOne is unnatha dasa (higher state), the other is adho: dasa (lower state), and the last is madhya dasa (intermediate state). In these various states, we don't know where we are destined for. It is based on karma bandha. We should free ourselves from this state. We should get to a state where we don’t get such miserable bodies again. Sri Krishna is assuring us that we will attain that state. \nPrimarily, we will lose the fear of samsara (the cycle of birth and death). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthra:ya:the mahatho: bhaya:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“He will get out of the fear of samsara.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is the fear about? What is samsara? We usually think samsara means our body, relatives, job, business, income, expenses. No! This is not samsara. The bha:va (feelings) we have towards them is samsara. In fact, the soul and body are different, right? We got the body as an instrument. Whatever states the body [instrument] is going through is because of his attachment to the body; he thinks of it as his, for him, and because of him. \nMan thinks aham (I) is that [the body], which is not actually the ‘I’. Such feelings are ahambha:vas (egoistic feelings). The reason is ahamka:ra (misconception that he is the body). This is samsara. He needs to be freed from this. In this world, all objects are good. However, the feeling one has that they belong to him, that bha:vana (feeling of attachment) is bad. \nTo be freed from samsara is to be freed from the grip of this feeling. How will he be freed? He should realize all these are separate from him. He should realize they pertain to the instrument [body] which he obtained. Someone gave us this body and we are experiencing karmas, records of good and bad; someone gave us instruments for it, that someone is God. Hence, if we do them [karmas] as an offering to God, these actions will free us. \nWe can be freed from them, but we are unable to do that now. We are hanging onto these; hence they increasingly degrade us. Actually, these are not ours. Our body doesn’t work according to our command. We do not have experiences that are as per our wish. If so, if we wanted to fly to the sky, it would be possible. That’s not happening, right? Hence the instrument, i.e., body is not ours. Experiences pertaining to the body are not ours. The experiences are unsolicited. Someone behind the scenes is giving them. \nRecognize this and leave the experiences to the understanding that they are meant for experiencing karma, and the way to free oneself from bonding with it [further] is to experience them [without entanglement]. Otherwise, one will be tied up in more bondage in addition to existing ones. This is caused by ahamka:ra, known as samsara. Aham (I) is good. It belongs to God. For it to belong to God, it should become daso:ham (subservient). Daso:ham is good, but if it is ahamka:ra, it is dangerous. \nWe will be freed from ahamka:ra if we learn about karma yoga (the path of selfless action). Thus, the Lord explains karma a:charana (doing actions) backed with the knowledge of a:thma thaththva jna:na (reality of the soul). He now begins teaching about working with an equanimous mind and without expecting results. This begins with the term vyava:sa:ya:thmika buddhi in verse 2.41. Let’s learn about it! Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita clarifies how a man must channel his pravritti (activity), mentality towards his work. In chapter 2, in the context where Sri Krishna was motivating Arjuna to fulfill his duties, Sri Krishna’s main intention was to make Arjuna wage war. For Arjuna, waging war was a karma (action), an activity that had to be done. He hesitated to perform his duty. Sri Krishna’s objective was to preach that Arjuna must not hesitate to do his duty. Not just for Arjuna, whatever is one’s responsibility, there is no need to hesitate to fulfill his duty. He should do whatever is required to be done.\nTo do that, he needs to have an understanding of two things, specifically for Arjuna here. Firstly, he felt sad looking at his relatives and those who taught him like Bhishma, Drona, etc. They were all related through the body. However, they are the ones who committed crimes. Since there is a necessity to stop them (Kauravas) from committing more crimes, since they are the ones who instigated this war, since they have committed many crimes against them (Pandavas) in the past, Arjuna has a great opportunity now to stop them from committing more sins by waging this war initiated by them and to make sure no more harm is done to the world. Arjuna is now at the forefront of such a war. “Hence, this war is good for you, so go ahead and do it.” Sri Krishna motivates Arjuna.\nThis is what he (Arjuna) must do with the body. The body is an instrument. The soul got it without desiring it. Every one of us got our bodies without desiring it. It is an instrument. We should use it properly. Why should we? Karma, the result of our actions, is the reason why one gets a body. We can’t see it (karma). Yet, Shastra (scripture) says that karma drives us, so we believe it. We believe in karma because of many reasons. We see many variations in bodies and thoughts. These (varied bodies) do not result as per our desire. Yet, they are formed. Not just formed, they drive our actions. Unless there is an underlying reason, such variations wouldn’t exist. That reason is known as karma, since it makes us work.\nMany significant philosophies came into existence to explain how karma is formed. Whatever samskaras (psychological imprints) are there from the activities of many past lives, will continue to be with the soul as vasanas (instincts). There are certain instruments which are always carried by him (soul). They are manas (mind), buddhi (intellect), and indriyas (senses). He (soul) roams around with these along with samskaras as they are in them. He gets a series of bodies one after another with an allocated subset of these karmas. When he uses the body to do his work, the volume of the assigned karmas will be exhausted. To experience another set of past karmas, he will enter a new body. And so on, the succession of bodies continues.\nHowever, there is a certain greatness and uniqueness of the human body. If in this body, one can understand his past samskaras, if he can realize their origin, who is holding them there, who is turning them into activities i.e., giving him an opportunity to get a body and work accordingly… he can erase all his sanchita (accumulated) karmas. Veda (scripture) reveals for us because of who we get a body. He, who can control our samskaras is only one, Sriman Narayana. He is the One standing in front of Arjuna in the avatar (incarnation) of Sri Krishna. Also, the Lord stated this in Bhagavad Gita that He is the one who is bringing the soul in union with the body. He revealed this in the seventh chapter. He called one as apara prakriti (lower nature) and the other as para prakriti (higher nature). He named the combination of body along with indriyas (senses) as apara prakriti. He named the soul as para prakriti. Both are functioning because of Me, said the Lord.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nye: ye:dam dha:ryathe jagath me para: prakruthihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe soul which is called para prakriti is also working because of Me. He makes both of them (body and soul) work, by letting the soul enter it (body).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSince He is making them function, if we can perform saranagati (surrender) to Him, if we take His shelter and pray to Him, He can clear our entire previous stock of karmas. The opportunity to do that is available only to humans. Hence, when people speak of human birth, they say, “It is very difficult to attain.” The time which we have is also very limited. Don’t waste this opportunity. Use this properly and do saranagati, surrender to the Lord. What happens when we do saranagati? He Himself promised in the past, in many incarnations,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyo:ga kshe:mam vaha:myam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI will provide them whatever is required.\n-----------------------------------------------\nLord has declared this many times. In Bhagavad Gita also He clarifies this as we go a little further. Hence, while we are in this body, if we can surrender to the Lord, the stocked up ‘mountain-sized’ loads of karmas of many past lives,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyattha: agnihi utthatha shikhaha kaksham dahathi sa:nalaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\njust as fire burns piles of dried sticks with the cooperation of wind,\n-----------------------------------------------\n…similarly, God’s grace upon surrendering to Him will burn the piles of various kinds of all past karmas. What is the result? The connection which the soul has with the prakriti (nature) will be gone. One need not enter these miserable bodies again. However, one should work with the body. The jnana (knowledge) required to do the work is with jiva (soul). Jiva can’t work just with jnana by himself. He needs an instrument. That instrument is the body. A battery has power, but the battery can’t consume the power by itself. We have to connect it with something, a torchlight. If that external interface is connected, the power in the battery flows through and the instrument lights up. Similarly, jiva’s jnana functions through an instrument called body when he gets it.\nHence, while work must get done through the body, jnana must support the understanding of… “why am I doing this work, how am I doing it, and who am I doing it for?” There are two aspects in the activity which we do with the body. One is the physical activity done through the body. The second is the underlying nischayathmaka jnana (decisive knowledge) that directs it. Both knowledge and the activity need to be perfect [in their functioning]. It is essential for us to know both these aspects. Lord named the perfection in knowledge as Sankhya. The perfection related to the body is called Yoga. One is Sankhya and the other is Yoga. However, these two are not different. We have to remember this. We have to live coordinating both of them, making sure the respective naischalyam (steadiness) is intact, focusing on a single goal. That which enables us to live this way is called buddhi (intellect).\nHence, we need one kind of buddhi in Sankhya and one kind of buddhi in Yoga. This buddhi should cooperate with both. Lord stated this previously,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:sha the abhihitha sa:nkhye buddhihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is the buddhi (intellect) that has been described in Sankhya.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyo:ge thu ima:m buddhim twam srunu:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nNow, let’s discuss how buddhi cooperates with it when turning into activities.\n-----------------------------------------------\nUntil now, we discussed how buddhi should support Sankhya. Now, let’s discuss how buddhi cooperates with it when turning into activities. Sri Krishna conveyed to us in the past that these two are essential for us. Generally, activities done by the body are varied because the body is composed of Nature. There are many objects in Nature and also many experiences. There are people, objects, the related ruchi (interest), and vasanas (instincts) in Nature. When we work with these, we also get some temporary results. However, without focusing on temporary results, one should think of the body as an instrument to experience karmas, and should know that through experiencing karmas, release from the karmic cycle can be achieved. “I have to attain my natural state by experiencing karmas and thus becoming free from them.” This is the only determination he should have.\nOnce developed, whatever joys or sorrows one experiences with the activities he does with the body, should not get over-stressed. If one focuses on them, one will get attached to them. If he continues to do his work, irrespective of what he encounters, he will be freed from karmic bondage and will attain jiva’s natural state. This is in brief, the aspect we have to know. He (Sri Krishna) must explain this to Arjuna. That day, Arjuna had the karma of waging war, so he had to complete that karma. While performing that karma of waging war, he saw his guru, grandfather, maternal uncles, nephews, brothers, and others. He felt sad wondering how he could wage war with them? Irrespective of who he faces, he should do his duty. Though addressing Arjuna, Sri Krishna is teaching this to all of mankind. Whatever tasks one does should be done with this understanding. We should have a goal. We should remember that we have to be released from karmic bondage and do activities with the body.\nBuddhi is of two types. One is to know that getting released from karmic bondage is the primary goal. This buddhi is needed in Sankhya. The second is that we shouldn’t hold onto whatever joys or sorrows we get when carrying out responsibilities. This determination is needed. Explaining this buddhi which encompasses both, Sri Krishna goes further explaining to us along with Arjuna. If he can perform an activity properly like this, it is called karma yoga. It is a difficult and profound word. Since we are listening to Bhagavad Gita, it is essential and beneficial to learn about such terms. Let’s learn! Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), when learning certain scriptures, we need to familiarize ourselves with specific terms. Just like in science, medicine, or sports, where we learn certain terms, familiarizing ourselves with specific terms in the Bhagavad Gita gives us pleasure and understanding. \nCurrently, we are in chapter 2 of Bhagavad Gita. Sri Krishna is instructing Arjuna on being dutiful and how to perform duties properly. In that context, He spoke about two terms, sa:nkhya (knowledge) and yo:ga (means). To properly perform karmas (actions), Sri Krishna instructed him to turn them into yo:ga. Yo:ga means that which joins together. Generally, yo:ga is used in many contexts. The root word \"Yuk\" means to link or to join. \nIn Bhagavad Gita, yo:ga is used to imply 'means'. Karma yoga is a means, jna:na (knowledge) yoga is a means, and further on, akshara parabramha yo:ga is also a means. These means help humans attain life’s goal instead of being caught up in the work they do. \nWhat is the goal of life? Why did we get this human body? We received it not just to eat, sleep, or engage in conflict. The purpose is to free the soul (a:thma) from being trapped in miserable bodies. The one speaking is a:thma, and the one listening is also a:thma. What is visible externally is an instrument provided to a:thma. \nWhen it is growing, we call it de:ha (body). When it is degrading, it is called sari:ra (body). The body grows until about 30 or 35 years and is called de:ha. It adds many things from the food it eats, the water it drinks, and the air and light it receives. This process of adding is called diha upachaye (adding to itself). \nAfter reaching a certain age, the body starts to shrink gradually. Si:ryathe (it gradually shrinks), hence it is called sari:ra. After 35 or 40 years, it enters a deterioration phase. The body is an instrument for a:thma. It is given to help the soul release itself from dependence on nature and the body. \nWe are all dependent on this body and nature. If the body wants us to sleep, we fall asleep. If it wants us to eat or drink, we do so. The body is an instrument for the ji:va (indwelling soul) to attain its natural state. How and when to use this instrument is explained in Bhagavad Gita, categorized into different chapters. \nWhy should I be released from this body? We don’t have any problem staying in it, but we know we are limited by it. Knowing about your Self is called a:thma ya:da:thmya jna:na (knowledge of the true nature of the soul). It is not enough to know that there is a soul, which is ‘I’, and that it is separate from the body. \nHowever, we need to know how a:thma exists and what its natural state is. The one controlling it from behind the scenes is parama:thma (Supreme Soul). A:thma is under the control of parama:thma and works according to His wish. A:thma needs to come out of the body to its natural state. \nBeing dependent on parama:thma is not the same as being dependent on the body and nature. While being dependent, if its natural state is lost, that is painful. A:thma belongs to parama:thma in its natural state, experiencing bliss. Everyone wants to be happy, yet we face many diseases and inconveniences that spoil our happiness. \nParama:thma, who supports the soul, gives that undisturbed state of happiness. The Lord provides flawless, eternal happiness to the soul. If something in its natural state has other elements, it is flawed. The Lord gives an eternally pure blissful state to the soul. \nThe a:thma needs to reach parama:thma and experience its natural state of bliss. Whatever obstructs us from reaching parama:thma should be shed off. This obstruction is called bandha (bond), resulting from karma, hence it is called karma bandha (karmic bondage). \nMoksha (release) is the release from this karmic bondage. It doesn’t mean death; it means release from the cycle of rebirth. Moksha is the release from karma bandha. If released from that, we won’t have any problem wherever we are. \nRelease from karmic bondage is moksha, and this should be the only goal of human life. While in this body, that should be our primary goal. This is e:ka (one type). This is sa:nkhya (knowledge about the soul). This is nischaya (decisive knowledge). \nNischaya can mean vyavasa:ya (business) or adhyavasa:ya (determined knowledge). We must have this jna:na (knowledge). If we have this, whatever we do doesn’t inconvenience us. As long as we have this, we keep progressing toward our goal, regardless of favorable or unfavorable experiences. \nIf we don’t have this goal, we won’t be firm in our activities. If our decision is firm, we will try to transform unfavorable conditions into favorable ones. It is important to apply our nischaya jna:na in sa:nkhya and to the activity we do with the body, known as yo:ga. \nThis buddhi (intellect) must support jna:na and the activity. We should apply buddhi with activity, accepting anything that doesn’t contradict sa:nkhya buddhi and keeping away from anything that does. This is called yo:ge buddhi. \nWhile discussing this, the Lord said:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:sha the abbhihitha sa:nkhye bhuddhihi yo:ge buddhihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“This is what I call the intellect of knowledge and the intellect of means.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nJust like how buddhi is of two types, yo:ga buddhi is also of two types. Prior to this, we categorized buddhi into two: sa:nkhya buddhi and yo:ga buddhi. Sa:nkhya buddhi is of two types, and yo:ga buddhi is of two types. Let's try to learn what they are. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is an amazing scripture. It bestows on us numerous noteworthy concepts from Vedas, and many embedded secrets from Upanishads in an easily comprehensible manner. If we can pay a little attention and focus, the great scripture of Bhagavad Gita offers clarity of concepts in simple terms. Some of those terms are karma yoga (the path of action), nishka:ma karma (selfless action), karma yoga, and yoga. All four words are in fact synonyms. Whether it is yoga or karma yoga or nishka:ma karma, these words all mean the same. However, some say nishka:ma karma yoga.\nKarma refers to the activity one does. Whenever we do something, we do it with a desire. We work thinking, ‘I would like to get something out of this activity’. When we think ‘I am doing this because I want something out of it’, the underlying ‘want’ is called ka:ma (desire), the desire. ‘I am working to fulfill my desire, to achieve something’. ‘I plant a seed as I want its fruit.’ Or ‘I grind something as I want this type of material out of it.’ Or ‘I am doing this as I want to benefit from it.’ Or ‘I am working as I want salary.’ We work because we want something. Right? There is a desire driving the work. That desire is called ka:ma. The related activity is called ka:mya (action done with desire). So, ka:mya is the activity done with ka:ma, i.e., desire. Activity done expecting a result is called ka:mya karma.\nHowever, some activities are not ka:mya karmas. Imagine a mother bathing her son. She never does it thinking, ‘Since I am bathing him, he has to pay me this much.’ She never acts thinking, ‘Because I am bathing him, he will say thanks to me or pay me fees.’ The mother feels sad if she does not bathe him! If she does not take care of her child and serve him properly, she feels sad and inadequate, as if lacking in a difficult situation. Such acts are not done with ka:ma, desire. It is called nishka:ma karma. It is an activity done without expecting any benefit. This is also called karma yoga or simply yoga. Yoga or nishka:ma karma or karma yoga, they all mean the same. We perform such an activity as an outpour of deep love for others. They are done without expecting any benefit.\nWhen such activity is done, not limiting it to physical relationships, not expecting any benefit or favorable outcome for the body alone, expecting uththama purusha:rdha (ultimate goal), if one does an activity without mentally expecting any profit for himself out of it, he will attain benefits of the highest order. We usually desire only visible benefits. We do not ask for intangible benefits. When we eat food, we do it to satiate hunger. It gives temporary happiness. We can see these visible benefits and experience them physically. If we use a hand fan to air dry ourselves, we feel temporary relief from heat. It is visible and can be experienced. If we bow to God, we do not directly perceive any benefit. When we chant a mantra, we do not see any immediate perceivable benefit. \nSo, are these beneficial or not? Some say, ‘By bowing or meditating we feel a sense of tranquility’. That is ok. If it’s only to attain the temporary benefit of tranquility, then it will limit the benefit to that alone. However, without desiring such temporary benefit, if he meditates as an expression of gratitude towards God for all the benefit He has provided for us, it will become a means to moksha (liberation). Even this is karma. If the temporary benefit can be set aside, which will be received anyway, if a specific thing is all that is desired, then the benefit will be limited to that, assuming the act is done properly; otherwise, he will not even attain that temporary benefit. \nHowever, if one does the act without such desire, then it will transform him in such a way that the soul’s karmic bondage is broken and he gains its original identity. Not just for meditation alone, it is applicable to activities such as eating, bathing, or exercising. Any physical activity definitely gives certain temporary benefits. Exercise gives energy to the body, bathing gives revitalization. If he does these activities thinking they yield such limited benefits, then they yield only those benefits. However, thinking that waking up, exercising, bathing is part of the service to God, that this body is provided by God and that it’s His tool, and that every activity done by the body and every breath taken is part of the service to God, if these activities are carried out with such spirit, then even taking a bath will become a tool for the soul’s liberation, consuming food will become a tool for the soul’s liberation, breathing will become a tool for the soul’s liberation.\nAn activity performed not expecting results, and not desiring any temporary benefits, any bodily activity devoid of expectations is called nishka:ma karma, a karma with no expectations. It transforms into karma yoga. Karma, the activity, became a tool. It becomes a yoga, means, to unite with the ultimate eternal goal. It thus becomes yoga, karma yoga, and nishka:ma karma. It thus becomes a tool for moksha, liberation! This is a key concept that Bhagavad Gita aims to teach. To learn this, we must have conviction. We learned earlier that such conviction is called adhyavasa:yam. One must have determined knowledge, vyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi (resolute intellect), about soul, body, and the activities done by the body.\nWe learned earlier that it is of two types each. There are two aspects of knowledge related to the soul. First: Soul and body are different from each other. Simple! Soul is not the body because it is not visible. Its existence is not felt anywhere in the body. Because the soul is said to be minute, it is probably very small in size. It is not like anything that the body is composed of. Soul is a different substance and a different reality than the body. That’s it. Therefore, the first aspect is the common knowledge that the soul is different from the body. This is also a type of buddhi, knowledge. It is one facet of sankhya buddhi (knowledge of the soul).\nAnother facet of sankhya buddhi is knowing soul’s yadha:thmya jnana (knowledge of the reality of the soul), that is, knowing the reality of it exactly as is. It’s a state of perfection. It means, what is soul? How does it manifest? It belongs to Him. How does it belong to Him? In how many ways? Clear knowledge of this is referred to as soul’s yadha:thmya jnana. Just knowing that the body is different from the soul is considered… samanya jnana (basic knowledge of the soul). One is samanya jnana, basic knowledge and the other is visesha jnana (deeper knowledge). Therefore, sankhya buddhi is of two types. One is samanya buddhi. One needs to be firm about this as well. The other is visesha buddhi, that is to know it as it is. These are the two types.\nHow are these two types useful? If one only knows that the body is different from the soul, that knowledge becomes useful to seek better places than these bodies, for happiness. There exists a heaven somewhere, known as Indra loka (the realm of Indra), where one can attain certain pleasures by performing specific activities. Vedas say - swarga kamo yaje:tha (one who desires heaven should perform sacrifices). He knows that there exists a soul different from the body. It doesn’t perish like the body and is eternal. Soul doesn’t perish like a body does. na hanyathe: hanya ma:ne sari:re (the soul is not killed when the body is killed). It is enough to know that the soul does not perish when the body is disintegrating. Having known this, he will strive for a better state that is higher than the current one, i.e., being in this body. This is considered basic knowledge of the soul. It is beneficial only to this extent.\nHowever, if he wants to reach God, completely liberated from karmic bondage and attain eternal bliss, this basic knowledge is insufficient. He will need the soul’s yadha:thmya jnana, clear knowledge. He must develop unwavering knowledge of that. This is called vyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi e:ka (resolute, single-minded intellect). These are the two types of sankhya buddhi. Moving to the next one, we alluded earlier to the two types of buddhi with respect to yoga. One is whether we should desire fruits or not while performing activities with this body. The second one is whether we should focus on temporary or permanent benefit while performing an action. These are the two types of yoga buddhi.\nLet’s see what ‘performing duty focusing on temporary benefit’ means. In general, every activity yields a result, whether it is raising, stretching, or moving, or folding a hand. It yields results. Every activity yields a result. Do we do this activity desiring that temporary benefit or a permanent benefit? We should possess these two types of knowledge in yoga. One must have decisive knowledge in this as well. Imagine that a mom sends her son to procure flour from a market. On the way to the market, the son runs into several things. He stops to see a fascinating street performer. Later, a friend stops him to show something interesting. Then someone else gets his attention to discuss random topics. He gets distracted by what his friend showed him and enjoyed the acts of the street performer. These are the temporary benefits that he received on the way. \nIs he going to be stuck by these? Is he doing yoga, or ‘work’, seeking temporary benefits? Is he being steadfast in his goal until he gets what his mom asked for? If the goal is in focus, then he will not be distracted by anything along the way. If the goal is wavering, then whatever he sees along the way will distract him as they also give certain results. However, he is getting diverted by these results. He is losing track of his goal. Therefore, even in yoga there should be certainty on the two types. Is it the temporary benefit or permanent benefit? Is it the basic knowledge of the soul or is it soul’s yadha:thmya jnana? This is the certainty one needs to have related to the knowledge of sankhya and yoga. What benefit does this certainty give? Speaking about this, Sri Krishna is leading us into verse 2.41. Let’s learn about it further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We are now at verse 2.41. Sri Krishna preaches to Arjuna about buddhi (intellect). What is a discerning intellect and what does it do?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhihi e:ka: iha kuru nandana ! |\nbahusa:kha:hi anantha:s cha buddha:yaha avyavasa:yina:m ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe intellect that is determined is one-pointed, O Kuru's son!

Vyavasa:yi: is one whose intellect is firm. He sets his knowledge decisively on one subject. Here, vyavasa:yam (determined) doesn’t mean agriculture or growing crops (as in Telugu language). \nVyavasa:ya:ha nischayaha (decisive knowledge), one with nischaya jna:na (decisive knowledge) is single-minded - e:ka (one). On what? iha (in this subject). In which subject? In sa:nkhya (knowledge of the soul). He has only one goal. He is determined to identify a:thma (soul) as it is and attain it. \nLord is addressing Arjuna as ‘Hey, Kuru nandana’ (O son of Kuru). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhihi e:ka:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe intellect that is determined is one-pointed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat’s the other one? Avyavasa:yi:na:m (one who is not determined about anything). How is his intellect? Bahu sha:kha:hi anantha:scha (just as there are many branches of a tree, each one in a different direction). Just like these branches face different directions, his intellect is multi-directional. There is no end to that. He is pulled into different directions. He is not focused, the avyavasa:yi (undetermined).\nLet’s take a couple of examples from the world. One is determined to achieve a gold medal in the Olympics. He wanted to win a gold medal in running 200 meters. What does he do? Daily, he wakes up and starts running. His target is to run 200 meters in a minute or less than a minute. To achieve this, he practices running 300 or 400 meters in a minute before he goes to the competition. He continues to work hard for it. He practices in a way that he could run that distance blindfolded.\nDuring his practice days, if his friend comes and asks him to go to a movie, he says he is busy. Or if someone asks him to go on a picnic, he refuses. Or someone asks him to go to a resort or Goa or some islands like Maldives or Mauritius for a week - he refuses. He is not interested in anything else because his goal is the upcoming competitions. His mind is not pulled into anything else. \nIf he has to go somewhere forcibly, he doesn’t get excited about the temporary associated pleasures. Let's say his friends pressured him and took him along to a resort. They serve him with many tasty foods there. He eats because he has to eat. Yet, he doesn’t pay attention to the taste of the food or the beautiful surroundings. He is only focused on his goal, which is to win a gold medal in the 200 meter race. Even at the resort, if he finds some time, he will start running. Why? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhihi e:ka:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe intellect that is determined is one-pointed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThere is another guy. He is a foodie. He doesn’t have any such goals. He goes to the buffet, appreciates all the food items, thoroughly enjoys them, and then wants to sleep. Because he has no goal. Sometimes he gets absorbed in eating. If someone takes him and shows something beautiful, he gets absorbed in that. If someone shows something else - he gets absorbed in that - bahu sha:kha:ha (many branches). Since he is not focused, whichever is favorable for him at whatever time and whatever place, he keeps getting attracted to that - bahu sha:kha:ha anantha:scha buddha:ya (the intellect of the undetermined is multi-branched and endless). Whatever he finds attractive, he thinks that’s good enough.\nIf another one wants to score 100 percent in an exam, say accounting. What does he do? He studies day and night. If you place a beautiful bed for him to sleep in, he will sleep on that, but he doesn’t care for the comfort of the bed. If you give him something to drink, he drinks it, but he doesn’t pay attention to what he is drinking. Undistracted, he practices to achieve his goal and attains it. \nWe are familiar with this. Those who desire temporary benefits will attain only those. If we go to a temple and pay obeisances, the priest gives us some prasa:d (sanctified food). Do we go to the temple for prasad or to receive God’s grace after we pay obeisances? As a child, during dhanur ma:sa (a month in the Hindu calendar), we would run to the local temple by 5:30 / 6 am to get pongal or daddyo:janam (tasty rice dishes) from the priest. Devotees of prasa:d! That is also a benefit, but is it the only benefit? That is a temporary benefit at the temple. \nIf someone gives something else somewhere, everyone runs there. If you have firm belief that when you pay obeisances to God, you will get His grace, whatever temporary benefits that come in between will keep coming even if you don’t desire them. Once you go, the priest will give you thi:rtha (holy water), sata:ri (a ceremonial cloth), and prasa:da anyway. However, if you go, desiring only those, you may or may not get them at times. \nThus, we have to decide if our intellect should focus on temporary benefits or aim for permanent ones. In verse 2.41, Sri Krishna teaches us to become vyavasa:yi:s (determined) and not avyavasa:yi:s (undetermined). Generally, those around us try to make us avyavasa:yi:s, yet you have to become a vyavasa:yi.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhihi e:ka: iva:\nbahusa:kha:hi anantha:s cha buddha:yaha avyavasa:yina:m ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe intellect that is determined is one-pointed, while the intellect of the undetermined is multi-branched and endless.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn fact, Vedas also give some examples regarding this. They explain Vedic Shroutha Prakriya, a process defined in Vedas for those desiring swarga (heaven). Swarga is his main goal. Whoever is desiring this swarga should do darsa purna ma:sa (full moon day rituals). Darsa is an activity to be done on ama:va:sya (no moon day). Pu:rna Ma:si is the activity to be done on Pu:rnima (full moon day). \nThere are three yajna:s (acts of worship) with an objective for each, darsa and purna ma:sa. The 3 yajna:s for purna ma:si are a:gne:yam, agni:shomi:um, and upa:msu ya:ja:m. Each yajna has its own benefits. If you desire those benefits and do that yajna properly, it will give only those benefits. If you don’t desire those temporary benefits and perform any of the yajnas, a:gne:yam, agnishomium, or upa:msu ya:ja:m, this becomes a means for you to attain swarga (heaven). \nSwarga is the primary goal, right? We are not desiring the temporary benefits from the yajna:s. You will get those benefits regardless of whether you desire them or not, that’s the irony. If you desire temporary benefits, it only gives those. However, if you don’t desire them, you attain the higher goal and the intermediary benefits as well. We have to remember this. \nSimilarly, when performing darsa - there are 3 yajnas, a:gne:yam, aindradadhi, and aindrapayas. Veda instructs those desiring swarga to perform these.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nya e:vam vidhwa:n amava:sya:ya:m yajathe\n    ya e:vam vidhwa:n pourna ma:sya:m yajathe\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose who perform these rituals on the no moon day and full moon day, knowing their significance, attain swarga.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat happens if we perform these? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:tha:bhyam darsa pourna ma:sa:bhya:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne attains swarga, the primary result from performing the two yajnas.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf done only desiring swarga, even when achieving the temporary benefits, the main goal is not lost. If performing them desiring temporary benefits, one attains them but misses the main goal. He needs to have vyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi (decisive intellect) on this. Those who desire temporary benefits are avyavasa:yi:s. Sri Krishna teaches us not to desire temporary benefits. \nWhat are those temporary benefits? When we perform yajnas like a:gne:yam, Vedas list the intermediary benefits we may get. However, whatever yajnas one does, one desires a long life, right? It is said, “if you do yajna, you will get swarga.” Imagine a plane arrives and they ask you to board as soon as you complete the yajna - saying, “This is the result of your yajna, we will now take you to swarga!” One will not be ready to get in, to go to swarga immediately. \nIf he is taken to swarga via flight as soon as a yajna is complete, others will never discuss this yajna. It gets regarded as poisonous. What does he expect? When does he want the benefit? He wants certain benefits as long as he is alive and desires swarga after he leaves this body. As long as he is alive, he wants a long life, children, relatives, all righteous activities, mansions, and comforts. He wants all these. How can he not want these? \nHence, Veda says ayu:r a:s:a a:sthe (you will get long life). Though you are doing the yajna desiring swarga, you will live long because of performing the recommended yajnas… supraja: twama:tha a:sthe (you will have good children). sa ja:tha vanasya ma:sa a:sthe (siblings and other relatives around you will be happy). utta:ra:m de:va yajya:m a:sa asthe (whatever deeds you do will be transformed into yajna:s, yielding good results). bhu:yo havishkarana ma: sa:sthe: (you will be able to perform such activities like yajnas again). divyam dha:ma:m a:sthe (you will be bestowed with lavish mansions). \nYou will attain all this. If you desire these, you will get only these. If you do it without desiring temporary benefits, you will get these along with swarga. This is explained in Vedic prakriya (procedures described in Vedas). Whatever activity we do, if we perform it believing it to be a result of God’s grace and as His command, and with the primary focused aim as moksha (release from karmic bondage), we will get that along with other benefits. \nIf we get attracted to temporary benefits and stop at only desiring those, we may or may not achieve them. Hence, do not get distracted by them. Have a determined mind. Perform each of your tasks single-mindedly. Practice karma yoga. Thus, Sri Krishna preaches to Arjuna about the process of practicing karma yoga in verse 2.41. \nJai Srimannarayana! Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), when one has decisiveness and vast experience in a field, it bestows sre:yas (well-being) for him. There is a saying, “Jack of all trades and master of none.” Dabbling in many fields but not having proper experience in any of them does not benefit a person. It is important to gain proficiency in any particular field and lead life with that as the primary means.\nGenerally, when large companies manufacture a product, they assemble various components to make one primary product. For example, let's take a car manufacturing company. There are many parts like wheels, chassis, dome, items in the dome, steering, brakes, and an accelerator. Once we visited a car factory. There is a long assembly line, nearly a kilometer long. Assembly of the car starts at the beginning of the line. By the time it comes to the end of the assembly line, the car is completely assembled.\nThere are people at assigned stations to perform specific tasks in the line. One person will only fix tires, the next one for the windows, the next one for steering, the next one for the wipers, and so on. Each person has a task. When the car comes to them, they have to immediately fix the part in it, and then the car moves forward. The car is with him for 5 seconds. In these 5 seconds, he has to assemble the component perfectly in the car. \nIn the beginning, it takes time as he doesn’t have much experience. However, after a few days, he can do it blindfolded, as he becomes highly proficient. He focuses on that single-mindedly. He doesn’t get distracted from it. He has a comfortable chair, water to drink, nice air conditioning with a cool breeze, along with a noisy working space. However, none of these affect his mind, distracting him from his task. He simply focuses on fixing the part in the car when it reaches him. After which, the car immediately moves ahead. The person next to him assembles his component, and the car proceeds further. \nIn less than a minute, approximately 55 seconds, the car gets built from scratch and leaves the warehouse. A car per minute! A car per minute!! Maybe there are larger companies that can assemble even faster; we don’t know. In the company we visited, a car is getting assembled in a minute, meaning people at their assigned stations are totally focused on their task throughout the entire line. People there also pay close attention to the time, taking breaks when needed. They focus single-mindedly on their task while taking care of all other things without paying much attention. The task gets accomplished, and he also addresses his other bodily needs.\nSimilarly, for any being who came into this human body, getting rid of karma bandha (karmic bondage) and attaining moksha (liberation from karmic bondage) should be the only goal. Setting that as his goal, he has to perform any duties prescribed to him. He should do whatever is required for his livelihood. He cannot avoid doing that, regardless. However, nowadays we are seeing people who think making money is the only goal. Everyone has one goal - money, money, earn money somehow. \nIn whatever manner you earn it, through the demise of COVID patients or other nefarious means…just earn money, nothing else! Just earn money, earn money - shocking! What will you do after earning so much? We don’t know. What will happen to your riches once you leave the body? We don’t know. Who will take care of it all? We don’t know. When you come into this body, all these should be there, but these are not permanent. Don’t waste your valuable atma jnana (knowledge of the soul) for these things. You got that jnana for a higher purpose. \nHowever, do the intermediary activities as you can’t avoid them. Whatever you need to use for the main purpose, don’t use it for temporary things. Let's say there is a company. There are some tasks to be done by workers like breaking the stones and moving them from one place to another. The owner has to think about how to develop his business. Every minute is very valuable for him. The worker does the physical work like lifting the stones, breaking the stones, putting them in a pile, putting them on the other side, etc. He can only do that much. He can’t do the work which needs to be done with the mind. \nThe worker’s activity is physical, while the owner has intellectual activity. Putting his mind to work, the owner can take care of thousands of such workers. He can provide them livelihood and support them. Instead of using his mind for that, if he says, “I will also sit and break stones,” and starts doing that, it means he is using a very valuable thing for something which is not worth it. It is like if someone gives you a vajra:yudha (weapon of thunderbolt), and you use it to slice onions. That is so inferior and lowly. Human life is so precious. We shouldn’t spoil it by using it for temporary purposes. \nWe should set our mind on the main goal. Whatever comes temporarily, enjoy them. We are not saying you should leave them. However, you shouldn’t forget the main goal by getting lost in temporary pursuits. It is not important to just do something in life. Few people say, “It is fine. He is doing something. Let him do it. How does it matter?” No! You should understand God’s tatva (eternal truth). Keep Him in mind. Do whatever you do as His ajna (divine command), and think of it as His seva (service) while doing it. If He and His command are not in your mind, you are losing in both ways.\n“Does it matter which God you pray to? All one needs is bhakti (devotion). All Gods are one.” How will all of them be one? Whomever we are calling as Gods, their names, forms, work, and places are different. How can they be one? Veda teaches us about all of this, as God is not a familiar subject area to us. We don’t know how He is either. He is not accessible to our intellect. Veda has to tell us about it. Veda said, hri:schathe: lakshmi:scha pathnau e:ko na:ra:yanaha (He is Narayana). \nVeda is explaining to us that He is Narayana. It clarifies that everything is under His control and we need to reach Him. Set Him as your goal. All the devathas (celestial beings) are divine forms under His control meant for a certain task. We shouldn’t criticize them, abuse them, or leave them. They have their place, task, and purpose. Don’t ignore them and don’t get absorbed in them. You should have a goal. Secondly, you should know the work you are doing is a means to attain it.\n“How does it matter what we do as long as we do something?” That’s not correct. One person went to a large railway station with 50 platforms. He has to go to Delhi. Someone told him that he has to go to platform number 6 and board the train there. He went to the central bridge and noticed platform 6 was crowded and thought it a hassle to manage that crowd. He noticed platform number 2 was empty. He thought it was peaceful and went there. The train arrived. The train at platform 6 was full of people, but the train at platform number 2 was neat and empty. He felt, “Oh, it is so nice. I will just board this train instead.” \nThinking this, he sat and even slept on the train. The train started. “It’s important to take the journey irrespective of the train you take, right?” [sarcastically]. Just like certain people say, “All we need is bhakti; it doesn't matter which bhakti.” “Anything is good. All are one.” yad bha:va thad bhavathi (we attain whatever we think of). Hence, he got into the train and slept happily as it was empty. After half an hour, the ticket collector woke him up asking for a ticket. He presented his ticket. \n[T.C] This ticket is for Delhi. Why did you get into this train? \n[Man] Because this train was empty. \n[T.C] This train goes to Madras. \n[Man] I got in because it is empty. Anyway, it's going. How does it matter which train I take? \n[T.C] First get down from this train, pay a 2000 rupee fine, and stay in jail for half a day. \nHe was put in jail and fined. Is it important to just go anywhere? Is it important to just do anything? No! We need to know where to go and how to go. It is also very important to have perfect decisive knowledge about it. That is named vyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhi (decisive intelligence) by Sri Krishna in verse 2.41. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhi hi ek:eva kuru nandana\nSLOKA MEANING -\nDecisive intelligence is only one, O son of Kuru (Arjuna).\n-----------------------------------------------\nbahu sa:kha:hi anantha:scha buddhayaha: avyavasa:yi:na:m (Those who are not decisive have many branches of thought). He is not decisive. If he had decided to go to Delhi, he would have taken that train even if it inconvenienced him. However, that is not his goal. His goal is to comfortably go somewhere. That’s why he sat in the other train and ended up in jail. It shouldn’t happen this way. Thus, aim for only the moksha (the primary goal).\nOne may argue that Vedas themselves have said, “one should live a long life with mansions and other things.” True, that is said. “Why should they say that? It would have been better if they didn't mention those things at all.” “If you do this yajna (sacrifice), you get this benefit. If you do the other one, you will get other benefits.” “Why did it have to say this and divert our mind? It would have been better if it didn’t say it at all.” If it just stated one goal, it would have been fine. Thus, Veda is leading us down a wrong path. Since Veda said it, it is fine to do other yajnas. There are people who say this as well. Sri Krishna is giving us an upadesa (teaching) about such people in verse 2.42. Let’s learn about it.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 101,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Our manas (mind) is named samadhi (meditative state) by Sri Krishna in Bhagavad Gita. Why did He name it as such? Because…\nManas, an instrument for us, i.e., for jivas (souls), receives perceptions from all the indriyas (senses) and supports them. It’s a capsulized form called sukshma sharira (subtle body). The jiva, along with God, stays safely within the one containing indriyas and manas. It is with this sukshma sharira that the soul travels from one body to another body.\nThis manas is a very important instrument. In this manas, our buddhi (intellect), knowledge, should be stable. When it is stable, it is called “samadhi.” In Telugu, there are several meanings. People sometimes refer to samadhi as taking someone’s body, digging a pit, and burying him there. It is referred to as performing samadhi (to that body). \nWhat happens there is wherever you position the body, it fills in that space completely, steadily without moving. This is what it means, right? Normally, if we are placed on the bed, then do we stay still without moving? We move from side to side over time. We bend and stretch - we sleep on our stomach for some time and on our back for some time. However, the one who is buried doesn’t move from side to side or move when in pain. He neither bends nor stretches. He stays stationary regardless of the space given to him, without any movements. Hence, that state is called “samadhi.”\nLet’s assume that manas is a beautiful container. We need to fill this manas with knowledge. We (soul) are dwelling in [the body] and we possess knowledge. Depending on how we fill knowledge in [the manas], its name changes. If the knowledge filled inside the manas is constantly in flux, that state of manas is called chitta (mind). That means it is unsteadily moving along with the knowledge within.\nIf in a state where it is discerning of the knowledge within, then it is called manas. This same instrument, this container, if it holds [the knowledge within] and thinks, “Yes, this is how we should do,” thus, if it is discerning, then it is called manas. That means, if it is in a state of constantly meditating on whatever it contains, it is called manas. If it is constantly unsteady, then the same is called chitta.\nOccasionally, the knowledge in the manas stops showing the soul within and shows only the body; whatever is comfortable and required for the body, other than that, it doesn’t consider anything else. It means it’s only focusing outward. Only external contacts matter to it. Whatever is inside, it detaches from it and doesn’t even recognize it. Whatever is outside, it considers that as “I.” Actually, who should be identified as “I”? In fact, it is the indwelling jiva that should be identified as ‘I.’ \nHowever, what is the manas doing with the knowledge within? It is considering the external organs and body as “I.” Everything related to this is mine. It ties him (jiva) to that, focusing only towards that (body). Whatever is required for that (body), it is working towards that. This is called ahamkara (ego) or aham bhava (sense of self). \nWhat did this ahamkara do? It makes one overlook aham (I) and makes one think of whatever is not aham as aham. \nanaham aham kriyathe: (the non-I is considered as I)\nIt makes us believe that the body, which is not aham, is aham. Then this manas is called ahamkara. Thus, we can call it by three names. If it is discerning, it is called manas. If it is fluctuating, it is chitta. If it is attached to the body only, it is called ahamkara. If it acquires the knowledge which needs to be acquired and steadily fills it within, then it is called buddhi (intellect) or adhyavasaya (determination). This is also called samadhi. \nLet’s understand how it got this name. \ndhi: (intellect), dhi yathate (that which holds within) asmin iti dhi: (this is called dhi)\nTake for example, the ocean. What is the ocean doing? It is storing all the water within itself, in full. Jalam dhi yathate asmin (water is held within). That’s why it is called jaladhi (ocean). Jalam (water) is also called vari. It is storing “vari” within itself “dhi,” in full, hence it is called varidhi (ocean). Both varidhi and jaladhi mean ocean.\nWhat is this manas doing? If it stores all the nischaya-aatmaka jnana (decisive knowledge) within itself properly, then it is called adhyavasaya. Based on the way it is storing this knowledge, it has acquired that name. How did it store it? Completely, “a” “dhi.” “a” means all over, “dhi” means filled itself with it. Hence it is named as adhi. Whose name is it? It is the name of the container known as manas.\nYou might have heard words like adhis and vyadhis. Vyadhi means the disease of the body. Adhi means disease of manas. If someone has gone crazy (mental illness), then it is adhi. Or if they have an illusion, that is adhi. They say adhis and vyadhis, right? Vyadhi is a disease of the body and adhi is a disorder of manas. \nIf it is completely filled in the manas, it is called adhi. If it is filled in a certain way, it is called adhi. However, if it is completely filled with unshaken ultimate knowledge transformed into belief, in such a way that there is no room for anything else… it is called “sam” “a” “dhi,” samadhi. This is the name of the manas. Samadhi doesn’t mean a graveyard; it is manas, the one which filled itself with good knowledge.\nSri Krishna preaches this through to verse 2.44. Verses 2.42, 2.43, and 2.44 - these three slokas (verses) are a package. In verse 2.41, He said, the one who possesses the nischaya-aatmika (decisive) knowledge has only one goal in mind. The one who doesn’t have decisive knowledge has multiple goals. He says, “anantha:ha bahu sa:kha:ha” (many branches without end). \nWhy are they turning into bahu sa:kha:ha, branched in multiple directions? Why are they turning into anantha? Because in the manas, there is no firmness about the one.\nvyavasa:ya:thmika: budhihi sama:dhau na vidhi:yathe: (focused knowledge does not exist in their mind)\nIn the manas, vyavasa:ya:thmika budhihi (focused knowledge) is not firm because it is not still. Why is this not firm for them? Because, through their physical organs, their manas is attracted to external things. How?\nya:mima:m pushpitha:m va:cham pravadhanthi: avipaschithaha | (those who speak flowery words)\nve:dava:daratha:h pa:rttha! na:nyad asthi:thi va:dinaha || (they claim there is nothing else)\nka:ma:thma:nas svargapara:hajanma karma phalaprada:m | (their desires lead them to heaven and the fruits of their actions)\nkriya: vise:sha bahula:mbho:gaisvarya gathim prathi || (they engage in many activities for material pleasures)\nbho:gaisvarya prasaktha:na:mthaya::pahrutha che:thasa:m | (their minds are distracted by material wealth)\nvyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhihisama:dhau: na vidhi:yathe: || (focused knowledge does not exist in their mind)\nVyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhi (focused knowledge) doesn’t exist in their manas. Why? Because they are a:pahrutha che:thasa:s (distracted minds). Their manas is distracted by others. What is distracting their manas? \nbho:gaisvarya prasaktha:na:m (their focus is on materialistic pleasures and wealth)\nTheir knowledge is focused on that. Their mind is eager to experience that repeatedly. Thus, the focus shifted in that direction. \nbho:gaisvarya prasaktha:na:m - where is their focus? \nbho:gaisvarya gathim prathi (their focus is on acquiring materialistic pleasures and wealth)\nThere are different kinds of pleasures and wealth, right? For eyes, it is in different images. So, they gravitate towards sights. For ears, it is sounds. So, they are drawn towards that. For the nose, it is the smell. So, it needs to go towards that. For the tongue, it is taste. So, it is drawn towards that. For skin, it is touch. So, it needs to go towards that. Consequently, when they all go that route, some efforts also need to be put in, correct? Each one requires a different type of effort.\nkriya: vise:sha bahula:m – They have so many activities to complete that we have no idea how many activities there are. What do all these do? \njanma karma phalaprada:m – The work they do leads them into earning karma and janma (birth). Every karma they do, every result they reap will earn them a different janma. That means they are paving paths for new births. \nWhat do we really need? We need to cut the succession of births. We shouldn’t return to such pitiful births. Which in turn results in further births with new results and new karmas. \njanma karma phalaprada:m – It incurs more effort, earning more results and drowning them into myriad births. Where is their focus? \nsvargapara:ha (heaven is their ultimate goal)\n“I want to acquire more comfort than my current levels of comfort. I want only that svargam (heaven), I don’t want anything else.” For a drunkard, drinking is heaven. For someone who watches movies, watching them is heaven. For a player, playing itself is heaven. That is para, the ultimate goal for him, svarga para:ha. These are para for them and nothing else. \nWhenever they do something, their focus flows toward that desire. \nKa:ma:thma: (their minds are fully engaged in desires)\nTheir manas is fully engaged in all these desires. They argue that there is nothing outside of this. \nna:nyad asthi:thi va:dinaha (they claim this is the essence)\nThey take Vedas as authority. \nve:dava:daratha:ha (they use Vedas as the foundation for their argument)\nIn reality, it is not necessary. \nya:mima:m pushpitham va:cham pravadhanthi: (if we hear them, flowery eloquence flows into our ears)\nMeaning, it feels like this is the greatest thing ever. Thus, in several ways, they use Vedas as the authority, specifically the parts which discuss about karmas, considering this the most important, arguing that there is nothing other than this, running behind the desires, earning new births, they go through physically strenuous activities, considering material comforts and wealth as the ultimate goal. \nWith manas gusting towards this, they become avyavasa:yis (those without focused knowledge). They do not have ekathmika jnanam (focused knowledge) or nischaya:thmika jnanam (decisive knowledge). Hence they become avyavasa:yis. \nWe shouldn’t become like that, Arjuna! So, keep only one goal in mind and perform your duty. Thus, Sri Krishna instructs Arjuna to perform his duty and moves forward in this second chapter. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), A human being should always be determined to reach a goal. A life without a goal is worthless. It is not important just to live. As a human, it is essential that we establish a goal and lead life to achieve it. Life will present us with several unsolicited results in the pursuit of our goal. Some of them may be favorable, and others unfavorable. When the goal is firmly set, we ignore any intermediate results whatever they may be. Whenever the results are favorable, we do not get overly excited, while when they are unfavorable, we do not cry profusely. Since we have a goal, we continue to move towards it. This is required for everyone. If there is no goal, one gets lost. For every human, there should be only one goal. What is it? To be freed from karma (the results of past actions), and reach God’s abode. When? After leaving this body [at death]. We should live as per the norms of this body while we reside in it. After that, we should reach there [God's abode]. We must work as long as we are in the body. In our body, we have physical, mental, and intellectual strengths. We need to leverage these strengths in different areas appropriately. We need to ensure that the intellect is not distracted [from the goal]. It is also essential that the focus of the mind is not disturbing the goal. Even the physical work we do must be performed in a way that is not troublesome to them [mind and intellect]. Everything should align with what is important, the goal, not interfere with it.\nIn an office, there is an owner. Let’s say we have 5-6 levels of management under him. The levels of management must act in a manner that is not in conflict, but in alignment with the owner. Only then, do they become part of the organization. Otherwise, they become disruptive to the core. Executives such as CEO, CFO, etc., must act in such a manner that they are not in conflict with the organization’s owner. Others under executives like the president, etc. must not act in conflict with those executives. Other employees under them should work in alignment with their managers. Other staff members under them should work in alignment with their respective managers. We are all aware of this fact. The lower levels work appropriately [as parts of the system] only when aligned with the topmost. There may be different requirements for the staff below. If the staff below works in a silo and the level above works as they wish, and the next level above is working on their own as per their own wish not in synchronization with others, then the owner’s goal will be destroyed. These are all its parts. All the constituents should work in such a way that the core is not tampered. We are all aware of this basic principle. It is the same for human life. What is the significant goal of a human life? We must work in a manner acceptable to the command of Na:ra:yana (the Lord), who brought us here in the first place. We must work as service to Him. We must work on our activities when not in conflict with this thought. We must direct all areas of our work focusing on this goal.\nIn reality, we have bodily comforts to stay focused [on the goal]. We have comforts for the indriya:s (senses) to stay focused [on the goal]. We have mental comforts to stay focused [on the goal]. We have intellectual comforts to refrain from deviating from [focus on the goal]. All these comforts were established in this world so as not to tamper with our focus on the goal. This means, everything including bho:ga upakarana:s (things which support us to experience luxuries), bho:ga sthana:s (places of luxuries), and bho:gams (luxuries), are all created for that [Goal]. They are not created for their own sake. To ensure a little kid gets a good education, he is admitted into a good [residential] school. So that he studies well, they accommodate him with a nice room. They provide a nice bed, A/C, TV, and crayons. They provide good food and beverages. They give all these [comforts] to support the studying of the child. Would the parents or providers be satisfied if he simply enjoyed the comforts and ignored the actual study? No, right? Why did they provide all these? To ensure that he studies well and graduates with flying colors. That is the highest priority. These comforts will never go away; they are always there. However, these are not important. That [goal] is the most important.\nFor a human being, it is important to identify the ultimate goal and work accordingly. To do that, a focused mind is required. Let’s say, an overhead water tank is filled with water. If it has 100 taps, water flows through all 100 taps but each tap might get only a trickle. If we close all the taps except one, then water flows in that one tap with great pressure. The same goes for our thoughts. It is our responsibility to focus on one thing rather than drifting to several. That is called vyavasa:ya:thmika (focused) budhdhi (intellect). Assume our mental faculty is distributed among so many other desires. In fact, if you perform your actions without letting your mind wander on everything else, the results relating to all those other aspects will come anyway. However, if we let our minds wander to these other things, the primary goal will suffer. The people around us in society try to divert our focus. They shape their words accordingly. As a result, we are cheated. For example, we hear, “Please use this toothpaste. We promise that your teeth will never have any issues.” The teeth need to exist to have any issues in the first place, right? Meaning, that toothpaste will result in you losing all your teeth. “Please use this oil. You will never have any issues with your hair. You will never have to consult a doctor ever again.” [By using that oil] since there will not be any hair left, you will never have to consult anyone anymore! All these dialogues are good to hear. These are like pushiptha:m va:cham (flowery words). The dialogues are as attractive as bouquets of blooming flowers. Why do flowers bloom? Flowers grow on trees - for what purpose? Their purpose is to develop into a fruit, ripen, and then become the seed of another tree. However, some flowers are not like that. They grow beautifully, but they do not yield any fruits. They just fall along with leaves. One example - pomegranate flowers. There are two types of pomegranates. One type has a small flower that yields fruit. Some trees yield only big flowers but no fruits. These flowers are so attractive, red and beautifully bunched. However, they are limited to only flowers, without yielding any fruits. They are useful simply to arrange as decoration, without any benefit [of fruit]. Some people’s words are also like that. Materialistically they baffle us, “Spend on this, invest in that, do this and do that...” We have heard about many such people. There are many who have been fooled by these people, giving their life savings in the hope of going to U.S., Canada, or elsewhere. Their words are so attractive. Of course, that is the marketing strategy. Like this, some people… \npushpitha:m va:cham pravadhanthi (speak in flowery words) \nWhat do we call them? Avipaschithaha (those lacking clarity). They lack clarity of how things work. Those with clarity are called vipaschith (those with understanding). Vipaschith means vidwa:n vipaschith doshajnaha (an educated one). For his mind - vividham pasyathi chiththam e:sha:m (he sees things clearly). He is vipaschithaha. The term vipaschith refers to someone who has comprehensive knowledge. In other words, he knows how something works, what spoils it, its faults, and its benefits. If he has good knowledge about the item, it is clear to him what’s acceptable vs. what’s to be rejected with regard to it. Only people who are knowledgeable about the item can determine if something is acceptable or not. Hence vividham pasyathi chiththam, the one who understands it holistically, …the one with knowledge of what’s acceptable and not acceptable, …the one capable of identifying faults in something that may threaten his goal, …the one who becomes do:sha:jnaha (knowledgeable about faults), he is vipaschith. He is vidwa:n. If you are vidwa:n, vyavasa:ya:thmika budhdhi naturally exists and the goal is naturally set. There are people called avipaschithas, who surround him [vidwa:n] and tamper with his goal. What do they do? The way they speak makes us believe that they are telling the truth. There have been recent reports of people who watch certain movies and TV shows, ultimately killing themselves or others. That means those words [from the movies and TV shows] had a significant impact on them. We recently also heard of those who tortured their kids, doing all kinds of horrible things, and killing them. All because of the impact of the words of those influencing them. What do they do? As long as they receive the benefit, it does not matter whether he lives or dies. That’s all. Selfish people talk in different ways to tamper with our goals. Don’t succumb to their words. You need the support of the Wise who establish the goal so as not to succumb to the [“pleasing”] words. “Be aware!”, says Sri Krishna. They also demonstrate several references from authority, and also prove them. They speak as if there is nothing else in the world other than that. \nya:mima:m pushpitha:m va:cham pravadanthi: (they speak in flowery words) \npravadanthi, they speak in exaggeration. \navipaschithaha, they have no validity. \nIt is only their own benefit which matters to them. \nve:dava:daratha:ha pa:rttha! na:nyad asthi:thi va:dinaha (O Partha, those who say there is nothing else) \nThey keep arguing. What matters to them is the satisfaction of their selfish needs, regardless of others or their families. \nka:ma:thma:naha svargapara:ha (those who are driven by desires are heaven-bound) \njanma karma phalaprada:m (the results of their actions lead to your downfall). \nAdditionally, it is physically strenuous. Many people today believe that physical exertion is the key to success. When you recommend working with the brain, they believe that it is not difficult enough. If a doctor recommends us to do yoga, pra:na:ya:ma (breathing exercises), a good diet, and drink ka:sha:ya (herbal decoction), amber, daily… so that, “you will then be disease-free.” One will react, “What kind of doctor is he?!” However, if that doctor admits one into a hospital, collects one lakh every day, pokes with ten different types of injections, …installs a ventilator, provides canned oxygen, …even if the patient ultimately dies, …one claims, “Wow! What a great doctor! What a great doctor!” The doctor becomes famous and prestigious. Unfortunately, people today tend to believe that the more physically strenuous, the better! Most people forget that the judicious use of the mind plays a significant role in how well the body cooperates. \nkriya: vise:sha bahula:m (actions focused on temporary results) \nTheir primary focus is on temporary wealth, results, and comforts. For such people, there is no mental focus. \nvyavasa:ya:thmika: buddhihi sama:dhou na vidhi:yathe (it’s impossible for them to concentrate, and they will continue to lose their way). This is materialistic life. It’s similar in Ve:dic life as well. Ve:da:s also show us several [temporary] results. If we strive for those, we will continue to swirl in the cycle of birth and death. If we live our lives focusing on God, as His command, as His service - we will be freed from the shackles of karma. This is what God is teaching us in chapter 2. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 103,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is a scripture related to practice. We need to know what to practice and secondly, what to implement in our lives. Knowledge of something is theory. Its implementation in our lives is called practice. We need them both. We need to first know, followed by practice. Practice was demonstrated first. Later it was documented. Sri Ramayana is a scripture of practice. Bhagavad Gita is a theoretical text. The different concepts are described here (in Bhagavad Gita). They are demonstrated (by the wise) in that (Sri Ramayana).\nHuman life should be led by focusing on a noble and the best goal, ignoring the intermediary trivial results. It is important to move towards that (goal) not being held back by any trivial results. This is the message in the second chapter. Sri Krishna is trying to convey this to Arjuna and ensure he comprehends it. Initially, when Arjuna denied waging the war, He (Sri Krishna) could have simply commanded him to fight, but he chose not to do that. Arjuna was in sorrow. It had to be eliminated. Sorrow is temporary.\nWhen they (Pandavas) had to stay in the forest for 12 years and live incognito for a year, they went through a lot of hardships. They decided to win back their kingdom even if they had to wage a war. Even during the negotiations, they discussed the same. When they were going through hardships, they were determined to win back their kingdom. 12 + 1, 13 years were spent, negotiations were complete (unsuccessfully). The preparations for war were complete. Everyone had assembled. Now Arjuna doesn’t want to fight. Why? All the folks around him looked like kith and kin. He felt, “What am I going to accomplish by killing all of them?” He decided that he didn’t want to gain the kingdom by killing his family in the war.\nIn reality, what is more important, gaining the kingdom or taking on responsibility? He (Arjuna) is a king. He belongs to a dynasty of rulers, and he also has the responsibility of ruling the kingdom. For such a person, it is his responsibility to rule the kingdom and remove any faults in the administration. As part of removing those faults, he might receive praise, blame, gains, or loss. Today, we are witnessing some incidents. The rulers want people to be happy and healthy, so they enforce certain rules. Some (rules) are commended and some are criticized. Regardless, the ideal ruler should not and will not be swayed. When he is commended, he doesn’t jump up and down arrogantly. It is natural that someone or the other will blame the ruler. He might get criticized at the assembly or through other means such as mass media. However, they (ideal rulers) don’t focus on that. They have a goal to rule the kingdom in a certain way. They just go towards that goal. That’s all. Whatever is required, they continue to do it and move forward. Regardless of the favorable or unfavorable experiences, they do not and should not focus on them. This is the message Sri Krishna is intending to convey.\n“Since you are the ruler, your ultimate goal is the well-being of the people.” You are entrusted with that responsibility. Without desiring it, you are now required to wage war. You have an opportunity to punish those committing mistakes. A punishment should not be based on whether he feels bad or you feel bad, or whether he will be at a loss, or you will be at a loss. You need not look into all these. Whatever you must do, you should continue to do it. Your responsibility is only to fulfill your duty, and it is not right to evaluate the profit and loss. This is what a human being should know. A responsible person knows this. Even Arjuna knows this. Because he lived in those times (Dvapara Yuga), he might have already been aware of this. However, sometimes, he succumbs to the impact of the circumstances. Despite the person being wise, sometimes, he succumbs to despair and gets into trouble. Arjuna is also faced with a similar situation. This needs to be eliminated. Arjuna needs to be transformed into a duty-oriented person.\nA human being is only given an opportunity of human life to perform his duties. To get a human life, a subset of karma (action) is chosen, and a body is provided. This is done by someone - call it God, Nature, etc. From the moment the jiva (individual soul) begins his journey at the stage of a cell, whatever is to be done in that body is already perfectly programmed. Progressively, he collects everything which is required to accomplish his tasks, grows his body, and emerges. After that, he eats and (the body he resides in) grows. What he needs to do is, he needs to eat food that supports the execution of all his karmic records. He needs to establish an environment relevant to that state. However, he is not aware of that karmic record. Based on his birth, his karma is predetermined. Sometimes as part of the journey, he faces certain situations and continues to move forward. Today, Arjuna’s responsibility is to wage war. Initially, they did whatever they had to do but now they are ready for the war.\nWhat happens if you do what needs to be done? Whatever karma was allocated to you for this body gets reduced. Your burden (of karma) reduces. If you are able to do your job properly following the right process, not only does it remove the karma, which is assigned specifically to this body, it also removes the karma which is stored in the backlog. Scriptures say that only a human has the capability to do this. That’s why our elders said, “durlabho manusho dehaḥ” (rare is the human body). For animals and other beings, they do what they must do and eliminate the karma specific to only that body. Done. The case closes there. That’s not the case for humans. They not only can eliminate karma specific to this body, but also can eliminate karma stored in their backlog on performing their duties.\nWhat is the process? You need to know how you have arrived, and who you are. We are humans. What does human mean? Human means 1) body, 2) indwelling jiva (soul) which ‘lives’ through the body. Learn about these two. Learn about jiva and engage the body in work. When you engage the body in work, there may be favorable and unfavorable conditions. Be patient. Lord started the second chapter by preaching tolerance. He started by saying, “tān tiṣṭhīkṣasva bhārata” (be patient, O Bharata). You must also listen to this with patience. That’s why we have started this. We also need some patience to listen and understand this concept. We have arrived at the current state because of several crores (millions) of births. How is it possible to understand the summary within 5 minutes? That’s why we need some patience and some critical thinking. We need to listen, we need to repeat it in our minds, and we need to practice it constantly. This is called anusmṛti (remembrance). Only then will we be able to perform what we need to perform and achieve what we need to achieve.\nHe began Bhagavad Gita by describing ātma (soul). We discussed that a human has two parts. One is a soul, which is invisible and runs the body, and the second one is the visible body. Let’s say this body is hardware and the soul is software. The software is not visible. We can only see the hardware. They are useful only if they work together. Otherwise, they are not useful. He (Sri Krishna) preached about software initially. It is called saṅkhya buddhi (knowledge-based intelligence). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\neṣa te'pi hitaḥ saṅkhye buddhiḥ\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is your knowledge-based intelligence.\n-----------------------------------------------\nNow, He also needs to preach about yogic intelligence (yoga buddhi). It is nothing but preparing the hardware to use the software. Let’s say the software is very powerful but hardware is a low-end model. If you install the latest software needing terabytes in an old 1980s computer with a capacity of 10-15 megabytes… Something requires terabytes and this is configured for megabytes, how will it function? We need to upgrade the hardware accordingly. (In humans) This upgradation is called yoga (union). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyogetu imāṁ śṛṇu\nSLOKA MEANING -\nListen carefully.\n-----------------------------------------------\nyoge buddhiḥ yathā bhavati aham tat vakṣyāmi śṛṇu avahiṭhaḥ manaḥ\n“I told you about ātma, now I will tell you about how to perform the work with this body - and how to leverage the knowledge from this ātma.” Thus, He started preaching this in the second chapter, followed by the concept of samatvaṁ (equanimity). As we work, we will encounter ups and downs. What should we do? We should accept them both equally. Accept both profit and loss. Accept the loss just the way you would accept the profit. Or reject the profit just the way you would reject the loss. It’s okay either way. This is called yoga.\nThis is not easy to practice unless one has - buddhi kuśalatā (skillful mind). In verse 2.50 He says,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbuddhiyukto jāhāti ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever is equipoised by results of profit or loss,\n-----------------------------------------------\nubhe sukhṛta duṣkṛteḥ\nonly he is considered an intelligent one, who has a skillful mind. What should we do with the results? This needs to be specified. From verse 2.51 onwards, He explains the procedure to do the work, and what to expect while doing it. It is important to properly use the body and ātma. This is the essence of Bhagavad Gita. He moves forward and further clarifies this concept. Let us move forward as well and try to understand it. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), For a human, is it important to evaluate profit and loss? Or to ensure that they are performing their duty? When a teacher is teaching students in a school, is it important to evaluate who received what score? Or is it important to ensure that the lessons were properly taught, following the right process? If it is of utmost importance to the teacher that the students receive an A grade, like those big institutes where they fine-tune the appropriate faculty and system so that all their students get A+ grades… Some institutes guarantee A+ to the students. How can they guarantee that? It means they have a pre-defined process regardless of the efforts of the student. Isn’t it? It is not important if the student has received A+ or not. Did you properly teach the students? This should be more important.\nThere are two types. Firstly, properly prepare by comprehending the content, leverage all the necessary probes and equipment, get down to their level, and teach to ensure the students’ comprehension. Secondly, if the students are not able to comprehend, apply different strategies such as analysis, explanation by providing examples, facilitation of extensive practice, etc. to ensure they understand. Both need to exist. Along with appropriate teaching methods, it is important to understand each student's abilities, prepare, and deliver the lesson accordingly. Delivering the lesson is important. Beyond that, it is not the responsibility of the teacher as to what grade the student has received or what he is going to do with that knowledge. The primary duty is to properly teach the subject.\nSimilarly, for every human, the primary duty is to perform responsibilities. In Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna lost interest in performing duties. Everyone was assembled and ready to wage war. His duty was to wage war well. Dharmaraja (Yudhishthira) knows about this. We may think Bhima is a little aggressive, Nakula and Sahadeva are still kids and immature. However, Dharmaraja is called the icon of dharma (righteousness). He didn’t have any doubts about whether to wage war or not. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:cha:rya:h pitharah puthra\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAll of these are my kith and kin, should I kill them?\n-----------------------------------------------\nShould I eat the blood-tainted food? How come he (Dharmaraja) didn’t have any such doubts? It was very clear to him. Only Arjuna had these doubts which is why he was a good representative for all of us. What do we do? We always evaluate profit and loss, yet… never retrospect about how well we are performing our duties. Should we not care about profits, and shouldn’t we avoid loss? Is it okay even if we experience loss? Is it bad to anticipate profit? These questions might arise. None of these are wrong. But stopping there is wrong. Without stopping there, continue to do your duty and go ahead. That’s all! That’s what you need to do.\nHow did Arjuna react? “What happens if we kill them?” “How can I enjoy the kingdom later? I might go to hell or heaven.” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthrailo:kya ra:jya se:hithoho kinmahi:kruthe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhy do you need all these questions? It is your responsibility to wage war, just do it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou might go to heaven or hell or might not get any result. Only someone with a proper mind will be able to perform responsibilities. So become one. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nto:gah karmasu kousalam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAchieving yoga (union with the divine) is not easy; it is only possible for a wise person with perseverance.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat happens if you do that? We discussed this previously. Our karma (actions) specific to current birth will be eliminated, as well as all our previous karma, and we will no longer be forced to enter this filthy pit. This is the goal of our life. What is the point in continually falling into this filthy pit and getting back up again and again? This should be our ultimate goal in life. We need to be in a state which does not bring us back to this murky abyss and eliminates the underlying cause, karma, records of past actions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nSri Krushna called it ana:mayam padam in verse 2.51.\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe healthy state (free from disease) is the ultimate goal.\n-----------------------------------------------\nkarmajam buddhiyuktha: hi phalam thyakthva: mani:shinaha | \njanmabandha vinirmuktha:ha padam gachchanthy ana:mayam ||\nana:mayam padam gachchanthy\na:mayam (disease) means disease; ana:mayam (free from disease) means to be free of diseases, healthy. The term disease doesn’t have to be just limited to the illness of the body; it also means the existence of ups and downs. Dying, being born, again dying, and again being born, and so on. The permanent, happy place is called padam (state) [where there is no birth and death cycle]. Whoever performs their duties in this [recommended] fashion will go there.\nHow can they go there when they are in sorrow here? \njanmabandha vinirmuktha:ha\njanma (rebirth) from re-birth; bandha (bondage) from the accumulation of new karma and increasing the attachment to karma. Meaning, there is no need to be in a womb, no need to be born again, no need to add any more karma. \nmuktha:ha (released) not just that… \nnirmuktha:ha (properly released) to a state where they will never be bound to it again; \nvinirmuktha:ha (fully released) to the best state, such that there is never a need to return ever again.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthad vishno:h param padam svo:dhana pa:rama:pno:thi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYama Dharmaraja says this in Kato:panishad. He will go through this path and attain the state.\n-----------------------------------------------\nvishno:h padam pra:pno:thi\nSri Krushna is clarifying this to us. \njanmabandha vinirmuktha:ha padam gachchanthy ana:mayam ||\nWhat should be done for it? \nkarmajam phalam thyakthva: \nresults arising from performing duties should be renounced. What is this? We should do the work and let go of the results! Does anyone even work if they know they are not going to enjoy the results? Does anyone even feel like working if they must let go of the results? That is why it is said mani:shinaha, \nmani:sha (good mind) is that intellect which is properly mature. The one who has it is called mani:shi. The one who is normally born is called manishi. But if he possesses this matured intelligence, he becomes mani:shi, with a long vowel. What do these mani:shis, highly matured intelligent people do? They possess the yoga (union) buddhi (intellect) which we discussed earlier. \nkarmajam phalam thyajanthi: \nThey will renounce the results from the duties they perform. We claim, “we don’t even want to do anything if we don’t get results.” Sri Krushna says, “If that’s the case, then expect the results, but not the minor ones. Whatever you wish for, ask for the best.” \nIf someone who has 100 crores gives you a blank check, then what do you do? You may ask, “How much should I write?” He will say, “You can write as much as you wish.” Will any intelligent person write 1 rupee? If someone gives you a check and says there are 100 crores in the bank, you can take as much as you want. Then what should you do? You may leave 1 or 2 crores to him, and you can write a check for 98 crores! Whatever you do, go for the best, and wish for the greatest one!\nIf a king asks you what you wish for, who asks for a broomstick or simple clothes to wear? So, whatever you wish for, do not wish for meager results. Wish for great results. One day a king was surprised by a kid who had renounced everything. The kid was an educated one, living in a hermitage and performing service. The king said, “What a great intellect you have. You have renounced everything and are a great hermit!” The kid smiled and said, ”You are a better hermit than I!”\nThe king said, “You are the one who renounced everything. How can I become a greater hermit?” The kid said, “Someone is given a choice to pick either 5 or 1000. If they pick 5 and leave 1000, what do we call him? We call him innocent, right?” Similarly, here there are two things to obtain: Body and Soul. The body is the one that can succumb to diseases and be destroyed. No matter how hard you try, it won’t stay. Like how we noticed during Covid. In spite of the best efforts of doctors and patients, and no matter how much money was spent, people were dying. A body is something which is temporary. The happiness and sorrow related to the body are also temporary. The experiences with the body are also temporary. All the luxuries like cars and buildings you earn for are also of the same nature. \nWhich is greater, these or the soul? The soul is greater. You wish for all luxuries, buildings, money, the happiness from these experiences… and renounce the soul. These are all valid only if the soul exists. You can’t take anything with you. All the hard-earned things have to be left here. The soul is valuable and these [material things] are not. Still, you are focusing on these and leaving the soul. How great you are! Based on the guidance from the scriptures and my guru, since these are all meager, I am wishing for something with greater value. I am renouncing meager things and you are renouncing the most valuable one, “...so you are the real hermit, not I.”\nWe are also like that king. What should be renounced and what should be held on to? We need to hold the soul and leave the paltry things. If you are not able to leave anything, if you think you are unable to leave the results of the karma, don’t do it. Wish for a great result, not a small one. Wish for the greatest one which is permanent and blissful. Don’t wish for the result which comes out of karma. Wish for something which is permanent. If you wish for that, then this doesn’t bind you. You can become janmabandha vinirmuktha:ha (released from the cycle of rebirth). You can achieve the state of ana:maya (free from disease). Sri Krushna clarifies this in verse 2.51. He is preaching to us the process of [right way of] wishing [for results]. Let’s move forward while learning about this. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), What is the right way to use the human body? And why? These two things are clearly explained by Sri Krishna to Arjuna in Bhagavad Gita verse 2.51.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarmajam buddhiyuktha:ha phalam thyajanthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOnly those who think properly are able to wish for the better and best results.\n-----------------------------------------------\nOthers wish for meager benefits, attaining intermediate results and settle there. This is what He [Sri Krishna] said. We need to remember two things here. When we are working on something, there are two types of results: drushta phalitha (immediate results) and adrushta phalitha (long-term results). Should we wish for drushta phalitha or adrushta phalitha? \nWhat are those? Here are a few examples. Drushta phalitha means… say you are eating something, it is tasty for your tongue. It has a pleasing color. You will feel, “Ah! This is good.” This is called drushta phalitha. However, two days after you eat it, suppose it causes a burning sensation in your stomach or even causes ulcers. What do we call it? Adrushta phalitha. Drushta phalitha was good but adrushta phalitha is horrible.\nFor those who smoke, drink, or take narcotics, while taking them, it feels great - literally heavenly. This temporary happiness is drushta phalitha. This feels good. What is the outcome? Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, or next year or the year after, or when he gets old… It puts him in a dangerous state, but you can’t foresee that, right? That is adrushta phalitha. Whatever made him happy at that moment is drushta phalitha. \nShould we focus on this [drushta phalitha] or that [adrushta phalitha]? There are some people who are walking, jogging, or running in the morning. Temporarily, it is inconvenient. You get fatigued, perspire, and feel tired. [But] Because of this, he remains active the entire day. When someone does this every day and misses a day, he feels dull and lethargic. Doing this [exercise] will protect him from getting ill in the future and bestows upon him good health. Future good health is adrushta because you can’t see it. \nToday you see perspiration and [feel] tiredness. Are you going to ruin your future health by giving in to today's fatigue? Will you ruin tomorrow’s health by sitting around, eating, and enjoying temporary happiness today? This is drushta and that is adrushta. When we recognize the adrushta phalitha, even if there are temporary conveniences or inconveniences, we bear with them patiently knowing the activity is ultimately beneficial for us.\nWhen a fisherman goes to the ocean, he finds stones, etc. on the surface. They are beautiful and can be sold at a good price. However, if he goes a little deeper, he can find prawns, etc. They have a higher price. If he goes still deeper, he can find jades, corals, and other precious jewels. These are even more expensive. If he goes even deeper, he can tap oils or other unknown valuables. There are many such benefits there. \nWill you settle for shells and rocks at the surface rather than the precious deeper treasures? Or will you ignore the ones on the surface to achieve the ones which are deeper? The ones which are available in the deep sea are adrushta, and the ones which are externally visible are drushta. If you focus on adrushta and work towards them, then you will acquire both. But if you focus only on the drushta, then you will never achieve adrushta.\nHuman beings are the same. There is a soul inside the body. Is it more important to have a happy soul or a happy body? If you want your body to be happy, you can eat, drink, play, and live in different ways. This will give temporary happiness to the body. By doing exercises, your body will be happy a few days more, give or take. However, regardless of what you do, the body is not permanent and is perishable. \nNot just the human body, “a:bramha bhuvana:loka:ha punara:varthinaha Arjuna” declared Sri Krishna in chapter 8. Not just here, there are other worlds that are beyond the understanding of science. There are worlds of Indra, Varuna, Brahma, and many others. They are all higher. The topmost one is Brahma’s world. Even if one travels with great difficulty to the highest of worlds, Brahma’s abode… He must inevitably come back.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npa:thayishnu\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is inevitable for him to come back.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDo you wish for that, or do you want to wish for something eternal? A:thma pra:pthi (attaining self), is that which once achieved is imperishable. Or bhagavath pra:pthi (attaining God) is imperishable. You should wish for either one. Do you want something which is imperishable and permanent, or temporary? Do you want drushta or adrushta? If there is a guarantee that we will achieve adrushta, then we can let go of drushta. Is there a guarantee? \nSri Krishna declares this guarantee. We need to recognize that. We might say, “You are asking us to leave that which is present here.” We might neither get this nor that. We might lose both and feel bad. We don’t want to be in that situation, right? True. If you focus on drushta, then adrushta will be lost. However, if you focus on adrushta, you will attain drushta as well! Drushta will not be lost. You will attain drushta as well! We need to remember this important aspect. \nIf we focus on the soul, we will get everything here as well. However, if you focus only on these [temporary benefits], then the final desirable [eternal] soul will be lost. God is giving a guarantee that we will achieve these [temporary benefits]. We might ask, “What’s the assurance that we will attain that?” There is a leaf insect that walks with two feet in the front and two feet in the back. It doesn’t land anywhere in the middle. Once it comes to an edge, it checks for support. Only if it ensures that there is support for it in the front will it not let go of its legs behind. \nWe behave similarly. Aren’t we smarter than an insect? If a:thma pra:pthi is definite… If there is a guarantee that it can be attained… If there is assurance, then we will let go of these meager results. We will wish for great results. We will have an opportunity to say that. However, do we have it [guarantee]? If we sow a seed, a tree will grow and then yield fruits. If we observe the existing trees, we know that fact. One will sow the seed instead of eating it, knowing that it will grow like the tree beside it. \nDo we have any guarantee like that? Yes! Sa:sathra:s (scriptures), and ithiha:sas (history) are talking about it. Sri Krishna Himself is giving us assurance.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npadam gachchanthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever performs his duty focusing on the soul, he will certainly attain such a state.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThen tell us quickly what we should do. As said earlier... \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarmajam phala tya:gam, buddhiyuktha:ha thyajanthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTry to enhance the buddhi (intellect), mind.\n-----------------------------------------------\nShouldn’t we be working towards enhancing that which reaps us lasting benefits? How much should it be enhanced? If there is darkness in a room, how much light is required? So much that it removes all the darkness. Let’s say there is a big hall of hundreds of square feet. If you just light a matchstick, is it enough? There are two things, buddhi (intellect) and moha (ignorance). Think about what should be enhanced. Should buddhi be enhanced or moha be enhanced? \nIf you want to enhance moha, focus on temporary things. If you want to enhance buddhi, focus on the permanent things. It’s not possible to have both. We need to remember this. You can have either - that is your choice. Enhance the lamp and expand the light. Light more lamps, one after the other - In such a way that the darkness disappears. If you don’t try to expand the light, the darkness spreads. It’s the same within us. Currently, moha is spread within us. Moha means ignorance. Desire for other things - the longing to experience them. The focus is on the beauty of those things. \nThis is what is in our buddhi now. We need to cleanse our buddhi, eliminate it [moha], show the permanent result to it, state its greatness, and enhance buddhi in such a way that it will act towards that. This needs to be done. How well you do this relates to how well the lamp is lit. When the lamp is properly lit, ignorance will automatically depart. This is what Sri Krishna mentions in verse 2.52.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyada: the: mo:hakalilam buddhir vyathi tharishyathi |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe buddhi that you had previously filled with temporary things, murky with moha,\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen you have started to filter out moha from the polluted buddhi, When it has started to become clean getting rid of moha… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthada: gantha:si nirve:dam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThen a type of sorrow develops within, a type of regret grows.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThinking you could have achieved so much but didn’t. Despite being given such a great opportunity, you have lost it. This type of deep repentance is called nirvedam (regret). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthada: gantha:si nirve:dam\nSLOKA MEANING -\n[nirvedam] for what?\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsro:thavyasya sruthasya cha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou will experience nirvedam for both, what you spent time hearing about and what you ought to have heard.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna directs Arjuna on the path of following his duty in this way. Let us also travel along with him. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), in chapter 2 of Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna discusses the ideal state of one's buddhi (intellect). The Lord is addressing people who desire to strengthen their intellect. How should you enhance your buddhi? You must enhance it through yoga. You must enhance it as yoga. He says, karmasu kau:salam (performing duties as yoga is for the wise).\nWhat does it mean to have good buddhi (intellect)? What is the way to possess it? In fact, why is it even necessary? Buddhi is like a lamp (di:pam). For someone in a dark room, if they need to move about and do activities, they need a lamp, right? If they desire to know the objects around properly, they need to increase the brightness of the lamp. That’s what we are desiring.\nLet’s take a more obvious example. For someone who was COVID positive and in the hospital, what did people consider most essential in recent days? Why did they want to book a hospital bed? Why did they get so scared of the second wave? Oxygen. They made many attempts to procure it and blamed the government in various ways. The governments worked very hard to procure it and make it available to all. They are also advising to start preparing for the next wave and to ensure oxygen is universally available. Oxygen is essential. If you want to stay in this body, oxygen is needed. Ensure O2 levels are at least 95 when infected with COVID. What would happen if it dropped below? People have bought specific meters (pulse oximeters) for that purpose. The demand for them has increased tremendously. Every few minutes, they check their oxygen level using them. Is it at 85, 96, or reaching 100? Why? Because a reading above 96 indicates we are fine and can live comfortably. If that level goes down, then we may die any minute. Isn’t that so? This is the reality we all confronted recently. Hence, we took that as an example.\nThis is a visible example. Based on this, we will tell you about something intangible. While we are in this body, what is the ‘meter’ we should check? Are we performing our activities with our mind set on the highest goal or not? Are we doing them without focusing on temporary results? That is samathva buddhi (equanimous mind). Are we enhancing samathva buddhi or not? Having an equanimous mind is what having buddhi means. Thinking, “I know this. I know that. I read this. I read that.” That is not buddhi. The more samathva buddhi one has, the wiser they become. When samathva buddhi wanes, moha (delusion) grows. The more that moha grows, the more the samathva buddhi diminishes. Intellect continues to exist, but it runs behind temporary results. If it goes in that direction, it is analogous to oxygen dropping below 80. If samathva buddhi increases and moha decreases, it is analogous to oxygen increasing above 96. So simple! Try to enhance samathva buddhi, an equanimous mind.\nWhen will it increase? Sri Krishna is saying in verse 2.52 that first you need to have a sense of nirveda (regret). Nirveda is that sadness resulting from not attaining what has to be attained and what is rightfully yours, even when there is a chance to attain it. It is similar to the situation when someone’s oxygen is falling below 88, despite having an oxygen cylinder and mask nearby. With readily available oxygen, he can make use of the mask but doesn’t put it on. He struggles for breath with a working mask in hand. He can simply wear it. He doesn't put it on and is struggling for breath. If someone puts it on him, he will be so relieved. Then he will feel, ‘Alas! I should have put it on earlier, I should have known.’ That is nirveda or atma ninda (self-criticism). Blaming oneself for not attaining what is worthy is nirveda.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyada:the mo:ha kalilam buddihi vyathi tharishyathihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen the intellect can gradually come out of this sheath of delusion, improper attachment.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThen you will feel nirveda. Why does one feel nirveda, despair? Because we didn’t pay heed to that tathva (reality) and the benefits of it which were worthy of knowing. Previously, we had an opportunity to recognize both [tathva and body]. “However, instead of recognizing this tathva, I am getting attached to that which degrades me and causes suffering.” “Alas! I wasted so much time.” You would feel that, right?\nThey say that for a devotee, there is no sleep. This is a different context. Why is there no sleep for him? Once you know about God, there is no sleep. Why? Once you understand God and reach Him, one will continuously be absorbed in the exquisite beauty of the Lord. It seems his eyes will not blink. There are a few games that have been released recently. If kids start playing them, it seems they forget to eat or sleep, and even their surroundings. Wherever he is, he is only focused on the game. We are talking about a small game here. However, if a man can reach God and see Him, looking at the Lord’s exquisite beauty, he won’t be able to turn his eyes away and will not be willing to even blink his eyes. Hence, he will have no sleep there.\nWhy does he [a devotee] have no sleep in the other case? Here, after knowing about that great tathva (eternal truth), he feels, “I still didn’t attain it. I should have attained it long ago.” “Despite having the opportunity, I am unable to attain it.” Pining for it this way, he won’t be able to sleep. Hence, lack of sleep is always there in both cases for a devotee. They say this in jest.\nWhoever pays attention to that tathva properly, whose intellect matures properly, for such a person, when he wants to get out of this dirt of moha (ignorance), he regrets - ‘I did not hear the upadesas (teachings) about this from the Wise, though they were accessible to me. I wasted so much time.’ What we have to attain is ours. It is the jiva’s (soul’s) right to attain it. God is the one who is naturally related to us and who will help us attain it. Once we know this, we feel, ‘why didn’t I attain it still?’. With this deep longing in the heart, the feeling is nirveda.\nHence, srothavyasya shruthasya (about what should be heard and what has already been heard), he feels sad about ignoring what he should have listened to. The more he feels nirveda, or regret, the more he can assimilate the topics [about tathva]. The dryer an object gets, the easier it is to grind it into powder. The more he feels nirveda and deep longing, the more he can assimilate certain topics about what he has to attain [i.e. tathva]. This is what the Lord tells us in verse 2.52. One should feel nirveda first.\nHowever, a lot of people say we should not have atma nirveda (self-regret), but should have self-confidence. If we know what atma is, who it belongs to, and its nature, then it is good to have confidence in it. That is the higher goal which we discussed previously. We should focus our attention on that big goal. We should have attained it long back. However, we couldn't attain it for millions of lives, and in this life also, we are away from it. Then how can we not feel nirveda? We should feel it.\nThere is a short funny story. There was a priest in the olden days, when there were no online pujas. He went to a house for puja. He loved ‘old’ jaggery. The lady of the house put half a kg of ‘old’ jaggery among the puja items. After finishing the puja, he told his young disciple to bag the old jaggery. However, before the disciple could pack it, a pet dog that was untied took the jaggery. The priest was furious and hit the young disciple, who started crying. The lady of the house enquired why he was crying. \n[Lady] Why did you hit him?  \n[Priest] Look, he didn’t pack the jaggery.  \nThe lady thought that the priest liked jaggery and so she got him more. \n[Lady] You only lost half a kg; I will give you one full kg.  \nAfter taking it, the priest hit the disciple again. \n[Priest] Stupid boy, if that half kg was there, it would have been 1.5 kg!  \n[Lady] Why are you hitting him for this simple reason? If you want, I will give you one more kg.  \nSo, she brought him another kg. The priest hit the boy again. \n[Priest] If you didn’t miss the initial, it would have been 2.5 kgs by now!  \nEven if the lady offered 100 kgs, he would lament that it would have been 100.5 kgs! Because of the longing to gain the other piece, however much he gets, he won’t be satisfied. This is negativity. \nHowever, from the positive angle, once he hears about atma tathva (soul truth), and wants to attain it, and when intellect develops accordingly, he regrets that he had wasted his intellect on mundane topics, feeling, ‘why did I focus on these? Why did I act on these? Why couldn’t I hear about [atma]? Why didn’t I act towards that? Why did I lose it, being so far off?’ That regret will always make him feel nirveda.\nWith this nirveda only, manas (mind) becomes mature. Once manas matures, it can facilitate clear understanding of what needs to be known. What is it that he should understand and how should he understand it? Sri Krishna begins to elaborate on this. Let’s try to listen. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In Bhagavad Gita verse 2.52, Sri Krishna gave us a good method, nirveda (regret). With nirveda, you will attain yoga (union). \nIf someone asked a question to a person who thinks he knows everything, and if that person couldn’t answer properly, he feels, “Alas! I have studied for so long and thought I knew everything.” If he feels that regret in his heart, he will try to learn about that topic thoroughly. We have many examples like this. \nFor someone who thinks he can do anything, when unable to even move a blade of grass, the resulting sorrow in him is called nirveda. Once, all the de:vathas (celestial beings) were each thinking… ‘There is no one greater than I. I waged war! I have killed all these a:suras (demons).’ All the de:vathas, including Agni (fire), Va:yu (air), Varuna (rain), and Indra (king of de:vathas), started boasting about themselves. \nThe war had just concluded. Lord Vishnu had helped them win. As soon as they won, they started boasting about themselves. Lord Vishnu felt sorry for them and felt it essential to teach them a lesson on a:thma jna:na (self-knowledge). Lord Vishnu became a radiant beam of light in the sky, known as Yakshaha. Thus, he was glowing in the form of yaksha (a celestial being). The celestial beings were unable to understand what that was. \nSince Agni was the youngest of all, Indra called Agni. He instructed, ‘Hey Agni, go and find out who this yaksha is.’ Agni went to the yaksha and asked arrogantly, ‘Who are you?’ \n[Yaksha] I will tell who I am, but first tell me who you are. \n[Agni] You don’t know who I am when you look at me? \nagnir va:ha:r aham asmi ja:tha ve:da va aham asmi (I am always radiating heat. Not only that, I can burn down anything.) \n[Yaksha] Oh, you have such great power? \n[Agni] Of course. Why is there any doubt? \n[Yaksha] That’s nice. Please burn this small blade of grass. \nThe yaksha put a small blade of grass in front of him. \nthad upapreya:ya sarvaja ve:natham nasa sha:kha dhagdhum (Try to burn this blade of grass.) \nAgni tried with all his might, but couldn’t even fade the green color of the grass. He hung his head in shame. Until then, he was sitting with others and proclaiming, ‘All this is because of me. I am great. Our victory is because of me.’ The one who had been boasting like this until now, how could he face them? Hence, sathatha e:va nivavruthe (he went and sat somewhere in the back), hiding from the others. \nIndra wondered why Agni hadn't returned after such a long time. He called Va:yu to find out about the yaksha. Va:yu was very enthusiastic. He felt, ‘Indra should have sent me first, instead of insignificant Agni.’ He arrogantly went to the yaksha. \n[Va:yu] Who are you? \n[Yaksha] I will tell you, but first tell me who you are. \n[Va:yu] va:yurva aham asmi:thya bravi:th ma:tharishva va aham asmi:thi (You don’t know who I am? I make the air move everywhere. Without me, no one can live.) \n[Yaksha] What can you do? What is your strength? \n[Va:yu] I can blow away whatever comes in my way. \n[Yaksha] Oh really? I don’t know about that, but can you move this blade of grass? \nVa:yu used all his might but couldn’t even move that single blade of grass. He felt embarrassed and hid his face in shame. \nsathatha e:va nivavruthe: (he retreated) Indra is the leader of de:vatha:s. Everyone had been sent, but in vain. Hence, Indra himself went to the yaksha to find out about him. He felt, ‘Why all of them? I myself will go find out.’ As he was the leader of celestial beings, Lord Vishnu didn’t want to insult him in front of everyone. So the yaksha stopped being visible and used only speech to communicate with Indra. \n‘Victory is not a result of all your effort. The reason for victory is something else.’ Thus, Lord Vishnu made them realize that fact. When you assume you are capable of something and realize you are not, the resulting feeling is nirveda. Only when you feel nirveda, you will think, ‘Who am I? Because of whom did I win? Because of whom did I get this opportunity? Who is that?’ A desire to know all these arises in one’s heart. \nUntil one feels nirveda, whatever is said will simply enter one ear and exit through the other. A bodybuilder who thinks there is no one as strong as he, if he gets hospitalized with corona and is on a ventilator, then he will understand the importance of oxygen, doctor, good medicine, etc. Until that time, he doesn’t realize it. Until that time, he will be boasting about himself wherever he goes. Then, he feels nirveda and thinks, ‘Though I am so strong, even I became like this. Even I became so helpless.’ \nWhen he experiences nirveda, he feels the curiosity to approach and take guidance from someone. Sri Krishna is clarifying this in verse 2.53. \nsruthi viprathipanna: the: yada: stthasyathi nischala: | sama:dha: vachala: buddhihithada: yo:gam ava:psyasi || (When you listen carefully, your mind becomes steady and focused, and then you will attain yoga.) \nLord has said this earlier, \nvyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi e:ka bahu sa:kha:hi anantha:scha buddhaya avyavasa:yina:m (Whoever has decisive single-focused knowledge will get good results. For the ones who don't have it, their intelligence is multi-directional. They will not achieve anything.) He called them avyavasa:yis (indecisive) prior to this. \nVyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi is also called yoga. The sa:dhana (dedicated practice) is also called yoga. When he practices this way, it will result in a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization). He rises beyond the body and attains himself. Or he can attain the Lord. \nIn the first 6 chapters of Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna doesn’t mention attaining God. In the first 6 chapters, it is said that to attain the ultimate goal, first realize a:thma (self). First find out who you are. Initially, that much is enough. Once you properly know yourself and realize someone is directing you… Who is the one who is doing that? What does it mean to ‘direct’ you? How to understand that? If you know it, what should you do? All these questions arise. \nThat will come later. He will start explaining that from chapter 7. However, in the first 6 chapters of the scripture, there is no mention of God, Supreme Soul, realization. Only self (soul) realization is mentioned. Hence, let’s limit ourselves to that [for now]. That is known as ‘yoga’ here. However, the term yoga is used in many contexts. \nIn Sanskrit, certain words have many meanings. Only if we know which word to use in a particular context, will we gain a proper understanding of it. Otherwise, we get lost. We will just be carried away in that current. Yoga is also one such amazing word. Yoga has yo:gaha (union), sannahana (connection), upa:ya (means), dhya:na (meditation), sangathi (association), yukthishu (reasoning)… We can use the term yoga in all these contexts. \nSri Krishna used yoga in different contexts to mean different things. He is saying, thada yo:gam ava:psyasi (then you will attain yoga), here in verse 2.53. The yoga here means the stage where you can have a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization). Who should attain a:thma? A:thma itself. How can a:thma attain itself? It’s like seeing yourself. How would that be? It means to fully realize a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul) in complete clarity. \nWhat do you mean by obtaining a:thma jna:na? Ji:va (soul), or a:thma, is somewhere inside [the body]. However, over it, there is a shield. A:thma is always safe in the body. We need to realize this. A:thma is inside in the form of jna:na (knowledge). This is the first level. It is encapsulated by a layer called manas (mind). This jna:na has to transform into wisdom. \nThe resulting nischalatha (steadfastness) from listening should occur in intellect. On top of manas, there are instruments called indriya:s (senses). These senses work through the visible body. This is what it means by knowing ourselves. We are safe in this external armor called the body. We should know this. \nWe say that we do activities stimulated by the recorded karmas (actions), yet we can’t see where they are located. In general, we can’t see manas, indriya:s, a:thma, etc., through any modern scientific instrument. However, scriptures say that the past karmas, responsible for our coming into this body, are stored in different places. Sri Krishna discusses this also as we proceed a little further. \nHowever, as we need to know it now and can’t yet step that far ahead, let's discuss it now itself. \nindriya:ni manaha buddhihi athya adhishta:na muchyathe (The senses, mind, and intellect are places where karma is stored.) Indriya:s (senses) are one of the places where karma is stored. Manas (mind) is one store, buddhi (intellect) is another. This whole body is a store. Karma gets stored in all these places. \nAs the impact of karma increases, jna:na (knowledge) of the a:thma gets buried behind karmas. It becomes difficult for a:thma to recognize itself. It’s like sending a young boy to the market to get something. Once he comes out, suppose he meets a few of his favorite friends. He starts talking to them, playing with them, and forgets the purpose for which he came. \nOnce we come into the body, we get lost in indriya:s, manas, body, and the surrounding environment. We forget the purpose we came for and get involved in other things. That’s the actual problem. What happens because of that? Whatever new activity we do creates new records and increases the burden [of karmas] in them [manas, indriyas, buddhi, a:thma]. \nThis is like soot getting accumulated on a glass chimney around a lamp. As the lamp keeps burning, more and more soot gets accumulated on the chimney. Similarly, the indriya:s which are already loaded with karmas accumulate more karmas. Manas and buddhi also accumulate more karmas. Just as more dirty water accumulates in quicksand, all these karmas get added to the body. Right now, we are in that situation. \nWhat do we desire? We want clean water to enter the ‘body’ and to gradually eliminate the waste. What should we do for that? First, we should listen to the Wise. Sri Krishna is clarifying that in verse 2.53. \nsruthi viprathipanna: the: yada: stthasyathi nischala: | sama:dha: vachala: buddhihi thada: yo:gam ava:psyasi || (When you listen carefully, your mind becomes steady and focused, and then you will attain yoga.) \nOnly then, you can know with clarity who you are. Here, the term yoga means knowing yourself clearly - i.e., a:thma avalo:kana (self-observation) or a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization). What do you need to do before this? Sruthi (listening), listen. You have to listen. \nWith listening, we must undergo proper transformation. How should we listen? What kind of transformation is needed? What should we know about a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra? Let’s proceed further, learning about these. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita chapter 2 teaches how we can utilize our lifestyle for a good benefit. In fact, it is established that the second chapter is the summum bonum (highest good) of the entire Bhagavad Gita. If we understand the second chapter well, it means we have understood the entire Bhagavad Gita. Whatever has to be explained is described in a concise manner in the second chapter. To understand the underlying details, we need to go through the other chapters.\nWhat is the essence of Bhagavad Gita? Do your duty. Do your duty, but don’t focus on desiring (wanting) temporary benefits. It doesn’t mean that you won’t get benefits, or you should leave the benefits, or that you shouldn’t expect results. You should have a goal. Before you reach the goal, whatever intermediary benefits you might get, …stop pining for them. If you desire them, you can’t reach the main goal. We need to understand this.\nHow is it possible to work without expecting anything? You may have such a doubt. Normally you won’t feel like working without any benefit. If you shouldn’t desire anything, then, how can we work? You can have desires. However, don’t desire small, temporary benefits. Desire the big goal. Don’t lose the opportunity of attaining the main goal by desiring small, temporary benefits. This needs to be explained. The Lord declares this in Bhagavad Gita verse 2.51.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarmajam phalam thyakthva padam gachchanthi ana:mayam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nRenouncing the results of actions, they go to the place free from sorrow.\n-----------------------------------------------\nTo understand this clearly, we need to carefully listen. What happens by listening? The more you listen and understand… the more your prior developed interest towards temporary benefits and happiness subsides. That is called moha (ignorance). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmo:ham vyathi tharishyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou can escape this ignorance.\n-----------------------------------------------\nOnly then, we will feel nirveda (regret) for not yet attaining what we should have attained. We feel nirveda when we think, ‘For so long, we did not attain what we had to attain…’ ‘though we had an opportunity, we have lost it.’ This is a sort of sorrowful remorse. Sri Krishna described that we will feel regret this way in verse 2.52.\nOnly when we feel nirveda, moha will reduce. To feel nirveda, you should listen.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsro:thavyasya shruthasya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBecause of the faith we have in whatever we have heard so far,\n-----------------------------------------------\nand the interest we have in what we will hear in the future, we feel nirveda. What do we do when we feel nirveda? As discussed in verse 2.51, we can then renounce results. When we can renounce results…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nana:mayam padham gachchanthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthen we can attain permanent benefit.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn general, common people’s interest towards petty objects is called ishta (liking). If ishta strengthens, we call it prema (love). If prema grows tremendously, we call it moha. If you have love towards something, it makes you always ruminate (think deeply). If love grows and becomes moha, then you will not remember anything else except that which you love. It will not let you pay attention to other things.\nIf we have to focus a camera lens on an object clearly, we keep rotating the angle of the lens, then that specific object will appear with clarity and all other surrounding objects will fade out. There is a mechanism for that. Similarly, you have to focus on what you love. When it blossoms into moha, you will automatically only focus on that, nothing else. If this increases further, it is known as vimoham (intense love) or vyamo:ham (consistent love). If one has this, one only sees that object or person, …with eyes closed or open and everywhere around him. In any situation, he can only see what he is thinking about.\nIt seems Ramanuja Acharya used to have that vyamo:ham. We have heard of Ramanuja Acharya. He was the great personality who gave a proper meaning to Bhagavad Gita …and clarified Sri Krishna’s intent by composing ‘Gita Bhashyam.’ We are learning from that now. He had great vyamo:ham it seems. Oh, but he is a sannyasi (renunciant), right? Yes! If he is a renunciant, he should be free of mohas, right? Yes! Then if he should be free of mohas, why are you saying he has vyamo:ham? He has it! He has great vyamo:ham!\nWhat is that vyamo:ham? Our purvacharyas (previous teachers) explained. This vyamo:ham is not something which sways. It is consistent, always there.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyo: nithyam achyutha pada:mbuja yugmarukma vyamo:hatha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe who is always absorbed in the pair of lotus feet of Achyutha (the Lord).\n-----------------------------------------------\nGenerally, gold is the prominent commodity which invokes moha (excessive love) in us. Thus, even big countries try to increase their stock of gold. It is said whichever country has more gold, their economic strength will be great. Gold is an amazing metal which is loved by everyone. Not only recently, but for ages. Gold has been loved by everyone for a long time, it still is …and perhaps will always be loved in the future. Because it is one of the excellent glowing metals accessible to us. Based on its radiance and value, that kind of vyamo:ham will be there. Ramanuja also used to have vyamo:ham towards gold. \nCan a sannyasi have such vyamo:ham? Yes! But what kind of gold is that?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nachyutha pada:mbuja yugma rukma vya:mo:hathaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe gold of the lotus feet of Achyutha (the Lord).\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat do you mean by two golds? Does it mean fake gold and real gold? No, both of them are real gold. What kind of yugma (pair)? It is a yugma, a pair of beautiful lotus flowers. Padma yugma - pair of lotus flowers. What kind of lotuses? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npa:da padma\nSLOKA MEANING -\nlotuses of a pair of feet.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhose pair of feet? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nachyutha pada:mbuja yugma rukma vya:mo:hathaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe one who protects all of us, that Achyutha’s, Narayana’s, feet.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey are called charanau (the pair of feet). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsimanna:ra:ya:na charanau saranam prapadhye\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThose feet are like amazing lotus flowers which have affection towards us.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey are naturally fragrant and are pleasing to touch. They don’t leave those who surrender to them. ‘Thin kagal’ says our alwar (great saint). Even if we wish to leave them, they don’t leave us. That pair of feet is the gold. The vyamo:ham which Ramanuja has for that gold can’t be expressed. As that vyamo:ham grew, he ceased seeing everything else around him.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthadhithara:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\neverything else except those feet.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthruna:ya me:ne:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nhe renounced the rest, as one would a blade of grass.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is what Sri Krishna says. What do we need to increase? If we grow our vyamo:ham on the ‘gold’ called Lord’s feet, its value will always increase, and it will also increase the value of others by its touch. However, the other material gold which we know will melt someday, or someone might steal it from us. It will cause us loss. We heard of a story in Srimad Bhagavatam. The great Satrajith used to have a magnificent jewel which manifested gold for him. We read that story on Vinayaka Chavithi day. Satrajith went through great effort, obtained the grace of Lord through the Sun, and was bestowed with that jewel. He attained immense wealth. What ultimately happened? That jewel took his life. \nBecause of his vyamo:ham towards the jewel, even when Sri Krishna was accessible,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthruna:ya me:ne:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nhe renounced Lord as one would a blade of grass.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAt least, did the jewel protect him? No, it didn’t. It took his life. Someone killed him in his sleep and took the jewel. So, gold (other than Lord’s feet) is like that gold. However, achyutha pada:mbuja, that gold which is Narayana’s feet, is great. It doesn’t diminish. It won’t let the one who surrendered to be destroyed. It increases the respect and value of those who surrendered. If you want to desire, then desire for something like that. If one desires that, he becomes -\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\njanma bandha vinirmukhthaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthe reason for his body, karmic bondage, will be broken.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nanamayam padham gachchanthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nhe will reach that place of gold which never gets destroyed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is what the Lord said and this is what we have to listen to. Who will go there? Arjuna, whoever you think of as relatives, grandfathers, uncles, etc. are dehas (bodies). Bodies don’t go there. Bodies will certainly be destroyed here. Who will go there? Atma (soul) will reach there. The body will be destroyed. Atma won’t be destroyed. You should know this. The tatva (reality), which we should know isn’t visible. It can be heard. Hence, we should listen.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsro:thavyaha manthavya:ha nidhi dhya:sithvyaha yatha drashtavya:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou should see that which is permanent.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHowever, for it to be seen, what do you need to do? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsro:thavyaha manthavya:ha nidhi dhya:sithvyaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFirst, you have to listen.\n-----------------------------------------------\nFor us, listening is a big problem. We feel we don’t understand it, so we can’t listen to it. Firstly, we have a problem with listening. As soon as you start listening, you won’t understand everything. Yet, you have to listen. After listening for some time, you will feel… ‘this is a term we heard before.’ ‘I can relate to this’. It is a gradual growth. As listening is so important, you must start listening! The more you listen, the more the attachment you have towards other things will decrease.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyadha:the mo:ha kalilam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nwhatever is causing you ignorance, that dirt.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvyathi tharishyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nyour intellect can cross over it.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthadha gantha:si nirve:dam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nonly with listening [to the wise], will you get regret.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is important is that only with nirveda, you will know what needs to be known, attain atma sakshatkara (realization of the soul). You have to listen. Sri Krishna is now going to teach us about listening. Let’s understand what he teaches further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), If a person wants to excel in any field, he should listen to topics related to that field. He should have faith in what he hears. Whatever he has faith in, he has to establish it firmly in his heart. That is called mananam (contemplation), the process of firmly establishing in the mind what we hear by reasoning using related and familiar aspects. It is said that, ‘you have to do mananam properly’. Whoever does mananam is called muni (sage).\nWhat does it mean by doing mananam? It means applying different familiar aspects from the past so that whatever we hear can be established in our hearts. This makes us feel, ‘This is very good. This is what I need for sure’. Engraving it in our mind with different logical points, that is called mananam.\nWhat is the result of performing mananam? Whatever you perform mananam on, you will be ‘seeing’ it. If a person is reflecting on a movie he likes - wherever he is, he can only see the movie. Let’s say he is reflecting on a person. Wherever he is, he can only see and hear that person. Even if the wind blows, we hear that person. With any sound, we visualize that person. Whatever is firm in our heart, we feel as if we are ‘seeing’ it. We may not actually see it, but it feels as though we are ‘seeing’ it. This is called dhya:nam (meditation), nidhi dhya:nam (deep meditation). Thinking about something uninterruptedly.\nWhen you think that way, it feels as if that object is right in front of you. Let’s say your son has gone to a foreign country. If you think about him constantly - you feel as if that boy is calling you and you can hear his voice from somewhere. It feels as if the boy is saying, ‘mother’. It feels like that. If it gets more intense, you feel as if you are 'seeing' him.\nThis [feeling] is given a name. The boy is far away. His presence is paro:ksha (indirectly perceivable) as he is not prathyaksham (directly perceivable). We have the knowledge that he is paro:ksha. Hence, we started thinking about him more. What happens then? It changes into aparo:ksha sa:ksha:thka:ra (direct perception). It is not called prathyaksha sa:ksha:thka:ra as the object does not exist in front of us. It is called aparo:ksha sa:ksha:thka:ra because it feels as if the object is right in front of us.\nLet’s say someone likes mangoes - he feels, ‘they are so good and big. They are so soft.’ ‘They are so tasty when you drink the juice.’ Even while sleeping, he dreams of them. Sometimes he wakes up from the dream, feeling that he has the fruit and is eating it. If someone comes to awaken him, he asks what happened to the fruit. He will cry as if someone has taken the fruit away. Nothing happened. Yet, what he sees internally is so clear as if it [fruit] is right in front of him. It is called aparo:ksha - as it is not paro:ksha, indirect nor prathyaksha, direct. Hence it is aparo:ksha, intuitive. Are we not able to ‘see’ it? We can ‘see’ it. Can we not ‘feel’ it? We can ’feel’ it. Hence, it is called aparo:ksha sa:ksha:thka:ram (knowledge obtained intuitively).\nThey called it with another technical term. It is as good as seeing. darsana sama:na a:kruthi (form equivalent to vision) It is not darsana (visible to the naked eye), but equivalent to it. Hence it is called darsana sama:na a:kruthi. We should attain this first, when we are here. Regarding what? Regarding a:thma (soul). Why should we have it? You feel that killing others in war is bad, and thus you will go to hell. It is not your business to think about hell or that others get hurt or even die when hit with your arrows. You should follow through with your responsibility. Why should you think what might happen if you do it?\nHH's words: Why do you have to think about those kinds of things? What does a surgeon do when he has to operate? He just operates. ‘What should I do if the patient expires? His people might get hurt and accuse me.’ That’s none of his business. As a doctor, with his qualification, knowledge, and capability, he should do the best he can. It is his duty to do it. Depending on other circumstances, the patient may or may not survive. If he survives, the doctor doesn’t have to feel proud that it is because of him. If he expires, he doesn't have to feel guilty and cry. Doctors are great. We can say they have good jna:na (knowledge). Nowadays we are seeing a lot of doctors like that.\nRelatives take the patient to the hospital, pay fees, and go through tremendous efforts. A surgeon operates. If the patient expires, the body is packed and handed over. If he survives, he is united with the relatives. ** Note to Anil: Check with AB Swami if this needs to be cut to not turn into controversial. | The surgeon is not affected by it in any way except doing what he has to do, right? This is in a material sense. Arjuna should also think in a similar way. Responsibility! What is a military personnel’s responsibility when at the border? He has to protect the border and he has to restrain anyone who crosses it. While restraining someone, he shoots them if needed. If he hesitates to do so, the opposing person will shoot. Hence, pondering over the result… ‘Will I win or lose? Will I go to heaven or hell?’\nHH’s words: All these things are none of your business. HH’s words: Your duty is to do your responsibility. Waging war is your responsibility, hence do it. What will you get if you do so? If you wage war, you will attain mo:ksha (release from the cycle of births and deaths), the same as what one gets by doing penance in a forest. As you are doing your duty here, you will get mo:ksha. One who doesn't have this opportunity, by going to the forest, doing penance, may or may not get mo:ksha. As long as you are doing your duty, there is no question that you do not attain it.\npadam gachchanthi anamayam (you will go to a state free from suffering) Actually, you got the body for that [purpose]. If you don’t want to make the body work for the purpose it is given, then you are not fulfilling your dharma (duty). If someone neglects his dharma, how can he get utthama gathi (a better state)? This is what needs to be listened to. Hence, Arjuna needs clarity on a:thma thaththva (the truth of the soul). Not just for Arjuna, it has to be clarified for all of us as well. We need to be determined about fulfilling our duties properly.\nFor that to happen, while doing our duty, we shouldn’t be overly disturbed about temporary gains or losses. Arjuna is getting disturbed like that. Hence the Lord has to preach to him so much! More than these temporary benefits, there is a great permanent benefit called a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (direct realization of the soul). Lord says you will get this. padam gachchanthi anamayam (you will go to the Lord’s abode) What do you need to do for that? You have to hear about its greatness. What should I listen to? About a:thma. Listen to that which doesn’t get destroyed. Even if you pay a lot of attention to the ones getting destroyed, they will be destroyed anyway. Listen to what doesn’t get destroyed. What doesn’t get destroyed? A:thma. Where does it reside? Here [in the body]. Who has it? Everyone has it. If you fulfill your duty, it [a:thma] will be released from bondage.\njanma bandha vinirmukhthaha (properly and completely released from karmic bondage) We need to know this. How will A:thma be? We know about the body. It has a face, hands, legs, head, teeth, ears, eyes, skin, etc. What is a:thma like? It is in the form of jna:na (knowledge). It has jna:na as its guna (characteristic). So, is it all knowledge? Yes! Then you can simply call him knowledge, instead of saying he has a form of knowledge or characteristic of knowledge.\nSa:sthra (scripture) says a:thma’s swaru:pa (form) is very subtle. e:sha:ha anuhu a:thma (this is the subtle soul) Scriptures prove that he is anu (minute), which means he is very subtle. How can such a subtle one do anything? It has knowledge as a characteristic just as jaggery (sugar) has sweetness. Similarly, a lamp has light. What kind is that [characteristic]? That is knowledge. What about it [a:thma]? It is also knowledge. How is that possible? He is also knowledge and he also has knowledge? Aren’t we seeing it [in the world]? Jaggery is sweet and what jaggery has is also sweet. A salt crystal is salty and what it has is also salty. However, there is a difference in both.\nWe discussed earlier that worldly examples are not sufficient to describe a:thma. Because the components of a:thma and worldly objects are different. Matter and a:thma are completely different entities. Material objects get destroyed. We are taking examples from this. We are trying to prove an indestructible a:thma through destructible objects. How is it possible? It will help in knowing a little about it. How does it help? A lamp glows as a concentrated flame like a bindu (point of source). From this [source point], light spreads. We call what is glowing in the center the:jas (fire). What is radiating from it is also called the:jas. Both are the:jas particles. What is the difference? The first the:jas is stationary and the second the:jas spreads around. There is another difference between them. In the the:jas that spreads around, there is movement. In the first the:jas, fire, there is stability. One has stability, the other has movement. We should know this.\nThese [both] are defined with certain names. If the first the:jas exists, the:jas also exists in the spreading around portion. If this doesn’t exist, the one that spreads around also will not exist. That much is clear, right? If the bindu [source point] exists, the the:jas that spreads from it will exist. Otherwise, it won’t exist. Hence, the first one is called gu:ni (the one with qualities) which has guna (characteristic). The one which is spreading is called guna. To put it another way, this [source point of light] has the dharma (characteristic) of spreading and giving light, hence it is called dharmi ka:nthi (light that has qualities). What is spreading is also ka:nthi (light). What is the difference between both? The existence of the one that spreads around is dependent on the existence of this [bindu], hence it is ka:nthi. That is dharma.\nOne is ka:nthi that is dharmi, the other is ka:nthi that is dharma. Dharma ka:nthi is dependent on the other one, hence it is called dharma. In technical terms, bhu:tha (existence) is the term to use when one thing exists as something. Ka:nthi exists as dharmi, it is called dharmi bhu:tha ka:nthi. It [ka:nthi that exists as dharma] is called dharma bhu:tha ka:nthi. Dharmi doesn’t depend on dharma but dharma depends on dharmi. If there is a fruit, taste is perceivable. But, fruit doesn’t depend on taste. Dharma depends on dharmi. This is an example of a lamp. A:thma is also like that.\nWe have to recognize the same in a:thma with reference to knowledge. How? Let’s learn about that tomorrow. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 110,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We are discussing verses 2.51, 2.52, and 2.53 in the second chapter of Bhagavad Gita. The Lord emphasizes the importance of attaining the permanent good benefit and advises us to keep aside inferior, trivial benefits. Only then can we reach that good goal, as stated by the Lord.\nWhat is that good goal? Arjuna needs to be informed about it. He must understand that attaining this goal is guaranteed. Only then can he focus his attention on it. Otherwise, he risks losing both trivial and permanent benefits, leading to fear and confusion.\nPreviously, the Lord explained to Arjuna what the trivial benefits are. Not waging war, simply eating, and enjoying are all trivial benefits that provide only temporary happiness. The permanent benefit is attaining the eternal, indestructible, ever-radiating atma (soul), even if it means losing trivial benefits. Shedding the flaws that cover the brilliance of the atma and allowing it to shine brilliantly is the true permanent benefit.\nTo achieve this, Arjuna must first focus on it and gain knowledge about it. What should he know about the atma? We all recognize that jnana (knowledge) is significant. The atma is that which possesses the jnana; this is referred to as jnanaika akaram (form of knowledge itself).\nIf we look for an example in the world, we can consider a sugar crystal. A sugar crystal is sweet and has only sweetness. It is sweetness all over, nothing else. Similarly, salt crystals are entirely salty. One who embodies only knowledge is called jnana swarupa (form of knowledge) or jnanaika akara. This is the atma.\nNot only is the atma knowledge, but it also imparts knowledge. If it imparts knowledge, won't it diminish? This is why we hesitate to use sugar crystals or jaggery as examples. If we lick a sugar crystal, it reduces in size and eventually gets consumed, just like salt crystals.\nHowever, the atma is not like that. It is like the Surya (Sun). The Sun gives us heat and light. For how long has it been giving? According to our elders, it has been providing light for 400 or 800 crores of years. It will continue to emit light for that many more years. We are currently in the middle of that timeframe.\nSome may argue, \"You say a salt crystal reduces by licking; the Sun is also like that.\" The Sun currently provides light 24 hours a day and 365.4 days a year. That is true! However, how long will it continue to provide light? After it has emitted light for as many years as its limit, it will lose its power and become a planet without radiance. Therefore, we cannot consider the Sun as a perfect example.\nWhile the Sun is a better example than a salt crystal, sugar crystal, or a lamp, it is still not ideal. A lamp only glows if we provide fuel for it; if the fuel depletes, the lamp stops glowing. However, the Sun does not melt or require fuel to shine. \nOne example may be better than another, but even the Sun is not a perfect representation. One day, due to some merit (sukrutha), it attained light, and once that merit is consumed, it will inevitably lose that light. However, the akruthi (form) of the atma's jnana does not diminish like a sugar crystal when licked. It does not require fuel like a lamp. Unlike the Sun, which loses radiance after 800 or 1600 crores of years, the atma will not lose knowledge over time. The atma's knowledge is eternal; it remains unchanged across all three time periods.\nThat is the atma. That is 'You.' Do not think the atma is somewhere else. No! The atma is us. We are all like that. In fact, all prani (living beings) are like that. The atma is covered by the body. Hence, although the atma is very bright, its natural state becomes masked. However, it operates through the body, functioning to the extent of the body's strength.\nWhat is the mechanism for it to express its knowledge outward? There is an immediate layer of manas (mind) outside of it. On top of that, there is a layer of indriyas (senses). Above that is the physical body layer. Knowledge must pass through these layers.\nThis body has seven layers, and each layer is very strong. Let me give you an example to help you visualize how each layer functions. What happens if boiling water spills on the body? You get blisters. The blister forms from the outermost skin layer that absorbs the water and steam, storing it inside. \nOut of those seven layers, one layer rises slightly. It is a very thin layer, but it remains strong. Despite the heavy fluid inside, it is so strong that unless you poke a hole in it, there is no chance for the fluid to escape. It keeps the fluid contained as long as the blister remains intact. Almost everyone has experienced small boils after being burned or when hot water, coffee, tea, milk, or soup spills on the skin. Even if you haven't experienced it, you may have seen others who have.\nThat one layer is strong. There are seven such layers. Beneath them are the fat and muscle of the body. Further underneath are the indriyas (senses), and deeper still is the manas (mind). We have so much protection above it. \nUnder these protective layers, the jiva (soul) dwells with knowledge. This knowledge must be expressed through all these layers. In whatever ways the manas, senses, and body cooperate, the knowledge is sent outward accordingly. \nActually, the jiva is great. However, it must control whatever it is as long as it resides there. If we pour water into a colored glass, the water appears colored. For example, if a long glass is painted with an opaque color in the center and left uncolored on the top and bottom, the water will be visible at the top and bottom but not in the center. \nThe body is similar. Based on the body type, knowledge also reflects accordingly. It must pass through the manas, indriyas, and body. If there is an opaque color anywhere in between, then knowledge will not reflect through it. Primarily, the manas is like a heavily colored glass, with the atma inside it.\nThe karma vasana bijas (residual imprints of our actions) cling to the manas. They also attach to the indriyas and the body. Knowledge must pass through these layers. It goes in and out through them. Earlier, we discussed our ruchi (interest), moha (desire), and vyamoha (deep adoration) for temporary benefits, which impact our karma.\nThe imprints of our karmas are stored in the layers of the manas, indriyas, and body. One's knowledge is pure. However, because knowledge emerges from those layers, it operates in alignment with them, causing the body to function accordingly. Regardless of the nature of the jiva, as long as it resides within, it has no choice but to cooperate.\nThus, it operates this way. Therefore, Sri Krishna stated in verse 2.52:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyada: the: mo:hakalilam\nbuddhir vyathi tharishyathi |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen the intellect is overwhelmed by the quagmire of karmic imprints, it becomes confused.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis entire effect is called moha kalilam (quagmire of karmic imprints). The knowledge is passing through it, but it does not emerge clearly. It reflects as 'colored' (influenced by the karmic imprints). \nHence, we become trapped here. We mistakenly believe that the 'colors' are meant to be there. Thus, you entered this 'glass.' You will come out of this glass. You must. The Lord desires that for us. If you say, \"It is nice here; I will stay here permanently,\" that is incorrect.\nWhat must pass through these layers is knowledge. This knowledge is sent out by the soul residing within. Simultaneously, it constantly absorbs knowledge as well. When knowledge is expressed, all these layers function, performing good or bad deeds. Based on that, they add a new layer of samskaras (impressions). The jiva is inside; it does not possess any of these. Yet, these impressions attach to its jnana (knowledge). The jiva does not get attached to them, but they affect its knowledge.\nPreviously, we discussed that the jiva is a substance of tejas (radiance), and jnana is also a substance of tejas. One has dharma (of knowledge), while the other travels back and forth as dharma (of knowledge). Both are jnana. To understand the difference, the wise defined them with two names.\nThe atma that travels (due to karma) higher and lower and dwells in a body—referring to itself as 'I'—is called dharmi bhuta jnana (knowledge of the one who possesses dharma). Dharmi bhuta jnana means that which is knowledge. \nThen what is the one that is transmitted? It is named dharma bhuta jnana (knowledge of the one that is transmitted). All changes occur only to dharma bhuta jnana. The atma does not undergo any changes. However, it mistakenly believes that all changes are its own. That is the problem.\nChanges happen in dharma bhuta jnana, but dharmi bhuta jnana thinks those changes are its own. If it does not concern itself with those changes, it will act according to the purpose for which it came, as defined by scriptures and the wise, even if the manas, indriyas, and body do not agree.\nIf the soul compels the indriyas, body, and manas to act, then the 'colors' on them will clear. It will not add new 'colors.' Waging war is your duty. Set aside whether you like it or not or what you will gain from it. Doing it is your duty, so just do it.\nWhat happens then?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmo:hakalilam vyathi tharishyathi thava buddhihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYour intellect will clear the colors accumulated on the glass.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe glass will become clear. Total transparency will be there. For this to happen, one must have the determination to do so. They should also realize that they are pure and unattached. This realization comes through listening.\nHence, listening is at the root of everything. First, listen. Next, firmly establish it in your manas (mind) as if it is right in front of you. If these two things happen, then you have attained yoga (union). \nSri Krishna used the term yoga in chapter 2. He said in verse 2.39, \"I will first tell you yoga.\" He continued in verse 2.48, \"Yoga should be part of your karma.\" He stated in verse 2.48, \"yogaha samatvam\" (yoga is equanimity). He said in verse 2.50, \"yogaha karmasu kausalam\" (yoga is skill in action). \nHowever, in verse 2.53, He said, \"thatha yogam avapsyasi\" (then you will attain yoga). Engage in yoga, use it as a means, and you will attain yoga. How is it? That's the irony. That’s the beauty of the word yoga. Let’s gradually proceed forward and understand what that means.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

At the end of each chapter, there is a pushpika, the last set of words in a section. It states the name of the chapter, what the chapter describes, or the intended audience. The line that states all these is called churika, an unbroken harmonious line of prose. Such an informational statement is called pushpika. It is at the end of each chapter.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nithi srimad bhagavad gi:tha:su upanishathsu bramha vidya:yam yo:ga sa:sthre sri krushnarjuna samva:de\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThus, in the Bhagavad Gita, which is a scripture of yoga, in the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis scripture is named as yoga sastra (scripture of yoga). There is the yoga abhyasa (practice of yoga) that includes various types of pranayamas (breathing exercises) and exercises. All that is referred to as yoga. It is also called yoga. However, the one being expressed in Bhagavad Gita is not that type of yoga. Sri Krishna uses the term yoga in various ways and in different contexts. Especially in the second chapter itself, He used it in different ways. In the beginning itself, He said…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyo:gastha kuru karma:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBe in yoga and perform your duties.\n-----------------------------------------------\nPrior to that, He said, ‘I have told you about sankhya buddhi (knowledge of the soul), now listen about yoga buddhi (knowledge of action).‘\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:sha the: abhihitha sa:nkhye buddhi yo:ge thu ima:m shrunu\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is what has been explained as sankhya buddhi; now listen to the yoga buddhi.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe said, “I explained sankhya buddhi until now. Now, I will tell you about yoga buddhi, knowledge about action. Listen.” Later on, He says, samathvam yoga uchchyathe (equanimity is called yoga), yoga karma su kausalam (skill in action is called yoga). He said yoga in so many instances. What is this yoga? What is that yoga? What is the yoga He spoke of next and again later? We need to know that, right?\nOne of the meanings of yoga is karma (action), any activity we do. It is linking us with an activity. Hence, it is called yoga. The meaning of yoga is yuk (to link or to attach). As it joins us with a task, it is also called yoga. The second meaning of yoga is the underlying knowledge with which one performs an activity as a means to attain something. That knowledge is also called yoga, yoga sthah kuru karma:ni.\nIn another instance, samathvam yoga uchchyathe. Once you do a task, if you are not disturbed by the loss or benefits that result, that is also called yoga. It is called equanimity, the ability to accept it with balance. That samathva buddhi (equanimous intellect) is also called yoga. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarmasu yoga kausalam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nLord says it is very difficult to attain this equanimous intellect.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn verse 2.53, thada: yoga ava:psya:si, Lord says, ‘if you do this, you will attain yoga’. How can you attain yoga if you do yoga? If you do karma (work), you should get the result of the karma. How can you get karma if you do karma? Yoga doesn’t mean karma in this context. It is the final goal you attain. It is attaining atma sakshatkara (self-realization), not simply clarity on atma jnana (knowledge of the soul). This is also called yoga, the ultimate goal.\nLet’s discuss an example to understand it better. We see objects with our indriyas (senses). I am seeing a pillar in front of me with my eyes. A pillar is ‘something that is visible to the eye’. For that to be visible, there is some connection from me to the pillar. This connection also has a name. With the help of that connection, the object at a distance is seen by the eye. Just having an eye is not enough. The vision should be clear and it should go towards the pillar. We are talking about one indriya. We should correlate this understanding to other indriyas.\nIndriyas are called aksham (senses). The object accessible to indriyas is called prathi aksham (perceived object). The pillar is in front of the indriya. Hence, it is prathi aksham or prathyaksham (directly perceived). We all know this word. What is that which is named prathyaksham? Prathyaksham is the name of the pillar. Why is it called so? As the object is accessible to indriyas, it is called prathyaksham. Prathyaksham means a visible object. It is not limited to that only. The means to see the object is the eye, hence, it is also called prathyaksham.\nWhat do we call the eye? Prathyaksham. Not only the eye, but also the nose that smells, the ear that hears, the skin that can sense touch, the tongue which tastes - all these can be called as prathyakshams, i.e., indriyas. Ones perceivable by the indriyas are called prathyakshams. Indriyas are also called prathyakshams. There is some activity happening between the indriya and the object. That activity is also called prathyaksham. The instrument, means, and the object, all are called prathyakshams.\nSimilarly, for the term yoga as well. Yoga means karma. Yoga means the knowledge that must drive the karma. Yoga means the samathva nischaya (decisive equanimity), which results from that knowledge. Yoga means the activities which you do with this nischaya, where the final result, atma sakshatkara, is attained after forgoing temporary benefits. That is also called yoga. We hope this is clear and not confusing you.\nHH’s word - insist | In the second chapter, yoga is used in many contexts. Just so you don’t get flustered, we are insisting on it. Remember this. Know that atma sakshatkara is the highest benefit. Recognize that the work we are required to do now is the means for it. With the knowledge that it is your duty, do it. To know all this, one needs to listen. One needs to read it. Even if one doesn’t read it, if someone is explaining about it, one should listen to it from that someone, right? He should pay attention to whatever he listens to. Whatever he pays attention to, he should keep in his heart. He should introspect on whatever he keeps in the heart. After introspection, he should firmly establish it within the heart. All this happens from listening. Hence, listening is very important. It is the reason you feel nirvedam (repentance).\nIt [listening] is the reason nirveda is able to cleanse your knowledge. Applying the cleansed knowledge, if the tasks you do are pure, they become the means for moksha (release from birth and death). If you do a job that way, your job is a means for moksha. If you do farming, cooking, or studies - they become a means for moksha. \nHH’s words - the entire frame | If you do them with proper knowledge and proper awareness, any activity you do will become a means for moksha. Any movement you do with the body, inhaling and exhaling, opening and closing the eyes, stretching your hand front and back, sitting, standing, sleeping, eating, moving about, taking a shower - do any kind of activity, it becomes a means for moksha, only when you understand this tool (body) is given for that purpose.\nHowever, what causes the lack of this nischaya (decisiveness in knowledge)? What causes this lack of belief in us? The karma bijas (imprints of past actions), where are they located? Right, next to us. In our manas (mind). That’s where the problem is. Salya was sitting as a charioteer right in front of Karna and was saying sarcastically that Karna didn’t do a great job, can’t win, his strength is not that great, etc. What is it called?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsalya sa:ra:dhyam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nDeceiving and deceived.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHH’s words: deceiving and deceived. | Always deceiving through sarcastic words, never encouraging. How can Karna win if he is always discouraged? Even if one fails at times, if he is encouraged, ‘it is fine, next time do better’. Then he will be enthused and can do better. Even when performing well, if he is discouraged, he feels terrible and loses whatever energy he has. Isn’t it? \nFirstly, we need good encouragement and good listening. We need good and clear knowledge. We need to work on procuring this. Pay attention to your manas, which is not letting you have these. Manas is the one that discourages you and fills you with all unnecessary information. Be careful with your own manas. If your manas cooperates, you can do anything in the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmana e:va manushya:na:m ka:ranam bandha mo:kshayo:ho\nSLOKA MEANING -\nManas is the reason for a person to be degraded or reformed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nManas is the reason for a person to be degraded or reformed. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbandha:ya vishaya: sangi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe manas which fills you with unnecessary topics will only destroy you.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe manas which fills you with unnecessary topics will only destroy you.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmo:ksha:ya nirvishayam manaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf you don’t fill it with unnecessary topics, it will liberate you.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf you don’t fill it with unnecessary topics, it will liberate you. The irony is, if you don’t have dirty fuel in the engine, with the help of wind or waves, it [boat] might reach the shore one day. However, if polluted, then it [boat] keeps going in different directions and will try to drown you. So, whether you fill it with good thoughts or not, remove unnecessary information as the first step.\nOur people say, ‘eat healthy and necessary food if you can, otherwise don’t eat’. There is no loss with that. It is initially enough simply to not eat unnecessary junk. If you don’t eat that, you will be fine inside. It is fine if you don’t eat. You may feel weak for a few days. Your body will make use of what you already have. You can then begin eating healthy food; that’s better. \nSince manas is the primary instrument, if you can take out the unnecessary information about temporary benefits - if you can get rid of it - then what are you able to do?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkarmajam phalam thyakthva\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou are renouncing the results of your actions.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou are renouncing the results of your actions. Then you will get nirvedam and your manas will become clean. Then, srothavyasya shruthasya - You will be excited about what you have heard so far and what you will continue hearing in the future. You will have increased enthusiasm for listening. First, empty it [manas]. After that, you have to fill it with what needs to be filled. \nWhat needs to be filled are teachings about beneficial topics from wise people. What are those beneficial teachings about? Paramatma (Supreme Soul) and atma (soul), which give permanent benefit. Know about them. In the world, whatever you set as a goal, know about it. Focus on its characteristics, its benefits, etc. Pay attention to them; the rest will move aside [in your mind]. \nIf you want to pass the civil services exam, keep aside watching movies and playing games. Think about your goal constantly. Listen to its benefits. Then if not today, tomorrow you will succeed. This is what Sri Krishna is saying. We have to listen. Listening is a great art. We definitely have to learn this. In verse 2.53, Sri Krishna elaborates on the characteristics of listening. Let’s learn about them.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Once upon a time, there was a great person named Yajnavalkya. He was a great saint and a brahma jnani (knower of the ultimate truth), possessing knowledge of the Supreme. He had two wives, Kathyaayani and Maitreyi. Kathyaayani was very interested in material possessions and experiences, while Maitreyi was very capable and intelligent.\nAfter a few years, Yajnavalkya said, “I want to give away whatever I have earned so far to both of you. I will leave for the forests after that.” \nKathyaayani asked, “How much will you give?” \nYajnavalkya replied, “How much do you want?” \nKathyaayani insisted, “First, tell me how much you have.” \nYajnavalkya disclosed his wealth. \nKathyaayani demanded, “I want 50 percent of it.” Since there are three people, each normally gets 1/3rd. \nYajnavalkya asked again, “How much do you want?” \nKathyaayani reiterated, “I want my share.” \nThen he called Maitreyi. She didn’t demand any specific amount. \nYajnavalkya inquired, “Which part do you want?” \nMaitreyi responded, “I want what is valuable.” \nYajnavalkya explained, “Our property is very valuable. It yields three crops a year and is right next to the water. It gives us good profits and will sell for a high price. It’s valuable either way.” \nMaitreyi countered, “Yet, you are leaving this and going away. You would forgo this only if something else is more valuable than this. So, where are you going?” \nShe added, “Spouses usually don’t leave even if you go to Heaven. Maybe they will leave if you go to hell. Wherever you go, they come with you.” \nMaitreyi also asked, “Where are you going? You are going there as it is greater than this.” \nYajnavalkya affirmed, “Yes, that’s greater than this. These are worldly riches; I desire something eternal.” \nMaitreyi questioned, “What’s the difference?” \nYajnavalkya explained, “These are worldly objects, right? Sometimes you may reap a good crop, but when there are no rains or if there are pest infestations, you may not. If the ruler imposes heavier taxes, you may not reap the benefit. In such matters, you have profits and losses, and you have to work hard too. You face difficulties in this.” \nMaitreyi asked, “What about that [the more valuable thing]?” \nYajnavalkya replied, “If you can attain it, there is nothing in it that is destructible, and there will be no loss in that. It gives everlasting happiness.” \nMaitreyi responded, “You want to keep the one giving everlasting happiness and want to give us the one giving temporary benefits, which has profits and losses and which gets destroyed? I don’t want this.” \nYajnavalkya asked, “Then what do you want?” \nMaitreyi declared, “Whatever you are trying to attain, I want the same thing.” \nYajnavalkya inquired, “What will you do?” \nMaitreyi replied, “I will go with you wherever you go. Please grace me so I attain that too.” \nYajnavalkya asked, “What about the property?” \nMaitreyi said, “Do whatever you wish with it. Whatever you thought was not necessary, I don’t want it either.” \nKathyaayani was happy to hear that. She received the 1/3rd shares from each of them in addition to hers. She got the whole property and was satisfied with riches, keeping calm. Maitreyi left with Yajnavalkya. \nIn serving him (susru:sha), she implemented whatever upadesas (teachings) he gave her. History tells us this. One of the great upadesas which Yajnavalkya gave to Maitreyi was:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thma: va: are: drashtavyaha sro:thavyaha manthavyaha nidhi dhya:sithavyo: mai:thre:yi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHey Maitreyi, the atma (soul) is the only thing worth seeing, hearing, reflecting upon, and meditating on.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYajnavalkya is telling this to his beloved wife Maitreyi, emphasizing that everything other than atma (soul) should not be counted. Like everything else is ‘thruna:yame:ne’ (like blades of grass), for Ramanujacharya…\nYajnavalkya continues, “Only the atma is worthy of darsan (experience). How? First, sro:thavyaha (you must listen). You have to listen until you understand very clearly. What if we don’t understand the lesson which the teacher taught? We question and listen to it again. If we still don’t understand, we request for repetition and listen again. Don’t we repeatedly listen to something until we understand [in academics]? Similarly, sro:thavyaha, we have to listen until it is clear to us.”\nInitially, when you don’t know the meaning of it, you should still listen. When you start understanding it partly, you should continue to listen. \nGo:da Devi talks in Thiruppavai about birds. As soon as they wake up, they chirp. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npullum shilumbina\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAfter chirping for a while, when the sun rises, they go out to get their food individually as they can’t all go out together.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn the evening, they come together in order, but while going, they all go individually. One bird can go one way, another goes another way; they may or may not make it back, and it is not certain if they will meet each other again. They go out and don’t know what might happen later. They may not return back if a bigger bird, cat, or monkey catches them. Hence, before they go out separately, they speak out of happiness of being together, and they try to ‘pack’ these conversations into small parcels and carry them along.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nki:su ki:su enru engum anaichchatha:n kalandu pe:sina pe:chchi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe sounds of waking up and then the sounds of speaking to each other.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf they are speaking to each other, that means they are understanding [the sounds]. The sounds of waking up don’t have any meaning. They are arbitrary sounds like that of a sound when people stretch after waking up. There is no meaning to them. Meaningful words include ‘Are you ok? What are you doing? How are you?’ \nEven if they don’t make sense in the beginning, you have to listen to good words when the Wise instruct. Since they are meaningful words, even if they don’t specifically explain it to you, you have to listen. Listen to them as those are words that can explain ardham (meaning). \nAfter listening this way for some time, you will know how they can be of use to you and will be able to retain it in your heart. \nWhat should you do next? If what you have heard is for your wellbeing, you should do mananam (contemplation). \nWhat is mananam? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsruthasya ardhasya yukthibhihi manasi samstha:panam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWe should engrave in the heart what we heard by firmly establishing it using techniques and logic.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is called mananam. What happens if we do that? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thma: va:re drashtavyaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHow should we see it? \n-----------------------------------------------\nFirst, sro:thavyaha (listen) even when you don’t understand it, and also after you understand it. Later? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmanthavyaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nReflect properly on it repeatedly.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is said that as you keep eating something bitter, it begins to taste good. The more you practice a tune, the better it sounds. Even if something is bitter, if that taste gives us health, we will like it. \nMananam should progress uninterruptedly, similar to how honey trickles down in the form of an unbroken stream. Similarly, whatever nischaya jnana (firm knowledge) you had on that topic in the first moment should continue to the next moment, and the moment after that like a continuous stream. \nYou learned about what you need to attain, right? As the thought of that ‘desirable [tattva] being beneficial to us’ establishes in our heart, then the duration of dhyana (meditation) increases. \nHH’s words - concentration and density | The concentration on it and the density keeps increasing. \nWe will give you a better example. We want to light a lamp. What do we do then? We put a wick in it and pour oil or ghee into it. We ignite the end of the wick, and the wick keeps burning. \nWhat was necessary for this wick to burn? If a lot of oil is dropped on it at once, it will be put out. Also, if it doesn’t get the supply of oil, it will be put out. Or the wick might burn all the way through and be extinguished. \nThe oil reaches drop by drop through the wick and keeps the wick lit. If a water drop falls in between these drops, this water drop also traverses up with the oil drops. The flow starts with oil drops followed by a water drop and then the remaining oil drops. \nOil drops progress like a stream; the water drop also goes along. When the water drop reaches the end, the lamp will be put out. If you light it with the next oil drop, then it will light again. What happened? This [water drop] caused a break in that oil stream. With a single water drop, the lamp goes out. If there is another water drop, the flame again goes out. \nWhen we light a lamp, sometimes it makes a sputtering sound because of this phenomenon. This oil stream keeps the lamp burning continuously. Similarly, the thought of an object, word, or whatever we hear, reflected on, and felt as ours and benefitting… if that thought goes on in the same manner uninterruptedly, undisturbed by other thoughts… for approximately 33 minutes without a break, it is called dharana (focused concentration). \nIt should stay for that long. For us, it doesn’t even stay for 30 seconds, not even for 5 seconds. That thought will go and come back. If we constantly think of a custard apple, suddenly we may think of mango and come back to custard apple. \nLet’s say we are seeing Rama’s form in front of us constantly. We may see someone or something we like and then come back to Rama. Yet, it is considered broken. \nWhile using electronic devices, people use UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply). It is arranged so that there is no break even for half a minute. We should have that [continuous thought] in us. That is called yoga (union). If this continues in you, it is called one dharana. \nIf you can construct the flow of such dharana, when it fills your heart entirely, then you will attain yoga or atma sakshatkara (realization of the soul), says the Lord in sloka 2.53. \nLet’s see how that is by learning and understanding the verse. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 113,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We are learning the second chapter of Bhagavad Gita. It explains the great benefit a person with atma jnana (knowledge of the soul) attains. We are recollecting what Yajnavalkya told Maitreyi in this regard. He instructed Maitreyi in an Upanishad called Brihadaranyaka, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thma va:re: drushtavyaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthe essence of the soul can be clearly perceived\n-----------------------------------------------\nHow? \nsro:thavyaha (start with listening) - reflect on it incessantly, \nmanthavyaha - ensure that other thoughts don’t break or block this. \nHow should it be? \nyada: drashtavyaha thatha: nidhi dhya:sithavyaha (visualize it in your mind so clearly as if you were witnessing it with the naked eyes). It may be whatever you desire, worldly or eternal, object or a person. \nyada: drashtavyaha thatha: nidhi dhya:sithavyaha (Continue to practice visualizing it until it is as clear as if you can see it right in front of you). This is called darshana sama:na:ka:ra. It is called aparoksha sakshatkara (knowledge obtained intuitively). It means that it is not in front of you, but you ‘see’ it as if it were in front of you.\nSri Krishna explains the process of this in verse 2.53. Let’s read that verse.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsruthi viprathipanna: the:\nyada: stthasyathi nischala: |\nsama:dha: vachala: buddhihi\nthada: yo:gam ava:psyasi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen your mind is steady and undisturbed, then you will attain self-realization.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe term yoga here means atma darsana (self-realization). You will be able to attain atma darsana. Atma darsana means knowing about yourself. It is for you, not for someone else’s sake. You eat for your satisfaction and you shower to rejuvenate yourself. Similarly, knowing yourself is also something that gives you happiness. \nthada: yo:gam ava:psyasi (then you will attain clear realization of Self). Where and how will you attain it? \nsama:dha:u (in samadhi, this is a term we must remember) - Sama:dhi is a name for our manas (mind). Why did it get that name? In fact, sama:dhi is the name of the place where bodies are buried. The tomb that is constructed above the burial grave of the deceased is called sama:dhi. That meaning is also in use. However, the meaning [of sama:dhi] Sri Krishna uses here refers to our manas. This manas should become sama:dhi. \nThen, should we get equipment ready to bury it? HH’s words: You can’t do that | You can’t do that as you can’t get hold of it. Our people are wearing masks to protect themselves from the virus. However, the masks being used are of no use. Why? Because the virus is so small, even if you have a 3-layered mask, it has the power to penetrate through the mask. Also, people usually pull it up and down their noses. Once you touch it, it is contaminated. You especially shouldn't touch the top. \nWe see everyone wearing masks pulling them up and down. They don’t wash their hands after that. HH’s words - which is not right | and spread it [virus] all over, which is not right. The virus is so small, it can go through the four layerings of the mask… just as we can comfortably walk through a 10 ft wide entrance. \nAtma (soul) is much smaller than a virus. Know about it. Sri Krishna is explaining to Arjuna how to know the Self. Yajnavalkya instructed Maitreyi that she should know the minute Self, as if she were able to directly see it. You can’t see its form; you can know it with its qualities. You can’t see it with your eye; you can perceive it with your manas. \nvisuddha manasa: gra:hyaya (What it means to attain atma thattva, realization of self, is to perceive it if you have a manas). Indriyas (senses) can’t see it. Manas can ‘see’ it. Manas is called anthar indriya (internal sense). Still, manas can perceive it. When is that possible? When there is no ‘cataract’ in the manas. \nIf you have advanced cataracts, you can’t see objects. If you have medium cataracts, you will see two images of the same object. He might talk to his wife looking in one direction when in fact she may be in the opposite direction. That’s because he is seeing two images. That’s very dangerous, right? If there are no defects in the eye, you can see the object as is. Likewise, if there is no mo:ha kalilam (ignorance) in the manas, then we can see the desired atma thattva clearly. This is what the Lord said. \nThis is an internal perception. Hence, it is called aparoksha sakshatkara (knowledge obtained intuitively). Living in this world, despite being highly capable, or a great seeker or having performed many penances… if anyone says, ‘they saw the atma with their naked eyes’, they are making a fool of us. Because it is an invisible reality. It is perceivable to manas like a visible reality. \nOne can know it [atma] clearly only after leaving this body, getting released from karmic bondage, bathing in Viraja (the divine river), and crossing it… Until that point, you can only have darshana sama:na a:ka:ra sa:ksha:thka:ra (a realization equivalent to direct perception). It is aparoksha sakshatkara (experience by intuition). It is not pratyaksha (directly visible). We have to remember this. \nEven if you know that much, you have achieved a lot here. However, you won’t achieve it at once. There is a process for that. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsruthi viprathipanna…\nSLOKA MEANING -\nstart with listening\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat happens with listening? If you listen constantly, you will have viprathipanna (special knowledge). Prathipaththi is jnana (knowledge). One who has prathipaththi is prathipanna. Your buddhi (intellect) needs sruthi viprathipanna (knowledge from listening). Some people say viprathipanna is contradictory knowledge. That’s wrong. It means special knowledge. If you listen properly, you will learn new things. \nHence viprathipanna sruthi - you have to listen. To whom? Who is telling you? \n[Arjuna] It’s you. \n[Sri Krishna] Who do you think I am? \n[Arjuna] You are my brother-in-law. Right now, you are my charioteer. \nIs that all? However, Arjuna listened to Him with this feeling. Hence, after the second chapter, he said, “You are confusing my nischaya jnana (decisive knowledge). You are confusing me unnecessarily.” \nthath kim karmani go:re ma:m niyo:jayasi (Why do you ask me to do activities? You say jnana is great but ask me to work). Isn’t it better to go with jnana? This is how Arjuna questioned. If he had realized Sri Krishna is Wise and what he is saying is beneficial, would he have asked this? He wouldn’t have. \nAlmost till the end of the 10th chapter, Arjuna was with this feeling. He believed that the one who has come for him as a charioteer and is seated there is his brother-in-law. Arjuna felt, ‘He should drive the way I want him to, how can he advise me? If I listen to him, it will be like listening to an unqualified person.’ He had that feeling, that’s why he questioned him [Sri Krishna] in so many ways. \nAfter the Lord showed his virat rupa (universal form) in the eleventh chapter, Arjuna realized who He was. Then he understood the One sitting in front of him wasn’t just his brother-in-law or a charioteer sitting at his feet following his orders. He is sarva loka niyantha (controller of all worlds). He is all knowledgeable. Later, he came to know that. However, now the Lord has to tell him about Himself. \nsruthi viprathipanna (you get good knowledge by listening). Who are you listening to? I am all knowledgeable. I am all powerful. I control all the worlds. I am the reason for the universe consisting of moving and non-moving things. I am telling you. I know everything and control everything the way I wish, I am telling you. Hence you should listen. \nsruthi (listen), viprathipanna (not ordinary knowledge, you should get unique knowledge). What happens then? Prior to this, we have emptied our manas of unnecessary topics. It has become empty. All the mo:ha kalilam is gone. It has become like a vessel which has been cleaned. It has become a beautiful shining vessel. We should fill it. Whatever I am telling you, fill it with that. \nWhatever I am expounding as permanent and temporary, this atma jnana (knowledge of the soul), fill this [knowledge] in that. Fill it in what? The manas which has become empty. Don’t keep your mind empty. That’s very dangerous. Ghosts and spirits get into that. We know the saying, ‘Idle mind is a devil's workshop’. A lot of unnecessary thoughts will get into it. To stop that from happening, fill it with what I have told you. \nHow to fill it? This is what He is explaining. \nyatha stha:syathi (it has to get established in manas) in two ways. \nnischala (immovable), \nachala (steadfast). \nWhere? In sama:dhau (i.e., manas). We can discuss later how that came about. Stabilize it in the manas. What should you stabilize? The knowledge which you obtained by listening, the nischaya jnana (decisive knowledge) or buddhi, when you make it achala and nischala in your manas, then \nthada: yo:gam ava:psyasi (then you can perceive atma internally as clearly as if it were in front of you), you can attain a realization that is equivalent to direct perception. Whatever you are closely dedicated to while in the body, that is what you will attain after leaving this. You will definitely achieve that. \nIn verse 2.53, Sri Krishna clearly elaborated how to mold your manas. Let’s proceed further and attain more clarity. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Let’s explore how to build a strong mind. \nLet’s chant verse 2.53.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsruthi viprathipanna: the: yada: stthasyathi nischala: |\nsama:dha: vachala: buddhihi thada: yo:gam ava:psyasi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen your intellect is steady and unshakeable, then you will attain the state of yoga (union).\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou can have a proper darsana (view) of the atma (soul) when your intellect is firm in sama:dhi (meditative state). \nWhen can this happen? If you can attain this state, your intellect will be stable. \nWhat does this mean? If your intellect is achala (firm) in sama:dhi, then it becomes unshakeable. \nNext, if it is nischala (unshakable), then you can truly understand. \nA jna:ni (wise person) like me is explaining this, and I know things very well. Because of the clarity you gain from my explanations, if your intellect becomes achala, fixed with your manas (mind), then you can 'see' the atma clearly.\nLet’s try to understand three words here. The first one is sama:dhi. We are familiar with this term, especially after Covid. We often see it used in the context of burial, where the body is placed in a coffin and buried, making it immovable. However, sama:dhi does not only refer to this.\nThe mind (manas) can also be in sama:dhi. If you qualify it correctly, it becomes sama:dhi. \nWhen and how does this happen? Dhi (intellect) is that which accumulates knowledge. \nWhat is the place where water is collected and always full? Water exists in wells, lakes, and rivers, but these can dry up. The ocean, however, never dries up. \nHence, it is named as the place where there is water all the time. Water is called jala (water) or va:ri (water), and dhi means always present. Therefore, it is called jaladhi (ocean). \nIn Telugu, some mispronounce it as va:radhi, which is incorrect. The ocean is called va:ridhi. \nLet’s set that topic aside for now. Dhi is something that exists with. \nWhat should exist? How should it exist? In verse 2.53, Sri Krishna said, \"buddihi sama:dhau achala stha:syathi.\" He stated that the intellect should be in sama:dhi, the mind. \nWhere will buddhi (intellect) be? In the manas (mind). Manas is referred to as sama:dhi. Why? Because jna:na (knowledge) reaches and stays in the manas. \nHow does it stay there? It should resemble sama:dhi. \nWhat happens when it is like sama:dhi? It becomes stable, without any change. \nWhen we bury a body in sama:dhi, it cannot escape even if it has life. Similarly, for a manas filled with jna:na, the intellect becomes stable. \nLet’s say the manas is like a glass tumbler. We fill it with jna:na. How should jna:na fill it? It should fill the glass completely, leaving no room for anything else. \nA: (one) + dhi: (fill) = a:dhi (filled with one thing). \nSama:dhau means filled with one thing, such that nothing else can enter. This manas is filled with unshakeable wisdom. \nHence, Sri Krishna uses the term here, \"sama:dhau buddihi stha:syathi.\" \nWhat kind of buddhi is this? It is sruthi viprathipanna (extraordinary knowledge) because it is taught by Me and the wise. \nHow should it be filled? First, it should be nischala (without movement). \nThe Lord used two words - nischala and achala. These words sound similar, but there is a wonderful meaning in that. \nNischala means without movement, while achala also means without movement. \nWe fill a glass with water and keep it aside. What is the state of the water? It remains still as long as it is untouched. \nHowever, if the glass is moved, the water spills. If we put the glass upside down, all the water spills out. \nAs long as we are listening to a discourse, we feel stable and knowledgeable. But once we move away, we revert to our old selves. \nNischala buddhi is like holding a dog's tail straight. It stays straight as long as you hold it. \nSimilarly, as long as we are listening, it feels good. However, once we are away, our knowledge also reverses. \nNischala is when the movement has paused. We desire that there should be no movement at all. \nWhat do we do to stop the movement? If we put the glass in a freezer, the water will freeze. \nIf we move the glass, will the water move? No! If we put the glass upside down, will the water spill? No! \nPreviously, the water was still as long as it was untouched. But once you touch it, it spills. \nIf you can keep the glass in the freezer, with constant practice and reflection, meditate on it as if it were visible to you. \nIf you switch the power on for a minute, then off for five minutes, can you expect the water to freeze? No! \nIf you keep the power on constantly, then if you move the glass, the water stays still. This is achala (stable). \nPreviously, it was nischala (unmoving). \nSanskrit is a great language for this reason. Chala means movement, while nischala means that the movement has stopped temporarily. \nHow should the knowledge attained behave once it fills the glass of manas? Nothing else should get into it. \nWhat happens if we pour oil into the glass of frozen water? The oil will not mix; it will stay on the surface. \nThis means that whatever you filled in the glass is set firmly. \nBuddhi should stay firmly in the manas, sruthi viprathipanna: (knowledge obtained through listening). \nInitially, it will be nischala (unmoving). You need to practice that. \nAfter that, you have to take it to the next step. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsamadhau: achala: buddhihi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf the knowledge fills the mind and becomes stable...\n-----------------------------------------------\nWithout letting anything else enter it, then you are qualified to attain a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization). \nIf someone says, ‘sit for a minute, I will give you a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra,’ it just means he is using the other’s weakness, but he can’t give him anything. \nSri Krishna is explaining this process. It is important for the knowledge to be stable or achala. \nWhat is this achala jna:na (stable knowledge) called? It is beneficial. \nPrajna is the knowledge that is beneficial. If it is stable, it is sthitha (steady). One who has it is called sthitha prajna (steady wisdom). \nSri Krishna explained this to Arjuna in verse 2.53. \nAfter listening to this, Arjuna wonders with various questions. Let’s find out what they are and go further. \nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 115,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita elaborates on how we need to perform our duties. We need to know what benefit we get from it. When we perform our duties, we attain ultimate permanent benefit. What is that ultimate benefit? The one which doesn’t get destroyed is the ultimate benefit. Even if you earn a lot of wealth, it will all gradually be gone one day. If you reach high positions, even they will be gone one day. Even if one rules very efficiently, he has to let go of his post after some time. If you acquire mansions and buildings, either they will be gone or you will be gone leaving them. All these are temporary benefits. What is the benefit which stays permanently? That is a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (realization of the soul).\nThis term sounds very difficult. Why? Because we don’t know much about it (a:thma). We might wonder what will happen if we ‘see’ it? That (a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra) means to attain a state of bliss. It is not so easy to attain that state. Sri Krishna discusses it in chapter 2, saying:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthada: yo:gam ava:psyasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthen you will attain yoga (union), the final result\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe Lord says, ‘It is not so easy to attain it. If all the prerequisites are met, you may attain it.’ A:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra means eternal bliss. You need not think of it as a difficult term or feel as if the world is meaningless or it is ve:da:nthic (related to Vedic philosophy). It is a state which bestows everlasting bliss which increases as you experience it. The technical term for it is a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra. In simpler terms, we can call it yoga (union).\nSri Krishna instructed this in the second chapter - thada: yo:gam ava:psyasi. \nthada: - after all this happens. After what happens? The Lord discussed prerequisite processes. He began explaining those from verse 2.41:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvyava:ya:thmika buddhihi e:ka:\nSLOKA MEANING -\na fixed goal is essential\n-----------------------------------------------\nTo begin with, you need to arrive at a fixed goal. You need to be clear about your goal. If you need to achieve a gold medal, that goal has to be fixed in your mind. That is called lakshya suddhi (purity of aim). If that is there, other things happen by themselves. Here, we are not desiring a gold medal. In some places, what they call a gold medal is just of a golden color but there is no gold in it. Believing that it is a gold medal, people feel very happy about it. There are a few apps on cellphones; if you earn so many points, you will get gold, silver, diamond, or platinum badges. They send a colored picture. Looking at those, people feel happy thinking they will get gold or diamond badges. There is nothing in that.\nIn some places, we saw organizers giving gold, silver, and bronze medals. We used to think gold medals were made of gold. When we observed it, we understood that the inside was made of some cheap metal, not even copper, but is covered with gold color. That is called a gold medal. If it is white, it is called a silver medal. If it is in some other color, it is called a bronze medal. Even for attaining temporary things like these, we focus on the goal, keep other things aside, and work hard for it. In this case, it’s not temporary happiness we are seeking. “I need permanent bliss which never decreases.” It is a decisive goal, a fixed goal.\nTerms like fixed goal or a resolve are familiar. However, the term vyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi (determined intellect) is not familiar. Fix this in your mind. Try to learn about the benefits of attaining the goal. To have a fixed goal, we should first know that it is beneficial for us. To know that it’s beneficial, we should know the good qualities about it. Once he attains permanent benefit as opposed to temporary benefits, how he and others around him feel happy, how others will praise him, he should know all these. Then he should put effort into it. Just because you feel it is nice and you need to attain it, it won’t come easily. You have to put in all the efforts required. This effort is called karma (action).\nIf we use the technical terms from Bhagavad Gita, it feels like vedanta (philosophy) or religion. If we relate them in modern terminology, it feels like a personality development course. However, there is no other means than Bhagavad Gita to make us better. Those who are conducting contemporary courses are taking content from Bhagavad Gita and using modern terms to describe it. However, when we go to the original words of Bhagavad Gita, it seems very difficult for us as if we are drinking neem juice or something strenuous like lifting hills, and we feel disinterested. It is good to know them though.\nWe should perform our duties. While doing our duties, we may get compliments. Don’t get carried away by them. If you do, you won’t be able to work hard. You may get some certificates for your achievements. Once you get used to them, you won’t like it if you don’t get them (compliments). Once you get used to the compliments, if you don’t get recognition, you feel like crying. Hence, don’t pay attention to them. However, a lot of people encourage you towards them saying, ‘You need these things too. They are necessary. These are the means for you to grow.’ \nPutting in effort will make you grow. Praise, claps, garlands, or getting respect are not the means to grow. Why are we saying that? After getting used to them, we won’t like it if we don’t get them (commendations). If anyone doesn’t talk about us, we feel as if everything becomes void. Hence, the Lord said very clearly not to pay attention to them. All the things we said earlier like gold medals are drushta lakshya (goals with visible results), goals with ‘visible’ results. We are able to see both the result and efforts. If we have the goal of permanent bliss related to the soul, that does not have drushta phala (visible result). That is an invisible result. It is difficult to pay attention to or work towards an invisible result.\nSo what should we do first? Listen. What should we listen to? Teachings related to it, of the Wise. That is called sastra (scripture). We should listen to them and have faith in them. The more faith we have in them, the more it will result in clarity or nischaya:thmaka jna:na (decisive knowledge). Lord explained this in verse 2.53:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsruthi viprathipanna: the:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nwhen the mind is firmly established\n-----------------------------------------------\nFor us to have that nischala (unwavering) mind - First, we have to listen and then reflect on it. Have faith in what we have reflected on. Then firmly establish in our heart what we believe in. We have to persevere till that nischaya:thmaka jna:na becomes achala (firm). Even if someone tries to disturb it, it shouldn’t be disturbed and stay firm. Then…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthadha yo:gam ava:psyasi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthen, you will attain yoga (union)\n-----------------------------------------------\nDeveloping achala, firm, faith is like building an armor on the knowledge of the goal. Faith is jna:na (knowledge), hence it is called jna. It is such strong faith which doesn’t get disturbed by any means. That is called prajna (wisdom). How is this prajna? It is stable. It is sthira (steady) or sthitha (firm). Prajna is sthitha. Sthitha prajna (one who is steady in wisdom) is a person whose knowledge is sthitha prajna (steady wisdom). The quality in an object is called vasthutha (essence) or vasthuthva. Quality in a book is called pusthakatha (bookish quality) or pusthakathva. It could be told in both ways. What is the quality in a sthitha prajna called? Sthitha prajnatha (one who has steady wisdom) or sthitha prajnathva.\nIf you have this sthitha prajnathva, thada: yo:gam ava:psyasi. Then, you are eligible for a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra said Sri Krishna. After listening to this, Arjuna got a doubt in his mind. Where should this happen? In sama:dhi (meditative state), manas (mind). We discussed what sama:dhi was before. It is not a tomb; it means [qualified] manas. Why? It (knowledge of the goal) is filled in the manas. It is sum + a + dhi = unswerving + completely filled + wisdom. \nWe discussed an example before. The water in a glass when put in a freezer gets frozen. The water won’t move if we move the glass. If jna:na (knowledge) is like that in our manas, that manas is called sama:dhi. If we fix this jna:na there (manas), that person is called sthitha prajna. This is what the Lord said. Now, Arjuna has a doubt. If one is sthitha prajna, will he ‘see’ a:thma (soul)? If someone says, if you have a certificate, you will get a job. How can you get the certificate? You won’t get the certificate unless you have marks. To get marks, you need to have studies for which you have to work hard. For that, you have to go to a teacher. Who wants to go through all this trouble? Is there any chance we can get a certificate without all the trouble? By paying money? If we get it, we can directly go to a job.\nPresently, Arjuna’s state is like that. Because he doesn’t want to put in the effort but he wants something like a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra. Where do you get it? In forests? He wants to stop fighting and go to forests. From the beginning, he was averse to waging war. He is forgetting his duty. He doesn’t want to work hard but is desiring the result. Hence, Arjuna had a doubt in his mind. Sri Krishna instructed to become sthitha prajna, right? If he knows how sthitha prajna is, without going through the trouble of waging war, he can happily become a sthitha prajna through some recommendation. He wanted to find out who sthitha prajna is. He questioned the Lord first.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nstitha prajnasya ka:bha:sha?\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhat is the speech of one who is steady in wisdom?\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe can’t understand the relation between what was told earlier and this question. We might wonder why Arjuna is asking about sthitha prajna all of a sudden. This is the reason. Let’s try to understand his question and the Lord’s answer. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "episode": 116,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), When the leaders of nations participate in public functions, they are provided with huge security. They are protected from any stones or bullets which might come their way. They are provided with bulletproof vests. You might have seen them. If someone like a prime minister goes into public, you never know what might happen, hence they are provided with security. Probably you might have seen it on January 26th or on August 15th. When they address the public from the Red Fort or some other place, the podium is surrounded with a large glass-like shield. It is like protective armor. You can see through it. However, even if someone shoots with a very powerful gun, it doesn’t get broken. It is so strong. That is like protective armor or protective wall. That is also called pra:sa:da (fortress), a fortress meant for protection.\nWe all need a protective cover too. People with knowledge definitely need it. Because as soon as we think of doing a good deed, there are people who are always ready to cause hurdles. You might have heard of a story in your childhood. Once a Brahmin bought a goat because its milk is very healthy and if you drink it, you can do your work more efficiently. So he bought a black goat. A few people saw it and they understood he was an innocent Brahmin. They wanted to cheat him and take away the goat from him. We might have heard this story in second or third grade in Pancha Tantra stories. They stood in four assigned spots to cheat him. First, one person came and asked him, ‘Hey Brahmin, why did you buy the black dog and why are you taking it with you?’ The Brahmin replied, ‘I bought a goat, not a dog.’ Just to be sure, he looked at it once to see if there was any change in it. It was the same. So, he didn’t care about the comment and went a little further.\nAs per their plan, the second guy came up to him. He said, ‘You are not even supposed to touch a dog, how come you are taking it?’ That was in olden days. Nowadays it is a status symbol to take care of dogs. In those days, touching dogs wasn’t considered appropriate. The Brahmin replied, ‘I didn’t buy a dog, I bought a goat.’ He tried to confirm it. After the second person left, he got a doubt and touched it to confirm if it was a goat or dog. It looked like a goat. He hit it once and the goat said ‘mee’ (bleat). He believed it to be a goat but wondered why the other person thought otherwise. He started having doubts. After going a little further, the third person came. He said the same thing. Now the Brahmin was confused; he thought, ‘Is there something wrong with my eyesight or me?’ After going a little further, the fourth person came and said, ‘Go away, you can’t come here with dogs.’ The Brahmin thought, ‘Looks like I made a mistake. Maybe something is wrong with my eyesight or me.’ Thinking thus, he left the goat there even though he bought it with a lot of money. All four took away the goat.\nThis story teaches us that some people divert others from doing the right thing and get the same benefit for themselves. Such people will always be there. Such people will be there for everyone. Will you be influenced by them or not? Will you fall into their trap or not is the big question. Even for the common people doing general tasks, there are many such people [to divert them]. Imagine the trouble for a person who has acquired some knowledge, after observing the temporary nature of the world, recognizing the cause for pain, wanting to get rid of ka:rmic (karmic) bondage, and desiring to attain the permanent state of bliss. We can imagine how many attempts will be made to pull him back and degrade him. He shouldn’t fall for such things. They talk [eloquently] like… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nya:mima:m pushpitha:m va:cham pravadhanthe\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThey speak words that are like fully bloomed flowers.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDoes he fall for them or not? What should be done if he shouldn’t fall for that? We can’t expect that no one should talk. We can’t think of going to hills or forests to avoid that talk. You should live in the world and do your duty also. We should live our life, do our duty, and have to live in the world around us. However, he shouldn’t fall prey to such things also. So, what should we do? We should have protective armor. It shouldn’t be like the one which people wear when they go to space. That won’t work. Medical personnel wear PPE suits while attending to COVID patients. External suits like these are not what you need. You need armor that protects your internal knowledge from being disturbed. This is very essential. We call it with a term. What is it? To have a fixed goal given by sa:sthras (scriptures), and by the wise. It should be yielding permanent happiness always. It should be favorable to you and stable. \nHow much ever ‘sweet’ talk and attempts are made around you, they should all dissolve at the surface but not disturb the indwelling you. They shouldn’t impact you. What should you do for that? Just like there is protective armor surrounding politicians, similarly, he too should have such protection. What kind of protection should it be? It shouldn’t be something that covers him in a way making others invisible to him and him invisible to others. It should be a see-through glass. What is the purpose of setting it [protective armor] up in front of the prime minister? He should be visible to others and others should be visible to him. However, nothing should attack him. It should protect him. Isn’t that what we said? Similarly, there is a pra:sa:da (mansion) with prajna (proper knowledge) which is called prajna pra:sa:da. This should be sthira (stable). That is called sthitha prajna (steady wisdom). \nFirst, we have to listen to this. Whatever we hear, we should think about it. With our techniques, we should make it stable in our heart. Whatever is in our heart should be so firmly established that it shouldn’t get disturbed whatever anyone does. What is that called? sthitha prajnatha (steadiness of wisdom). The more knowledge we attain, the more our ignorance will decrease. What is ignorance? Forgetting what is permanent, we spend time behind temporary things believing them to be permanent. We feel, ‘Oh we lost so much time. We should have attained what we needed to attain even earlier.’ Such a feeling is named nirve:da (disappointment) or thapana (suffering). Sthitha prajnatha is achala buddhi (firm intellect) which can’t be shaken. \nSri Krishna tells Arjuna that it is only then one will be eligible to attain self-realization (an eternal reality). We discussed previously that sthitha prajnatha is a pre-qualification for a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (realization of the self). If you have this [sthitha prajnatha], you will get that [a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra]. How can we achieve this quickly? Arjuna has a desire to get sthitha prajnatha and a:thma darsana (seeing the self). Those who have a:thma darsana are always in a solitary place. Solitary place means forests or something. Let’s say if Sri Krishna said that sthitha prajnatha is achieved by those in solitary places like forests. [Arjuna] Thank God. That’s what I am desiring. I will go there. Why should I go through the trouble of war? Arjuna might leave this and go there. That’s his desire. He is averse to war. Dharmaraj and others don’t have such thoughts. Only Arjuna has such thoughts. He has to be told that war is his primary duty and he has to fulfill it. One shouldn’t renounce their duty. \nTo get a job, we need certificates. Nowadays, there are people who buy certificates with money to get a job. Arjuna was a role model for all such people in those days. He is desiring the same thing. Is there any other opportunity? If there is, then I will not wage war and go there. He told this in the beginning,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nshre:yo bho:kthvum bhaikshyamapi iha lo:ke\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBegging for alms is preferable in this world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nBut he doesn’t know that \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvane:shu dosha:ha prabhavanthi ra:gina:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFirst, the attachments in the mind should leave.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe defects are in the mind. They should leave. Jna:na (knowledge) should be stable there [in the mind]. If that is not stable, what’s the point in going to forests or mountains or swarga (heaven) or anywhere? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnivruttha ra:ga:sya gruham thapo: vanam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf the attachments in the mind are reduced, even if you are at home,\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhatever acts you do will become thapas (penance) or yo:gam (yoga) and it becomes a means for a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra. If that [knowledge] is not there, even if he is doing penance in forests, it will create instability in his mind. We have heard many stories about Vishwamithra. We have heard the histories of many other people too. Mother Si:tha gave a upade:sa (teaching) to Ra:ma about a great person. [She explained] how he got degraded by the impact of a knife next to him when he was performing penance. As long as there are defects in his mind, whatever he is doing will be a waste. It won’t be of any use to him.\nArjuna asked Sri Krishna a question. ‘Please tell me how sthitha prajnatha will be. How can we recognize a sthitha prajna? How does he talk?’ What is his mental state like? He asked all these in verse 2.54.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nArjuna uva:cha\nstthitha prajnasya ka: bha:sha:?\nsama:dhistthasya ke:sava! |\nstthitha dhi:h kim prabha:she:tha?\nkima:si:tha? vraje:tha kim? ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nArjuna said: What is the speech of one who is steady in wisdom? O Krishna, how does he sit? How does he walk?\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is a beautiful question. We discussed earlier that sama:dhi (meditative state) is good manas (mind), a mind in which jna:na (knowledge) is stable. He is sthitha prajna. For that person, ka: bha:sha? Bha:sha (speech) means va:chakaha shabdaha (describing word), a describing word. What is that word describing about him? What does he look like? sa sha a:kruthihi ke:drushihi (What is his nature/personality/traits)? Bha:sha doesn’t mean language here. How can we recognize a sthitha prajna? What is his swaru:pa (nature/personality/traits)? This is a question which needs to be answered. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nstthitha dhi:h kim prabha:she:tha?\nkima:si:tha?\nKim vraje:tha?\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHow does he conduct himself verbally? What is his mental state like? What are his activities like?\n-----------------------------------------------\nHow does he act, think, and speak? How are these three in him? Please let me know how we can recognize him. If that is easy to do, I will adopt that, stop waging war, and go there. This is Arjuna’s question. Sri Krishna gives a wonderful response to that. Let us listen to it slowly. Jai Srimannarayana!"

He asked, how does he talk?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna abhinandathi na dve:shti yassarvathra anabhi sne:haha \nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe does not rejoice or hate; he is free from attachment everywhere.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe responded in proper order in these four verses. He explained comprehensively the nature of a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (realization of the soul) in these four verses. How would one who attained it be? What would he do? How would he talk? The Lord explained it as Arjuna had asked, but we don’t know what he understood.\nOnce a guru gave a lecture in school about cows. He said a cow is a domestic animal and gives milk. It has four legs, a tail, and horns. He finished the lecture. Two students who were friends came out of the class and started walking on the road. \n[First boy] It is a cow.  \n[Second boy] Are you crazy? That is not a cow, that is a bull.  \n[First boy] You just heard in the class. Didn’t you understand anything from Guruji’s lecture?  \n[Second boy] Forget about me. What did you understand?  \n[First boy] I understood. Guruji said a cow gives milk. See, someone is milking it.  \nThe animal was there. There was a farmer there who started milking it. \n[Second boy] It is giving milk. It has four legs, a tail, and horns. It is also eating grass.  \n[First boy] Till yesterday, you called it a cow. Today after listening to the lecture, you are calling it a bull. You have to understand what Guruji says. It has all the qualities of a cow which Guruji described.  \n[Second boy] No, it is a bull. How can you call it a cow?  \nIt has all the qualities which Guruji described. However, on what basis are you calling it a cow? The first boy was unable to explain. Both of them went to Guruji. Guruji understood that the boy had heard the lecture but didn’t understand anything. Guruji had to describe the qualities of a cow. He recapitulated them.\nYou folks can tell what a cow is. Is it an animal which gives milk? Dogs also give milk. Is the one which ‘moos’ a cow? Even a cassette would make that sound. We can’t call it a cow. \nOn what basis can we say an animal is a cow? There are two identifications. One is the skin which hangs loosely under its neck. What’s it called? It’s called ganga do:lu (in Telugu). The second is the mu:porum (hump) on its back. If these two identifications are there, it is fine if there is no tail or horns. Even if it loses a leg by accident, we can call it a cow. \nSometimes, its milk might be exhausted or maybe it hasn't started giving milk yet. Just because of that, we can’t say it is not a cow. Hence, the quality by which to recognize a cow is called asa:dha:ra:na lakshana (identifying quality), which should be exclusive to that, i.e., not in any others. \nIf we call it an animal, there can be many animals. It need not be a cow. If we say one which gives milk is a cow, there are many animals which give milk. They need not be cows. If we say one which makes sounds is a cow, all of them make sounds. We cannot identify an object with qualities that are the same as with others. We can only identify it on the basis of an exclusive quality. Only then can we properly identify that object. Not otherwise.\nFirst, we have to listen to the lecture. After we listen, we have to repeatedly reflect on it in our mind. We have to persevere till what we are reflecting on appears as if it is in front of our eyes. That happens when you start listening to the Guru first. It happens when you start thinking about what you heard. When you think, you will get some doubts. \nIf Guruji is preaching for hours and if the disciple is just staring at him, it means that whatever he is listening to is not getting through to him. We also don’t know how much Arjuna is understanding what Sri Krishna is saying. If Sri Krishna is saying something, he may be understanding something else. \nDo your karmas (duties). As you keep doing them, the va:sana:s (instincts) from our past lives get controlled and finally get eliminated. All the va:sana:s should be eliminated. Only then will you have clarity of knowledge. Past karmas must be removed. Karma gets removed with karma. \nThat is why the Lord clearly stated earlier, karmaye:va:dhika:rasthe: (you have the right to perform your duties), you have to definitely perform karmas. Arjuna feels like renouncing karma and going somewhere else. However, Sri Krishna said that performing karmas is the first step and you should definitely do it. \nWhat is the benefit of doing your duties? Actually, you should do them without expecting anything. However, you also get a benefit out of it. What is the benefit? Old karmas will get eliminated. Dirt on a stone gets eliminated when you clean it with another stone. Same with wood also. Hence, first, they should be eliminated. They are like darkness. Once that recedes, we can see what is there. \nOnce we see it, we feel like hearing about it. As we listen, we feel like thinking about it and get favorable thoughts about it. We feel like preserving it in our heart. We want to ensure that it stays in our heart despite being disturbed. It is a whole process. \nWhy should we do all these? As Arjuna had the intention of renouncing work, though Sri Krishna has been telling him to work, it is not getting through to him. Even Sri Krishna can see that Arjuna is unable to understand anything as he is not responding. Like one-way traffic, it is only Sri Krishna who is doing the talking. It is not clear if Arjuna is understanding anything or not. \nBut he had an expression as if he was understanding everything. If you don’t understand, a different facial expression would come. However, Arjuna is not changing his expression. Sri Krishna is feeling as if he is wasting his energy with all the explanations. All of a sudden, Arjuna asked a question, ‘who is sthitha prajna, how would he be?’ That’s not a question to ask as Sri Krishna explained about it clearly. However, Arjuna is asking about it again. \nSri Krishna feels happy that Arjuna is understanding something as he is questioning him. Doesn’t matter if what he is asking is right or wrong, but at least he is asking something. Sri Krishna gets easily pleased. He feels happy if anyone asks him for anything. \nOnce a Guruji was giving a lecture and said, ‘All of you have been listening for so long. How come no one has any question?’ One disciple felt bad for the guru. Since Guruji said to ask questions, he felt he should ask something and stood up. \n[Disciple] ‘Guruji, I have a question’.  \n[Guru] At least one person felt like asking something. Please ask.  \n[Disciple] Why is the size of the nose only this much?  \nGuru thought he would ask something from the lecture. \n[Disciple] Why did God put it here? There is so much place in the back of the head, he could have put it there. We have mouth, hair, ears, and eyes on the front side of the face; it is so congested. \nWe can imagine how Guruji must have felt. He might feel exasperated and feel like hitting him. Arjuna is currently in that stage. When Sri Krishna said that one must first stabilize knowledge in his mind, Arjuna immediately wanted to know about it and attain it, keeping all other things aside. \nArjuna should have asked how to perform karmas or how many aspects are in karma. However, he asked, ‘How can one become and how to recognize a sthitha prajna? How does he talk? What are his activities and mental state?’ If you tell me about those, I will adopt that first. \nA child asks a mother for a mango. \n[Mother] It is not ripe yet.  \n[Child] What do you mean by ripe?  \n[Mother] It has to become soft.  \nThe child goes and squeezes it, makes it soft, and brings it to mom. Is that ripe? If you want to be a police officer, you need discipline. What does a cop look like? He has a nice cap on his head and wears a uniform. The boy goes to the market, buys and wears those things, shows his mom, and says, ‘mom, I am a cop’. \nThe way Arjuna is questioning is similar. \n[Arjuna] Tell me about sthitha prajna, I will see how to attain that.  \n[Sri Krishna] At least you asked a question, I will answer you.  \nThus, Sri Krishna is answering him wonderfully in two ways in four verses. Let’s try to understand them. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), to grasp a subject, we must approach the wise and listen to what they say. The one who is teaching should be knowledgeable, and the one who is listening should be interested. He should be a jigna:su (inquisitive seeker). You can’t absorb everything in a day. You shouldn’t stop learning because you are unable to grasp everything you hear. If you continue to listen to it with interest, gradually you will know what needs to be known.\nThe one who is preaching will try to preach in two ways if he is competent. He tells the listener that the task can be done and it can be done well. He tries to encourage the seeker and ensure he is not scared of the work. To do so, he first describes the means and how to do it. He speaks of the results next. First is the means, and next is the benefits of doing it. This is one method of upade:sa (teaching).\nThe second method is as follows. If we talk about the means first, he may or may not be interested in doing it. Since we are humans, we feel like doing less work and getting more benefits. For people with this perspective, we have to teach them accordingly, right? For such a person, they first reveal the benefit of doing it. Knowing the greatness of the benefit, he will ask, ‘What can I do to attain such a great benefit?’ He will try to do the required work properly.\nIf a person earning 10,000 rupees sees an advertisement for a position with a 50,000 rupee salary, he will feel like pursuing it. If the benefit is great, then we think of how to attain it. If it is said that they are giving gold for free somewhere, what do we do then? However difficult it is, we try to obtain it. Based on the value of it, we try to do that. \nThere was a movie called ‘Mackenna’s Gold’. The whole mountain was full of gold (in the movie). The water bodies, trees, rocks, soil, everything had gold in them. Once people came to know about it, many groups of people started rushing towards it from different directions. It’s not the movie that’s important, but the fact that once we know the benefit is great, we want to attain it. We think of how to attain it, what we can do to attain it, how to reach it, and we will certainly put in all the efforts for it. This is the case in worldly as well as in Vedic subjects.\nArjuna asked about a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization). Sri Krishna spoke about its benefit saying, praja:ha:thi yada: ka:ma:n (when one gives up all desires). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npraja:ha:thi yada: ka:ma:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nwhen one gives up all desires\n-----------------------------------------------\n[Arjuna] Oh, you get such a great benefit? \n[Sri Krishna] Yes. \n[Arjuna] Tell me what I need to do to attain it? \n[Sri Krishna] First, you have to control your manas (mind). Make it sama:dhi (stable). Next, dhuke:shu anudvigna manaha (the mind that is not disturbed by sorrows) - He said in verse 2.56.\nHow can manas be controlled? Control your mouth first. There are two purposes of a mouth. One is internal (eating) and one is external (speaking). Control them. Both are very difficult. What comes outside the mouth is speech. Controlling it is very difficult. We may feel talking is difficult and keeping quiet is easy. No! Staying quiet is more difficult. Talking is also difficult. If we know how to talk, then the next stage of stabilizing the manas is achieved. \nTalk only what is required, avoid what is not required, eat what is required, avoid what is not required - is it easy for us to do that? If someone is saying something, we get curious and want to listen to what he is saying. Words are so dangerous. Talking is so difficult, staying quiet is also very difficult. Both are difficult. Not just outside, but internally too. This is our first endeavor. \nHe described four stages in yadha samharathe: cha:yam (when one withdraws). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyadha samharathe: cha:yam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nwhen one withdraws\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf you attain the first one, you will get the others. First, if you control the bodily activity, then your speech will be in control. Once your speech is in control, your manas will start to get under control. Once manas becomes nischala (undisturbed), it will get to the achala (stable) stage. Once it becomes achala, you will immediately have a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization). No one can then disturb it. This process is described in beautiful order, top to bottom and bottom to top. Sri Krishna packages these four verses and preaches it to Arjuna. This is one method of teaching (revealing benefit first).\nLet’s see the other method. Arjuna was proud and arrogant thinking he was the best. Even now he is showing his attitude in front of Sri Krishna on the battlefield. Maybe no one gave him a chance to display it before. Once he committed some offense in Dharmaraj’s place. They made him undertake a pra:yaschiththa (repentance) for it. Of course, people repent and yet continue to sin. Arjuna has to be brought into a proper track. So, his arrogance has to be curtailed, humility has to be instilled in him, and steadfastness must be taught to him.\n[Arjuna] ‘Tell me what it is, then I will see how I can attain it’. This arrogance is not right. He needs to be told something that he can’t attain. First, a:thma:nye:va:thmana: thushtaha (one who is satisfied only with the self) [2.55]. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thma:nye:va:thmana: thushtaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\none who is satisfied only with the self\n-----------------------------------------------\n[Arjuna] That’s so difficult. How can it be possible for me? \n[Sri Krishna] Oh, you can’t do that. Then do this or do this. \n[Arjuna] I can’t do that either. \n[Sri Krishna] Then, at least do this. \nSri Krishna had to take this approach to curtail his arrogance. You might have heard of this story. Bhi:ma used to be very arrogant that he was the best. He went to get saugandhika pushpa (a specific flower) at Draupadi’s request. He used to feel that he could fight and win over anyone. A:njane:ya (Hanuman) wanted to cut him down to size. We must have seen it in a movie. A:njane:ya disguised himself as an old monkey, put his tail across the path and sat in a corner chanting Ra:ma’s name.\nOn his way, Bhi:ma saw this monkey’s big tail across the way. He shouldn’t cross over it. When people are sitting with their legs spread out or sleeping, kids want to cross over them. However, that is not correct. We shouldn’t do that. Bhi:ma felt he shouldn’t cross over the tail. Bhi:ma came and looked both ways. He saw the monkey. \n[Bhi:ma] Who are you? \n[A:njane:ya] Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram. \n[Bhi:ma] Take your tail away. \n[A:njane:ya] You can see how big the tail is. I am very old. I don’t have the energy to move it. Why don’t you move it and go your way? \nSince he didn’t have an option, Bhi:ma tried to move it with his hands as it won’t be appropriate to move it with his feet. It didn’t move. He used both his hands. It didn’t move. He used all his strength. It still didn’t move. Then, his arrogance took a backseat. Till then, he used to think he could lift anything. With all humility, Bhi:ma asked, ‘Who are you? Why are you here? I am va:yu putra (son of the wind personified). I have a brother called A:njane:ya who is also the son of the wind personified. Are you the same one?’\nIn the beginning, one doesn't care for anyone due to arrogance. This is people’s attitude in general. What should be done then? He needs to be given a shock. He needs to be told something which makes him feel that he can’t do it. After his arrogance is cut down, if he is then told what needs to be told, he may understand it. That’s how he did it. \nWe see a similar incident with Indra also in history. After the war with ra:kshasas (demons) ended, everyone felt, asma:kam eva:yam vijaya:ha (this victory is ours), asma:kam eva:th vijaye:thi (who said this?). Everyone was feeling individually that all this happened because of him alone. Just now they escaped after being beaten by asura:s (demons), they are feeling proud again. If asura:s come, they will be beaten again. Thus the Lord felt that their ego should be deflated. He took the form of a big yaksha (supernatural being) and appeared next to them. Not knowing what it is, they sent Agni (the fire god), the youngest among them. He went with pride. \n[Agni] Who are you? \n[Yaksha] I will tell you who I am. But first, who are you? \n[Agni] Can’t you see the fire? I am Agni. \n[Yaksha] Oh, you are Agni. What do you do? \n[Agni] How can you ask me that? I am a famous person. I can burn anything. \n[Yaksha] Can you burn this blade of grass? \nAgni tried his best but couldn’t burn it. He hung his head in shame and stood aside. Va:yu devatha (wind god) also went the same way. Pride doesn’t let you care for anyone. It doesn’t let us think if the other person is our well-wisher, if he is an elderly person, it makes us behave the way it wishes. This is pride. This needs to be reduced in Arjuna. \nArjuna asked who is a sthitha prajna (matured soul). Responding to Arjuna, the Lord said sthitha prajna is, a:thmanye:va:thmana thushtaha (one who is satisfied only with the self). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsthitha prajna\nSLOKA MEANING -\nmatured soul\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhoever is enjoying with a:thma (soul) in his manas, he is called sthitha prajna. Arjuna didn’t understand. \n[Arjuna] How do we get that state? \n[Sri Krishna] Praja:ha:thi yada: ka:ma:n sarva:n pa:rttha mano:gatha:n (when one gives up all desires from the mind). \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npraja:ha:thi yada: ka:ma:n sarva:n pa:rttha mano:gatha:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nwhen one gives up all desires from the mind\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe should banish all desires from manas. Jaha:thi is to abandon; prajaha:thi to completely abandon; sarva:n ka:ma:n is all the desires. From where do we abandon them? mano:gatha:n (in the mind). It is difficult for us to leave desiring external things; how can we remove those from manas? He felt this to be a very difficult thing to do. Arjuna has desires in his heart. He wants kingdom, domination over others, no losses in war, etc. All these are desires. \nPraja:ha:thi yadha ka:ma: (you should leave everything along with its roots). Arjuna felt it was impossible for him to do that and gave up on it. Sri Krishna said, ‘I will tell you the previous or the one even before that. I will tell you the fundamentals.’ First, he started at the topmost but Arjuna didn’t understand anything. So, he started from the basics. This is the second method of teaching. Telling the benefit first and then the means. \nTo cut down the arrogance in an egoist, the most difficult thing can be described first, followed by the less difficult ones. If you can’t do that, do this. If you can’t do that also, do this much. Sri Krishna is describing the four stages of sthitha prajna. Let’s proceed further, understanding them. Jai Srimannarayana! Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In Bhagavad Gita, when Arjuna asked, ‘Who is a sthitha prajna (matured soul)?’, Sri Krishna responded to it with four verses. Arjuna asked, ‘How do you describe the appearance of a sthitha prajna? What are his physical, mental, and verbal attitudes?’ In response to that, Sri Krishna uttered four verses.\nIn the first one, verse 2.55, Sri Krishna said what his a:kruthi/swaru:pa (form) will look like:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprajaha:thi yada: ka:ma:n\nsarva:n parttha! mano:gatha:n |\na:thmany e:va:thmana: thushtaha\nstthitha prajnas thado:chyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSuch a person is called sthitha prajna. Who? Whoever is satisfied in the a:thma (soul). \n-----------------------------------------------\nHere, the Lord used the word a:thma (soul) two times. We think a:thma is ji:va (individual soul). A:thma also means manas (mind). It also means innate nature. It is one term, but has many meanings. We should take the meaning based on the context. It is not right to question, ‘Why take this meaning, why not the other?’ There are four or five meanings because you can use the appropriate one based on the context. In this context, a:thma means manas. And the meaning for the other instance of the term a:thma is ji:va.\nThe first instance is: a:thmanye:va - in the a:thma (as per Sanskrit Grammar). The second instance is: a:thmana: thushtaha - with the a:thma (as per Sanskrit Grammar). A:thma is knowledge. It is in the form of knowledge. It should be filled with knowledge. Because it (mind) is filled with it (a:thma, knowledge), there should be nothing else there. If manas (mind) is filled with a:thma, where is the space for anything else there? If a room is filled with darkness, that means there is no light. If it is filled with light, that means there is no darkness. If it (manas) is filled with a:thma, anything other than a:thma doesn’t exist there. If it (manas) is not filled with a:thma, then other things other than a:thma exist there. If other things are there, then a:thma doesn’t enter it.\nA:thma doesn’t tolerate any impurity or any other things next to it. If there are other thoughts, a:thma doesn’t enter there (in the manas) at all. What are the other thoughts? My body needs to be healthy. I need money and a good position. I need mansions and vehicles. If these desires are there, a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul) doesn’t enter there. Then what should we do? We should remove these thoughts.\nIf we have to do gruha pravesham (house warming ceremony), do we enter it with all the ‘waste’ materials previously used for construction like rock, wood, sand, water, etc.? A:thma wants cleanliness. He will not even enter if there is anything impure there. What should we do then? Remove all those. We should then wash it clean and sanitize.\nAfter a long time [COVID-19], schools are reopening. What should the school staff do? They should take out any waste and do the repairs. Sanitize the premises and keep it neat. Then everyone will come. If we have to fill manas with a:thma, whatever was there in the manas previously needs to be emptied. What is manas generally filled with? Think about it once.\nLet’s say God appeared in front of us. It is difficult to imagine, but let’s imagine. Let’s say God appears and says, ‘My dear devotee, I am happy with your devotion. Ask whatever is your desire’. What will you do then? What will you ask? We will ask for some time, get a pen, paper, and start writing. Even if days pass, the list won’t be completed. That means we have so many desires in manas. Because we have all these, we only think about them. All these need to be emptied. If there are other things in manas, it can’t have a:thma jna:na.\nWhen it (manas) is filled with a:thma jna:na, other things won’t come in. We have the karma va:sana:s (instincts of our past actions) from crores (millions) of lives filled in our manas. Right now, we have them in our manas. We may feel like eating something like a fruit, drinking something like milk or water, playing for some time, singing for some time, etc. So, our manas is filled with the va:sana:s, instincts of karmas, activities from the past. Not just the manas, but the indriya:s (senses), the instruments of the manas are also filled with karma va:sana:s. Not just indriya:s, our body is filled with karma va:sana:s. What will they do? The ones (va:sana:s) on the body are very powerful. They keep pulling him in different directions saying that they want this or that.\nWhen the body goes in a direction, indriya:s also follow the body out of gratitude for allowing them to stay in the body. When indriya:s go behind (the desires), they take their leader, manas along with them. Manas is in a pitiable state of going wherever it is pulled. We can imagine the state of the person sitting on a chariot with five horses pulling in different directions. Currently, our situation is like that. When the body is going in a direction, indriya:s are going with it, taking manas along with them. Because of the power of manas, buddhi (intellect) becomes subordinate and follows manas. Not just following, but whatever manas does, buddhi tries to justify it.\nIf whatever manas is doing is not right, if what he is eating is not right, buddhi tries to justify it because of the power of manas. We see when some politician comes to power, his subordinates praise him; they do whatever he suggests. As long as he is in power, they obey him and do whatever is asked. Once he retires and comes out, he talks about ethics, and what is dharma (righteousness), and what is not. When working in the Police department, why didn’t he then say what was right or wrong? When on duty, he didn’t feel like saying anything. He wanted to punish those who are righteous also. He wanted to support whoever was favorable to the government.\nOnce he has retired and got whatever is required and feels he is safe, then he criticizes the government saying, ‘Government should have acted like this. We should have protected our dharma, righteousness, etc.’ What happened to all this talk when he was working? He was the one who was enforcing punishment on the one following dharma too. There is no answer when you ask a question like this. Just like this person used his buddhi to support those in power and degraded himself, our buddhi is also under the control of manas, indriya:s, body and tries to justify saying, ‘Yes, this is good. What can we do if it is written in our fate?’ Buddhi tries to justify it too.\nFirst, we have to clean the dirt in our manas. Once manas is emptied, buddhi supports whoever is in manas. If a:thma is in manas, then it (buddhi) feels, ‘What is better than a:thma? A:thma is permanent. A:thma is knowledge. Body doesn’t have knowledge. Previously, it used to feel, ‘What is better than indriya:s? Body is the means for dharma.’ If our body is good, we can do anything. We shouldn’t do ekadasi (fasting), and make it feeble. We shouldn’t forbid certain food items. It is our duty to take care of the body, hence feed it. If it is good, everything will be good.\nIn this case, it (manas) was so strong, hence buddhi supported it. Now, if a:thma is filled in the manas, it (buddhi) will say, ‘Who is better than a:thma? Knowledge is the property of a:thma. There is no knowledge in the body. It is made of inert things. None of the indriya:s have knowledge. They also came out of nature, mahath thaththva (great principle). Manas doesn’t have knowledge. It came out of sa:thvik ahanka:ra (ego dominated by goodness). Hence, a:thma is the proprietor. Now, buddhi starts supporting a:thma for everything. Buddhi is very critical. It supports whoever is powerful.\nbuddhi karma:nusa:rini (intellect follows karma) whichever way karma pulls, buddhi goes that way and justifies it. Hence, we have to correct karma first. First, do your activity properly. What happens when you do tasks? Whatever is accumulated, those karmas will start melting. Similar to how a stone can be cleaned with another stone, the dirt of karma va:sana:s attached to manas can only be cleaned by doing sathkarmas (good deeds). Karmas have to be cleaned only with karmas. It is said:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvajram vajre na bhidhyathe\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou can’t use a stick to break a diamond. It can be broken only with another diamond.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe va:sanas, instincts of karmas can be eliminated only by performing karmas. What kind of karmas? With sathkarmas, good deeds. When you are doing the karmas, if you put the right bha:vana (feeling) towards it, it will become sathkarma or a powerful karma. When you do karmas that way, sarva:n ka:ma:n prajaha:thi (all desires are eliminated) the desires you have towards a task, that you need the result, prajaha:thi yadha ka:ma: (eliminate that). It should become prajaha:thi, all desires must be rooted out completely.\nThere is a su:kthi (saying), by Pillai lo:ka:cha:rya ji [a guru in lineage]:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nadaya va:sana yo:de vidugaiyum\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou have to leave it along with its instinct.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna instructed this to Arjuna. Arjuna felt he won’t be able to do it. He needs to be shown an example. Telling him an example, Sri Krishna is encouraging Arjuna that it is possible to completely eliminate it from manas. He takes Arjuna further inspiring him. Let’s try to understand how He does it. Jai Srimannarayana! Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Sri Krishna explained to Arjuna the characteristics of a sthitha prajna (one with a stable mind and proper knowledge). We can learn how He does it by going through the four verses starting from Bhagavad Gita 2.55. One who has attained a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization) is called sthitha prajna.\nFirst, He has to describe such a matured person, one who has perfected his sa:dhana (dedicated practice). Sri Krishna is explaining this to Arjuna in verse 2.55.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprajaha:thi yada: ka:ma:n\nsarva:n parttha! mano:gatha:n |\na:thmany e:va:thmana: thrupthaha\nstthitha prajnas thado:chyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen a person gives up all desires that arise in the mind and is satisfied in the self, that person is called sthitha prajna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWho is called sthitha prajna? The one whose manas (mind) is happy and filled with a:thma (soul), and nothing else. He learns about ji:va (soul), its characteristics, its form, and thinks only of what gives him bliss, not other things. He thinks all others are there to facilitate this knowledge of the soul, but they are not his goal. His goal is to attain the a:thma svaru:pa jna:na (inherent knowledge of the soul). That person is sthitha prajna.\nWhen will that happen? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprajaha:thi yada: ka:ma:n\nsarva:n mano:gatha:n |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen desires are given up, then the mind will develop interest in the soul.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe need to observe an aspect here. What is He asking us to leave? Prajaha:thi yada: ka:ma:n (giving up desires). Ka:ma:n (desires) means desires, not objects or the experiences with the objects. I will not eat, drink, or breathe. I will sit somewhere and close my nose. Sri Krishna is not telling us to do this. He is not calling such a person sthitha prajna.\nRight now, He needs to make Arjuna wage war; He needs to make him work. That is the goal. But when you work, there is an underlying desire. That needs to be removed. That is ka:ma (desire). You have to work. But thoughts such as ‘I am doing it. It is happening because of me… whatever comes from this work is mine alone’ are defects for the task being performed. These thoughts have to be given up.\nHow should they be given up? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npurammunda:na patthu kala:yi adaya va:sa:na yo:de vidugayyum\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhatever is other than the soul should be completely left behind so that they never return.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSays Pillai Lo:ka:cha:rya, a great person in the lineage of Sri Ramanuja:charya. Actually, where do these va:sana:s (instincts) reside? In manas. Our manas is a huge store room that has all these. So we have to remove them from manas. We have to empty the manas. If we want to do some work, what stops us? Our manas, not the objects.\nLet’s say someone wants to go to a temple. Someone sitting next to him might say, ‘Why do you want to go to a temple? You will be wasting your efforts and money.’ Instead of that, we can go play or do something else. It feels as if going to the temple is useless. Where are you feeling? In manas. Why? By the words of the one sitting next to you. After listening to the one sitting next to him, manas thought about it. Manas is the one that decided the recommended activity as something wrong. Manas is the one that also made you do the prohibited bad deed. Hence, the one that is dangerous and the reason for everything is manas.\nWe have discussed this many times previously. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmana e:va manushya:na:m ka:ra:nam bandha mo:kshayo:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe mind is the cause of bondage and liberation for a person.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe one that can suffocate a person is manas. One which can make him enjoy freely is also manas. Manas is very critical. If this is favorable to him, nothing can stop him in the world. If it is not favorable to him, whatever one does will not make him happy. Manas is so powerful. Great personalities like rushis (sages) are also very careful with manas, knowing its dangerous nature.\nEven the great a:lwa:rs (saints) who became famous for receiving divine knowledge directly from God, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnenjame: nallai nallai unnai peththa:l en seyyo:m ini ennakurai\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOh mind, you are so good; if you are favorable to us, there is nothing unconquerable in the world.\n-----------------------------------------------\nPay obeisance to the manas. Nallai nallai - they are patting its [manas] back, saying it is good. Why are they saying that? Unnai peththa:l en seyyo:m (if you are favorable to us, there is nothing lacking for me in this world). We can observe how wonderfully a:lwa:r is managing the manas, a personality development process.\nOnce we praise the manas, ‘Who is greater than you in the world? What is not possible if you desire?’, the manas which was so stubborn before starts melting. Anyone becomes happy if you praise him a little. Who will be happy if you scold them? If you praise them a little when they are doing a task, they feel like taking on more tasks. Praise is necessary.\nHowever, if you speak of things that aren’t true, such as praising a one-eyed person that his eyes are beautiful or wide like lotuses, it is lies. You shouldn’t lie to praise. But if you recognize the actual hard work of someone and praise, if you hired him for one task, he will do ten more tasks. You might see this in a few people. There might be someone who is arrogant and uncooperative. However, if you could win him over somehow, he can do anything for us.\nManas is also like that. Hence, we should never fight with manas. We should never scold it or hurt it. At the same time, we shouldn’t give it whatever it asks and spoil it. Whatever we need, we should tell it in a way conducive to the manas. A:lwa:r says, nenjame: nallai nallai, he praised the manas saying, ‘you are very good’. Whatever opposition manas had towards him has gone now. Previously it used to feel whatever a:lwa:r thinks, I have to do the opposite of it. Our manas is usually like that.\nTry to do some good things with manas and see. You might feel you always do good deeds. We don’t mean that. Just sit in front of God and ask your manas to see God in your manas for just five minutes without any other thoughts. Forget five minutes; it would be great if you can think of God for just one minute. Think that in that one minute you shouldn’t remember a monkey or peacock. The minute we close our eyes, we will see a monkey [in manas]. Whatever we don’t want, that is exactly what enters the mind. Whatever way we don’t want, that is exactly the way things enter the mind.\nHowever long we sit, that half minute or quarter minute, we end up thinking of only the monkey. The more you want to avoid it, the more stubborn it [manas] will get. There was a Brahmin. \n[Brahmin] I can’t bear my wife. She doesn’t do a single task in spite of me telling her repeatedly. I ask her to arrange puja (worship) items; she makes sure there is nothing there. His friend thought about it and gave him good advice. He told the Brahmin, whatever you want her to do, tell her not to do it. He thought of giving it a try. He told her, ‘Don’t clean anything near the deity; throw the deity away.’ \n[Brahmin’s wife] Who are you to ask me to throw the deity away? She nicely cleaned everything near the deity. \n[Brahmin] You can’t get water. \n[Brahmin’s wife] I will get it. \nIt is her nature to do whatever he asks her not to do. He liked his friend’s advice. Whatever he wanted her to do, he would tell her in a negative way, not to do it, and she would nicely do the same. The next day was Brahmin’s father’s thithi (annual death ceremony). He wanted to make her perform it. \n[Brahmin] I am not going to perform father’s thithi tomorrow. \n[Brahmin’s wife] You have to perform it. \n[Brahmin] I won’t do it at any cost. \n[Brahmin’s wife] Why won’t you do it? I will make you do it. \nBrahmin was happy. \n[Brahmin] I won’t offer curries or pickles on that day. \n[Brahmin’s wife] You have to offer four types of curries and pickles. \n[Brahmin] I won’t offer vadas (fried lentil balls), fried foodstuff. \n[Brahmin’s wife] I won’t cook regular vadas; I will cook spicy vadas and sweet vadas. \nBrahmin was happy his trick worked. His wife cooked curries, vadas, sweet rice, and offered everything. \n[Brahmin] I won’t call any priests. \n[Brahmin’s wife] Let’s call four priests. \nShe went and invited the four priests. \n[Brahmin] I won’t serve food to these priests or give water to wash their feet. \nShe made him wash their feet and serve food to the priests. Brahmin was extremely happy. He forgot the secret trick. The secret is to say what needs to be done in a negative way. In his over-excitement that everything is going so well, he forgot the secret trick. The leaves in which the priests ate should be thrown in water or thrown in a pit; dogs shouldn’t touch it. He forgot about it and said, ‘Dogs shouldn’t touch it, so throw them carefully.’ She took all the leaves and put them near the dogs. Our manas is four times more powerful than that. It never does what we ask it to do. Whatever we prohibit it to do, it wants to do only that.\nHence, after going a little further in the ninth chapter, Sri Krishna says, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thmaivasya:thmano: bandhuhu\na:thmaiva ripura:thmanaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe mind is both our friend and enemy. The mind can be our friend if we make it favorable to us; if not, it becomes our enemy.\n-----------------------------------------------\nManas is our friend and enemy too. If you make it favorable to you, it becomes your friend. If not, it becomes your enemy. There are no friends or enemies outside of us; all that is nonsense. The actual friend and enemy is within us. Thus, the Lord asks us in the ninth chapter to be careful. This manas is very critical. Hence to make it favorable, Namma:lwa:r says, nenjame: nallai nallai - hey manas, you are so good; unnai peththa:l en seyyo:m - if you are favorable, what is impossible to achieve in this world? If you are favorable to me, there is nothing lacking for me in this world.\nWe should make manas do what’s necessary for us, like making a stubborn child work [by making him a friend]. Hence, manas is very important. We have to remove unwanted thoughts from manas; we have to transform them there. Ka:ma:n prajaha:thi, the Lord says in verse 2.55. Let’s learn how Sri Krishna is asking us to do it. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Sri Krishna begins to explain the qualities of a sthitha prajna (realized soul) to Arjuna, beginning from verse 2.55 in Bhagavad Gita. In verse 2.55, He introduces Arjuna to the quality of one whose realization has reached the final and fully ripened state. Why? Because if one knows that the result is extremely great, he will quickly develop interest in it. \nLet’s say one who is earning INR 1000 comes to know of a job paying INR 10,000. He tries to find out how to go about securing it. Because he knows the result, he feels that the efforts are worthwhile and thus develops interest. Therefore, [He declares] the end result: ‘the world applauds one as sthitha prajna, a realized soul’. Arjuna wants to know who that is? Whoever is…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thmany e:va:thmana: thrupthaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nsatisfied with the self in his mind\n-----------------------------------------------\nHow do we refer to one who has attained that? a:thma ra:ma (one whose happiness lies in himself). He must become a:thma ra:ma. What is it that is blocking us from becoming an a:thma ra:ma? The thoughts in us and the resulting desires for vishayas (objects of pleasure for senses). \nWhen does one desire for these vishayas? If these vishayas are in [the mind], then there is a temptation for those. Hence, what do we do? We must eliminate the desire for the vishayas. We can eliminate the desire for the vishayas but we cannot eliminate the vishayas themselves. Because we are living amidst vishayas. We cannot do anything to eliminate them. \nHowever, the feeling towards them such as… “This is mine.” “This is for him.” “This is because of me.” …these desires/attachments towards them dwell within, not in the vishayas. Vishayas are external [to manas (mind)]. Vishaya means the taste, smell, color, sound, touch of a pada:rtha (substance). These are called vishayas. These do not live in the manas. However, their respective va:sanas (records of their experiences) are in the manas.\nLet’s take a mango. Where is it? It’s not in the manas, it’s on the tree or a basket or in your hand. It has the taste. It has the smell. It has a color. It has a surface that can be touched. So, all vishayas exist in the [physical] world. Objects exist in the world around us. We live amidst those. There is no danger if we live amidst those. The danger is when they enter us.\nLet’s say we need to travel via a water route. That requires a boat. You must take the boat and it must go on the water. It’s not dangerous if the boat is on the water, but it is dangerous if the water gets into the boat. What happens if water gets into the boat? It simply drowns. You will also drown along with it. Therefore, what must one do if water is getting into the boat? He should carefully bail out water from the boat. \nHowever much water gets in, all of that must be bailed out. We must be careful enough to not allow water to seep through to the boat. The boat can be on the water. Not can, it MUST go on the water itself. Just because it is said that there shouldn’t be water [in the boat], if you think of throwing the boat out of water, where will you be then? So, throwing the boat out of water is unworkable. The boat must travel on the water and you must travel on the boat ensuring water doesn’t get into the boat.\nWhat that means is… We must live in the world. The objects around, the responsibilities and the related experiences will all exist for sure. In reality, a body is given for that purpose alone. Arjuna! You are given the body to fight in the war. Therefore, you must fight in this war. Don’t say you will not fight in this war. Don’t say you will give up the bow and arrows.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nrattho:pastha upa:visath\nSLOKA MEANING -\ndon’t break down and become inactive\n-----------------------------------------------\nDon’t say that. You must fight. However, what must you abandon? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprajaha:thi yada: ka:ma:n sarva:n parttha! mano:gatha:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou must abandon the desires that dwell in the mind\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou must abandon the karma va:sanas (imprints) and karma samksaras (tendencies). All of them don’t impact just at one level. As long as they dwell within, they pull buddhi (intellect). They pull the jna:na (knowledge). Such ‘pulled’ manas encourages the senses accordingly. Senses instigate the body. Body acts accordingly and accrues additional records. As long as they are in you, they will only add more records. It is impossible to cut them down. \nTherefore, what should you do? The feelings about them such as… “I am doing this for myself”, “This is only possible because of me, otherwise it will not be possible”, These feelings! He is advising you to steer clear of these. How do you do that? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprajaha:thi, prakarshe:na jaha:thi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nnot casually, but abandon them thoroughly such that they never return\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe discussed this aspect earlier. What do we do to get rid of darkness? We light a lamp. How should we light it? We should light it up in a way that darkness never comes close again. It must be lit so powerfully that darkness will never surround you again. Only then is the lamp useful, right? That’s when you can ‘see’ the objects properly. \nYou will be able to decide what should be done, and what should be avoided. Yes, we have lit it. Darkness is now gone. We will therefore turn it off to avoid wasting fuel. What happens if we do that? It has only suppressed darkness from ‘showing up’. If you turn off the lamp, darkness will automatically surround you all around. It will disable you from knowing yourself. It will disable you from identifying who is in front of you. It will also disable you from identifying anyone else around you. \nDespite everything being around you, the darkness will make you feel as if they are all useless, not letting you see them. If you desire not to be surrounded by darkness, then make sure the light doesn’t get turned off. Try to strengthen the intensity of the light. Avoid having to repeatedly light the lamp by making use of perhaps an electric bulb. Let it glow to the fullest. Then, you will not even know [of any ‘darkness’] within. There will be no room for any ‘dirt’ to enter. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npraja ha:thi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nabandon them completely\n-----------------------------------------------\nAbandon what? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka:ma:n yada:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhenever you abandon the imprints related to desires\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhenever you abandon the imprints related to desires, drive them away such that they never return, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmano:gatha:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthat dwell in the mind\n-----------------------------------------------\nNow that manas has emptied, a:thma (soul) enters it and occupies it fully. If there are imprints within, even when you sit to pray to God, it will suddenly ‘peek’ at some savories like ladoo (sweet) and jilebi (fried sweet) etc in the kitchen and then return. When does this happen? Only when those imprints are within, they divert it. \nIf we begin to meditate and don’t want to think of a monkey, why is that only a monkey comes to your mind? It is because the ‘record of not wanting it’ is in there, it pops up again. *HH says this in English | We should see that it is completely washed out. If we try to erase it out completely and succeed, then what else would divert the a:thma jna:na (knowledge of soul) you attained? What other factor exists that can discard it? \nLet’s say we are speaking with someone on a cell phone. If there is another call while on a call, the voice on the current call lowers and you get notified about the new call. If you ignore the other call, it will disconnect, then you can continue with the original call. When do you give something a chance to enter this? Only when there are other things that have already entered. If there is nothing inside, [then there is no chance]. \nIf there is a sim card in a phone, then there is a voice. If you remove it, [nothing interferes]. If you can abandon the va:sanas in that manner, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprajaha:thi yada: ka:ma:n mano:gatha:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nthen you will feel\n-----------------------------------------------\nthen you will feel \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thmany e:va:thmana: thrupthaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nsatisfied with the self in his mind\n-----------------------------------------------\nwhat Namma:lwa:r expresses overwhelmingly, ini enna korai vinam, saying “I am no longer short of anything.” We can also be happy in the same way. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nstthitha prajnaha thado:chyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe is the one who can be called as the ‘one with solid stable knowledge’\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is the one who can be called as the ‘one with solid stable knowledge’, not anyone else who has something else [in mind]. If it [manas] is full [with a:thma jna:na], it will not let anything else [other vishayas] enter. \nHave you ever heard of Vikramarka Simhasanam (the throne of King Vikramarka)? There is something called a Vikramarka simhasanam. Whenever anyone sat on that throne, it seems it would not let any thought enter him overpowering him by imposing its power. How righteously, powerfully, greatly king Vikramarka ruled, the one who sat on the throne would give such great advice as long as he sat on it. When he got off from it, he would go back to his original nature. \nAs soon as he got off from it, all his feelings would return. Sometimes, when someone is imposed with some ideology, it’s called bhu:tha:ve:sa (possession). If that happens, his nature takes a back seat completely. He speaks, behaves and exhibits attitude of the other bhu:tha (being). Similarly, if we are able to impose a:thma on the manas, everything else automatically will go away. Those go away and thus this [sthitha prajnatha] takes shape. \nIt is difficult to abandon the [desires for] other [vishayas]. This is the problem. Because they are all ‘hard-earned’. Some people do not feel like using a suggested medicine to cure a disease. If one advises a covid-positive person to use a herbal root based medicine… that can be had as a lehya (paste). \nDoesn’t matter whether third wave or what other variants of the virus like delta or delta ++ or black fungus enter, it is a medicine that can highly boost up your immunity to overcome any of those variants. Use some coriander seed and similar natural products in the recommended process, but one will not want to follow these suggestions. Because others recommend costly medicine and hospital, many tests, how can the other methods work? He will simply choose that method and go that route. He may not come back. We witnessed many such people. \nThere are many people who have got better this way. There are many people who have lost lives that way. Only a few got better that way. However, all those who used this method got better. High percentage of people who used that method lost their lives. Then, why are people preferring to go that route? Because it is ‘hard-earned’. It’s hard to let go. That is the problem. \nLet’s say we assumed something to be a 100 rupee note and put it in our pocket. We have been going around assuming we have 100 rupees. However, we realize later that it is a waste paper. What do we do then? Do we continue to keep it with us feeling that it is valuable? No, we simply crumble it and throw it out. Once we know that it is useless, we don’t even think about throwing it out. \nLet’s say we take something in our hands wanting to eat it. We then realize it’s a cockroach. It looked like some chocolate and he picked it up to eat. He immediately realizes it to be a cockroach. What does he do? He feels disgusted, and throws it out far away without even thinking about it ever again. Similarly, when we can steer clear of the thoughts about other vishayas in such manner, then manas gets filled with a:thma jna:na. \nWe might think that this requires abandoning the objects or experiences etc. No, not at all. You should give up the attachment towards them from your mind. If that is done, all these [objects, experiences etc] can become enhancers of a:thma jna:na. This is the matured, ripened state of sthitha prajnatha, state of a fully realized soul. \nSri Krishna introduced this to Arjuna. Having heard this, Arjuna felt that abandoning all these from the mind is not a simple task. He asked for another way. Lord Sri Krishna then introduces him to the second way in the next verse, 2.56. Let’s learn further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 122,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2, we are trying to learn about sthitha prajna (one with a fixed steady mind). \nThis topic spans 4 verses as a response to Arjuna’s question to Sri Krishna. These are verses 2.55 through 2.58. Sri Krishna demonstrates how a sthitha prajna is, and how his attitude is at physical, verbal, and mental levels. \nBeginning at the initial stage, verse 2.58 describes the personality of a seeker in the first stage. Verse 2.57 describes how he transforms in the second stage after he practices a bit. Verse 2.56 describes how that is in the third stage after he practices a bit more. Verse 2.55 describes the final stage where he completes the practice stage and attains the result. \nFirstly, He described the ripened mature stage followed by the previous stage and so on. Because scriptures described in this manner, Sri Krishna perhaps followed the same. Because Sri Krishna explained in this manner, our Goda Devi also teaches us the same process in Thiruppavai (30 poems encapsulating the essence of Vedas) during the phase of awakening the gopikas (milkmaids representing qualities of a seeker). \nLet’s keep that aside. In 2.55, firstly, He describes the ripened state, i.e. what is it like when [one’s] knowledge is fully blossomed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprajaha:thi yada: ka:ma:n sarva:n pa:rttha! mano:gatha:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who abandons all the imprints of karma (past deeds) from his mind so thoroughly that they never return to the mind…\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen does he abandon like that? If he develops interest in a:thma (soul), then he will be able to abandon them. It is analogous to how someone who eats tasteless food abandons it after tasting a properly cooked meal. \nIf we provide deliciously cooked dishes to someone and get him used to its taste, will he be able to have ragi (coarse flour) or gruel or something of that sort that he was earlier having? One who is used to eating smooth rice will have a hard time eating mudi biyyam (brown rice). That’s how tough it feels, even worse. \nIf one develops interest in this, the rest will not be appealing. If one knows this is great, the rest will leave [the mind]. [Imprints of] desires from the past will all be erased. \nIf a friend whom we strongly admire comes to our home after a long time, how do we feel? Despite being habituated to timely sleep and food routines, as you talk to him, the impact of your friendship with him makes you forget hunger, sleep, and everything else. Nothing else feels happier than talking to him. \nWe know of many such experiences in the world. If one is focused on something, as he keeps thinking about it, nothing else enters his mind. If we pour plain water into a glass filled with solidified ghee (clarified butter), what happens to the water? Water will not seep through at all. \nHowever, if water is poured into a glass filled with milk, water mixes with milk. Just as even a single drop of water does not stay in a glass filled with solidified ghee and flows out of it, when you fill the mind with stable knowledge about the root support of the greatest, most admirable word ‘I’ and the underlying jna:ni (knowledgeable), cause of all your movements called a:thma, everything else becomes light and unworthy. \nNothing else will enter the mind. Even if something enters somehow, it will not be able to stay in the mind as it gets ‘pushed’ out. Sri Krishna advises us to groom our mind this way. When does that happen? It happens when interest in a:thma develops and ra:ga (attachment) towards the rest decreases. \nThe decrease in attachment is called vyra:gyam (detachment). This must happen within. What is it like?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndrusta: anusravika vishaya vithrushnasya vasi:ka:ra samya: vyra:gyam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is said in yoga scriptures that when we look at something and a desire develops for it, or we hear something and a desire develops for what’s heard about, these are what are called va:sana:s (impressions) that fill the mind.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt’s not the object, but it is the interest in experiencing the object. This is what we must remember. This is what fills the mind. \nA desire for them has developed. Work on erasing this thrushna (desire). Then, it’s vithrushna (detachment). The state of a person where ra:ga (attachment) towards those undesired vishayas (objects) is shed off is called vasi:ka:ra avastha (state of mastery). He has then developed complete command over his resolve. \nHe is meditating on a:thma. He gained command over a:thma. He is thinking of a friend. He gained command over the thought about his friend. Hence, any other thoughts will not enter his mind. Even if you try to teach him something sitting right next to him, he may nod his head but nothing will enter. \nBecause it [that thought] is filled [in his mind]. Like we discussed earlier, water flows out when we are trying to pour it into a glass filled with solid ghee. Similarly, when he is filled with vithrushna (detachment), then everything else will leave [the mind]. \nYou may have heard about fasting on e:ka:dasi (the 11th lunar day of each of the two lunar phases). Some think it’s about not eating food. They do that anyway. If it is the love for the Lord that causes lack of interest in food and thus fasts, then it’s useful. \nSome people worry today even thinking about the upcoming e:ka:dasi on the following day. Despite eating today, he is simply worried about e:ka:dasi on the following day. He is weak because he thought about it. So, the next day he is tired. \n“Why do you seem dull?” He says, “e:ka:dasi”. He didn’t stop eating. He may have had more than sufficient milk and fruits in the name of e:ka:dasi. However, he hasn’t had the usual meal. Hence, he says he hasn’t eaten anything and feels weak despite what he has had. \nThe reason is the unfulfilled desire towards the usual meals even after having eaten everything else. He feels like he hasn’t eaten. He feels weak and sad. In fact, that kind of state is not e:ka:dasi fasting. \nYou are not feeling that way daily as you are having your usual meals. Instead, it is better to actually have a proper meal if you believe that will not tempt you later for it. Or knowing that God is greater than anything and thus filling your mind with Him, if you are not distracted towards it (food) at all, then what will you do? \nYou will think of ways to meditate on God by singing in praise of Him, or by staying in sathsang (association with devotees) with devotees who enhance the experience by singing and dancing in joy. Then, whatever service you do for Him gives you happiness but anything else that even touches your tongue can make you angry or upset or sad for having disturbed you for that second. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuga:yutham nime:she:na\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf you go away from our sight for even a second, it feels like a yuga (age)!\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey feel that the entire world seems to be simply nothing. They feel like it’s raining everywhere, unable to move. This happens when you firmly decide what it is that you want in your mind. \nIf you have what you desire and the desire for anything else is erased, then you have attained vasi:ka:ra (mastery) in what you wanted. Now, Sri Krishna is describing to Arjuna the state of vasi:ka:ra in jna:na (knowledge) in your mind. \nIf you can fill your mind with a:thma, and fill it with jna:na of a:thma heard from the wise, then vithrushna (detachment) with the rest happens. This is vasi:ka:ra dasa (state of mastery). It is a great state where a:thma is vasamu (you dwell on it constantly). \nThere are some in history who have practiced and attained this state. This is not only theoretical. There were great ones like Prahlada. Even while drinking water, Prahlada would think of God. He would not think of anything else. Nothing else would stay in his heart. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnavive: da:thmano: ga:thram thadgathe:na anthara:thmana:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFather (Hiranyakasipu) got the child (Prahlada) thrown into water tying him up with stones. He drowned fully along with the stones. However, his mind was not in a state to notice the water that surrounded him. He was always in union with Vishnu in his heart. He [Vishnu] protected him. Whatever was happening to him did not affect him. The Lord took care of it. So directly!\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf we think such a state is hard to attain, that’s different. However, there is an example for us. In the end, after Lord Narasimha appears, tears Hiranyakasipu apart and kills him, he was asked to wish for a boon. \nHe [Prahlada] asks Lord, “Swami, the manner in which people forget even You being lost in their interest in worldly matters,” \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthva:m anusmaratha sa:me: he: ma:pa vishaya:n e:cchathu\nSLOKA MEANING -\n“Bless me to have such sraddha (adoration) in You.”\n-----------------------------------------------\nLord said, “Prahlada! there is nothing new to give you. You already have that.” He declared. “Whatever you do, eat, play, sing, move around, you meditate upon Sri Hari (Lord) and nothing else.” \nNa:ra:yana manthram, Sri:manna:ra:yana manthram. This manthra (sacred chant) is all that filled his mind and nothing else. This is called the state of vasi:ka:ra. This can be observed in Prahlada. \nThis can also be observed in gopikas. Whatever they saw gave them the experience of seeing Krishna. This is out of love. The same can happen when one has hatred for someone. It was so in the case of Kamsa. No matter what he heard with the sound of ‘ka’, he thought of Krishna. \nThey [gopikas] also saw Krishna when they heard ‘ka’. The great one named Namma:lwa:r among a:lwa:rs is also the same way. “I am getting trapped in his ‘frauds’, becoming ‘useless’, incapable of anything”. \n“I will no longer even think of Narayana.” Out of ‘dispassion’, he isolates himself from everyone in the town and sits in a corner of a broken wall in the outskirts, to escape from hearing even an address like ‘Jai Srimannarayana’! \nAt the same time, someone traveling from another town wanted to rest. He placed his luggage exactly on the other side of the same wall of the house and settled saying ‘Narayana’! He did not want to hear the name of Narayana, and thus ‘isolated’ himself. \nHowever, he heard the same name. Because he has the name within [his mind], he heard it. If one doesn’t have it in their mind, it doesn’t matter what anyone does or says, he won’t hear it. \nSo, having filled it in the mind, impacted by it and passionate about it, not thinking of or distracted by anything else whilst surrounded by them [other things], not caring about them, what it means by ‘not caring’ is not neglecting any work. \nPrahlada did everything his father asked him to do. Yet, despite working [among other things], they don’t get carried away by their ‘taste.’ There are examples of people who are like that. \nHowever, the state explained by Sri Krishna in verse 2.55 that begins with prajaha:thi is called vasi:ka:ra dasa. This is the final stage, the ripened stage, in the process of self-realization. \nArjuna exclaimed that this is really hard. Sri Krishna then says if he can’t reach that final stage, He will explain the previous stage. He describes this to Arjuna in verse 2.56. \nJai Srimannarayana! Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), today we will explore the four types of meditation or knowledge states as explained by Sri Krishna in Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2. He clarifies these four types while elaborating on the stages of sthitha prajna (one with a steady mind) to Arjuna.\nThe first stage is called yathama:na dasa (stage of making efforts). The second stage is vyathire:ka dasa (stage of outer control but inner struggles). The third stage is e:ke:ndriya dasa (stage of focus on a single goal). Finally, the ripened stage is known as vasi:ka:ra dasa (stage of being established in wisdom).\nIt is indeed difficult to attain even the first stage. For one who desires a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization) or true bliss, despite the challenges of these stages, the resulting bliss is wonderful and avina:si (indestructible). Therefore, it is essential to attempt this journey.\nSri Krishna elaborates on the four stages in sequence, starting with the final mature stage in verse 2.55:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprajaha:thi yada: ka:ma:n\nsarva:n parttha! mano:gatha:n |\na:thmany e:va:thmana: thrupthaha\nstthitha prajnas thado:chyathe: ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever has shed all other thoughts from the mind in a way that they never return, has filled it with only a:thma jna:na (knowledge of self), out of love and not by force, and is relishing only that with deep adoration, is said to have reached the state of vasi:ka:ra.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Krishna explains that those who have filled their minds with the knowledge of the self are in a state of vasi:ka:ra. \nIn our current world, many are taking vaccines. Some approach it with keen interest, while others resist strongly, feeling they have little choice. It is inevitable, yet some take it disinterestedly. A father advises his child to exercise daily; if the child is too lazy, it is not the father who benefits from the exercise, but the child. Similarly, when advised to take a vaccine, it is for their own good, even if they have doubts about its effectiveness.\nSri Krishna's advice to Arjuna is for his well-being and, by extension, for the well-being of all mankind. It is crucial to understand what the happiest state is and to fill our minds with that ultimate thought.\nSo, what is the person like who is in this fully mature state, the vasi:ka:ra avasttha (state)? It is challenging to achieve, but if attained, no matter what work we do, the focus remains on the a:thma (soul).\nEarlier in Chapter 2, we find:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyasthu a:thmarathi re:vasya:th a:thma thrupthascha ma:navaha\na:thmanye:vacha santhushtaha thasya ka:ryam na vidyathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhoever has interest only in the a:thma is happy only when he perceives the a:thma. Whenever he thinks of it, he is happy. He cannot tolerate anything else.\n-----------------------------------------------\nMaharshi Sri Suka, who narrated the Bhagavatham, is a prime example of vasi:ka:ra dasa. Namma:lwa:r, Gopikas, and Prahla:da also exemplify this state. Sri Suka, born to Vya:sa, was a great jna:ni (knowledgeable person). As soon as he was born, he walked towards the forests, showing his deep connection with God.\nWhen Vya:sa called out for him, Sri Suka did not respond because his mind was filled with God. God is everywhere, existing in all beings. We often suppress this divine presence within us, wanting to dominate instead. However, God remains with us to keep us alive.\nWhen Vya:sa called out, the response came from nature, indicating that Sri Suka was so engrossed in the a:thma that he did not think about answering. This is how it is with true devotees; God responds on their behalf.\nWe have heard stories of great devotees like Meerabai and Sakkubai, who were so immersed in God that He would complete their tasks for them. Similarly, Hathiram Babaji was challenged to eat a room full of sugarcane by morning, but he simply meditated on the Lord, and God appeared as an elephant to clear it all away.\nSri Suka is a great jna:ni and a maha:nubha:va (great one). He is an a:thma ra:ma (one who loves the soul) and is satisfied only in the a:thma. In contrast, we often find ourselves unsatisfied, always wanting more.\nWhen one is satisfied in God, nothing else brings happiness. The true contentment comes from the a:thma, and such a person is santhushtaha (content). \nWhen one attains such a mature state, there is nothing else they need to do. Wherever they are or whatever they do, it is all about God if they are immersed in Him. This is the essence of vasi:ka:ra dasa.\nIn the play Sa:kunthalam by the great poet Ka:lida:sa, two types of hermitages are described: the divya a:srama (heavenly hermitage) and the bhouma a:srama (earthly hermitage). Those in the divya a:srama are in the vasi:ka:ra avasttha.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\niyam ka:nkshanthi thapo:bhiranya munayaha thasmin thapanthi ami\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe residents of the divya a:srama have access to everything that one renounces as part of penance to attain something higher.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey desire nothing, living only on air, unaffected by the luxuries of the world. In contrast, people in this world desire material comforts and perform penance for them, while those in the divya a:srama have everything but seek nothing.\nSri Krishna explains this state to Arjuna, asking if he is like that. Arjuna responds negatively, indicating his attachment to family and kingdom. Therefore, Krishna describes the previous state in verse 2.57.\nJai Srimannarayana! \nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In the scripture that describes the state of yoga, four types of practice stages are explained. The first one is yathama:na dasa (stage of making efforts), the second one is vyathire:ka dasa (stage of outer control but inner fickleness), the third is e:ke:ndriya dasa (stage of focus on a single goal), and the fourth and final one is vasi:ka:ra dasa (the ripened stage of a sthitha prajna, one with a fixed steady mind).\nLet’s take an example. The first one, yathama:na dasa. If we are on one side and want to go to a higher point on the opposite side, it involves climbing up a slope. When you start making the attempt, there are so many people behind you trying to pull you back saying, “Why do you want to do it? The journey will hurt your legs.” “You will be fatigued. Why don’t you happily lie down and sleep?” He takes a step forward, but because there are ten people pulling him back, he wouldn’t want to move ahead.\nWhen reflecting on Bhagavad Gita, your desire or love for worldly objects… remember, it’s not the objects, but it’s the desire for them that does not let us desire reflection on or attainment of atma (soul) or paramatma (God). It’s always about acquiring these material objects, living with and relishing these, and sharing the same with people and receiving the same. We don’t feel like trying for that self-realization or God realization. Even if we plan and reflect on them, the other things pull us back. It becomes yathana (difficult); every time he takes a step, there is so much to deal with to move ahead. It is extremely difficult.\nHowever, when he attains knowledge of these and realizes the temporary nature of the worldly objects, the eternal nature of the atma and paramatma, he develops belief in these, listens to that, and knows that the wise recommend it, then he wishes to try. When he tries to take one step after another, he gets drawn back. He then decides he won’t listen to anyone trying to pull him back and steps forward. The first stage is when one knows it to be the right path and is trying to work on it. Well, he is trying, but others pull him back. He is also slipping down at times.\nImagine one trying to climb up a mud-covered rounded iron pole with water being poured forcibly down from its top. If he wants to climb up, how can he? It is a rounded iron pole and thus slippery. It is soft mud covered, making it even more slippery. There is water gushing down over it, making it further slippery. He climbs up a couple of leaps. Water pushes down and he slips again. This is called yathama:na dasa, the stage of attempting.\nIf he, however, doesn’t give up and continues to practice thoroughly, he will then gradually climb up. However, even after climbing up a few steps, his manas (mind) peeks behind. He has to move in the forward direction. However, the manas impacted by the past instincts pulls it. Firstly, he wanted to listen to them [the past instincts]. Hence, the attempt towards eternal realities didn’t succeed. Now, the mind stopped trying to pull him, meaning it stopped listening to them. It developed interest in this [eternal realities]. Therefore, it didn’t want to care about them and is moving ahead.\nWhen it encounters any difficulty while moving ahead, it starts to look behind. If he steps back because it is looking behind, he will never be able to come up again. When it is looking behind, you should warn it and turn it forward and keep moving. This stage is called vyathire:ka dasa. In this stage, it feels like wanting to go back whenever there is a chance. The destination is 10 steps ahead. He stepped forward 2 steps. He feels like, “Oh no! There are 8 more steps. If I go back, it is just 2 steps. Why don’t I go back?” It keeps pulling him back.\nDespite that, he pushes forward, driven by the interest towards eternal realities. He continues to forcefully push the mind ahead in spite of it wanting to go back. This is called vyathire:ka dasa. He moves 5 steps ahead. He is now halfway through. Five steps in both directions. He decides to move forward as he has come halfway through. He controls the mental upheavals and agonies by not heeding, by pushing them aside, by paying attention but not attaching to them, leaving them, and pushes himself in the forward direction. He does not look back. He moves ahead. They [desires] try to enter [his mind]. However, he doesn’t let them in and gradually moves ahead. This is e:ke:ndriya dasa, moving ahead firmly believing that there is only one desirable goal.\nThe first one is yathama:na dasa. After he practices it for a while, he steps into vyathire:ka dasa. Vyathire:ka dasa is the stage where he is vyathire:ka (opposed to that). He is free from the shackles of the past. He steps out of them [physically], but his mind turns towards them at times. If he moves ahead from vyathire:ka dasa, his mind matures to a rather cooperating mode. This is called e:ke:ndriya dasa. This is also a dangerous state. He will encounter mental turmoil at times. If he can tolerate that as well, desiring to only move ahead, reflecting on the greatness of this [eternal realities] repeatedly, thereby feeling inspired and moves ahead, then he reaches the pinnacle, the top-most point. He will reach the highest point. This is vasi:ka:ra dasa. This is the desired state, but it is very difficult to attain this. Not hours, days, months, or years are enough to attain it. It’s easier said than done.\nFirstly, he needs to let go of this. He needs to detach from here. Despite being pulled back, we must turn it in the desired direction. We should move ahead and then reach the top. It feels good to hear. However, the great sage like Viswamitra needed thousands of years to reach here. He is the best example for all four stages. He started with the goal to be the master of archery. In fact, his desire was to overtake sage Vasista. To do so, he wanted to master archery to perfection. Because all his asthras (weapons) had been overtaken by the Brahmastra (invoked by sage Vasista). “I want to achieve that,” he thought. He wanted to attain the Brahmattva (state of being Brahman)!\nHe began the journey. He was in the first stage. During the first attempt, he encountered his nephew, Sunashvepa, and he gave away all the power of his penance. Yathama:na dasa. He made the attempt and lost it. He tried again and lost. This happened repeatedly. Every time he would begin, someone or other like Thrisanku would come for whom he would lose all his power. This is yathama:na dasa. He stepped a little ahead. He had the raga (attachment) in his mind. Hence, despite sitting in the forests, Menaka arrived and he lost interest towards the goal. He couldn’t live up to the second stage. He started the penance again.\nBrahma said, “I am pleased with your penance. You are now declared to be a Rajarshi.” [Viswamitra] I worked so hard all these years to become Brahmarshi and you declare me as a Rajarshi?! It’s similar to someone given a graduation degree when he worked hard for a PhD. When someone is promised a post in the cabinet ministry and made to spend money and work during the campaign, and if he is later appointed as a district chairman, how would he feel? He would be very angry. That is how Viswamitra was. [Viswamitra] I did penance for Brahmarshi and you declare me as Rajarshi? [Viswamitra] I don’t need it; you can keep it. He sat in penance again. This is vyathire:ka dasa. Despite the forces that pull him back from his goal, he turned his mind towards the goal and restarted penance to attain what he wanted.\nAfter some time, Indra sent Rambha to him. Earlier, it was Menaka. He wanted to see what happens when he sends Rambha. She went and made her attempts to distract him. He understood it. He cursed her to become a rock because she tried to unnecessarily disturb him. He could not control his anger. Thus, he lost the power of all the penance he did. He repented for having lost all the power of his penance. He began again. Having restarted, he crossed the stage of yathama:na and reached vyathire:ka. He now crossed the stage of vyathire:ka and reached e:ke:ndriya. He decided not to be distracted ever again and began penance. He performed penance for 10,000 years.\nAfter completion, he sat down to eat. It’s called parana (conclusion of the penance by breaking the routine of fasting). People call it breakfast. He gathered something to eat and sat down. The moment he took the first morsel towards his mouth, someone at the door asked for alms (bikhsa:m dada:thu). He must give it to the one seeking it. How can he not give when someone is begging for it? He stood up to do so. Then, he found that it was Indra in disguise of a Brahmin. He could have said, “I sat down to eat after many years. Do you have any sense…” However, he didn’t. He knew it was Indra. He said to himself that this is all he deserved and gave away what he had set aside for himself to eat. He did that despite knowing that it was Indra. Indra felt ashamed.\nSo, what stage did he reach now?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndukhe:shu anudvigna mana:ha sukhe:shu vigatha spruhaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\n[He] did not get carried away by his desire to eat. Sorrow. He was giving away the two morsels he wanted to eat after so long. [He] did not let it impact his mind. He controlled his mind. He took out everything else from his mind other than the goal of becoming a Brahmarshi. This is called e:ke:ndriya dasa. This is the state he is currently at.\n-----------------------------------------------\nAfter this, he developed so much focus that he wasn’t disturbed by the many other hurdles he faced. It was then that Vasista and many other sages prayed to Brahma. Brahma then visited Viswamitra and said that he is now attaining the state of a Brahmarshi. [Viswamitra] I don’t want this coming from you. I want Vasista to declare this. He saw Vasista as Brahmarshi and so he wanted him to certify. That is what his goal was. Finally, Vasista declared to Viswamitra that he [Viswamitra] was now a Brahmarshi and asked him to rise. He then stood up.\nWhere is Viswamitra now? He has reached the pinnacle. He reached the top-most state. We must remember one thing here. After reaching there, he wasn’t arrogant about attaining it by himself. He immediately washed the feet of sage Vasista as he had become his guru by declaring him a Brahmarshi. This is the greatness. He neither broke down when he didn’t succeed nor got excited when he succeeded. He detached from attachment, fear, and anger. He wanted to perform penance. He wasn’t carried away by his success. He was completely filled and stable with humility with no other disturbing factor; hence he became a sthitha prajna (steady-minded person). He was a great seeker. Because he reached that state, he could become a Guru to Sri Ramachandra. Is it a simple thing to become a guru to Ramachandra? This is the ripened state. This is the state of a sthitha prajna.\nWhere are we now? The second stage from the top, e:ke:ndriya dasa. Arjuna! Are you in this stage? You asked about sthitha prajna. This is e:ke:ndriya stage. [Arjuna] “I am so sorry, I am not at that stage. Please explain the stage prior to this.” We learnt the ripened stage [vasi:ka:ra dasa]. We learnt about the e:ke:ndriya dasa. The one prior to it is vyathire:ka dasa. At least, help me understand that state. Sri Krishna moves ahead to begin explaining it [vyathire:ka dasa] in verse 2.57. Jai Srimannarayana!"

He continues to work on accomplishing his goal. Because he is a karma yo:gi (one who performs duty), he continues to do his karma (duty). However, he is not affected by anything his body experiences.\nIn general, it is impossible to ignore the experiences the body undergoes. Firstly, the body undergoes transformations. Secondly, the mind goes through changes as well. The body experiences happiness and sadness when those emotions are evoked due to circumstances. He may cry, bawl, and bite others when he does not like what is happening. These are changes related to the body.\nRegarding changes in the mind, when he cannot do much with his body, he would think, “He should suffer in some way. How can he do this to me?” especially if the other person is of higher or greater stature, then he would curse them in his mind. We observe such deviations in the mind. Why did these happen? If he does not want to perform an activity with his body but feels obligated to do it as a duty, then he does it while cursing in his mind. He gets angry. He is interested in his body; he is forced to perform an activity that was asked by another. What can he do? He will do it crying. But he cannot appear to be disinterested; otherwise, he will be fired from the job. Therefore, in his mind, he would curse while working.\nIf anyone is told to work beyond normal working hours or to work during lunchtime, what will he do? In his mind, he will be unhappy, but being forced to work, he will work. He will experience a type of agony. This happens while he is working. Behaviorally, however, a fear sets in on seeing a snake. In fact, the changes in mental state are a result of identifying yourself as a body as you notice the other being/object. Otherwise, these do not occur. Snakes are not always fearful.\nImagine little children who are below 1 year old. An infant is lying down. A snake comes in, crawls onto him, and slithers away. The snake will not hurt the baby in any way. Why? We’ll elaborate on it later. When it comes onto the baby, the baby is just moving its limbs and babbling various sounds nonchalantly. The snake would ignore the baby and move away.\nIf a baby’s guardian sees the snake, then they will scream in fear. Then the snake turns around, tries to attack this adult. They then grab a stick for protection. The snake then evades the stick, jumps onto the adult, and bites them. Or they are able to hit the snake and kill it. Why did the snake not bother the baby earlier? Ever wondered about it? Why did it react only after the adult screamed? Ever thought about it? Because the baby never felt that the snake would hurt him! The baby does not have any mental reaction to it. As the baby never felt threatened, he never tried to attack the snake. He never feared, felt anger, hostility, or acted vengefully. Since the baby never felt these emotions, the snake too did not need to counteract. It ignored the baby as the baby ignored it and moved away from one side.\nHowever, the guardian had a reaction, thinking that it could harm them. Or since he likes the baby, he thinks it would harm him, causing a loss. That he would lose something he loves. That the snake came here to cause him that loss. Therefore, to save the baby, he wanted to cause grief to the snake. To cause that grief, he has to do something. Hostility. We defined what anger is earlier. Based on such reaction of the adult, the snake has a counter-reaction. It attacks, and a fight ensues. The snake is just an example here. There are people who are more dangerous. The harm can come from them. There are many objects that are even more dangerous. The harm can come from them too.\nWhatever it may be, when a soul indwells, it spreads the waves of reaction or knowledge through the body. Such waves permeate everywhere in the world. These waves are felt and cause a counter-reaction. If waves of anger are emitted from him, then others also exhibit anger. If waves of affection emanate from this end, then waves of affection also come from the other side. If compassion is shown, then compassion comes from others. Jealousy causes jealousy. Aggression leads to aggression.\nEarlier, in sages’ ashramam (hermitage), wild animals used to freely wander around without harming anyone. Even today, we sometimes see a snake and a mongoose moving around together. A cat and a rabbit are also known to move together. Lions and other animals move about together. So do fawns and other baby animals. When they are babies, they have no such feelings! However, as they grow, issues arise. Among animals, they are caused as they search for their food. Among humans, they are caused by attachment, greed, anger, and jealousy. Apparently, in sages’ ashramam, they did not harbor such emotions. Hence, no reactions and counter-reactions resulted. Everyone is focused on performing their assigned service diligently and nothing else.\nThe reason we have such reactions now is due to greed and anger that are evoked by karma va:sana:s (instincts formed from past actions), which the soul carries. Due to that, we are unable to fulfill our duty as well. We must therefore recognize this and tune our life such that each activity is performed as a service to God. Only then can enough strength be garnered to erase the deeply rooted feelings of jealousy, attachment, anger, frustration, fear, etc. That too, only if we concentrate on getting rid of these. Some say they are reduced to an extent by meditating on su:nyam (vacuum). Maybe so. No matter what, there is a need to disassociate oneself from these feelings. One must turn away from these and develop focus on one thing. You can set your focus on vacuum, soul, or God. Focusing on any of these, one can divert the unessential efforts on and attachment to the body and turn away from it.\nWhen one can reach eke:ndriya dasa (state of single-minded focus) or achieve e:ka:gra dasa (state of concentration on the target), only then can one be relieved from the clutches of these feelings. This is something we should be aware of. The mind should be devoid of these feelings. To demonstrate, a wonderful example is given. In Bha:gavatham, Sage Vyasa mentioned this.\nThere was a well-educated king named Rahu:gahna. He desired to learn Ve:da:ntha (the essence of Vedas). He wanted to approach Sage Kapila for the same. Being a king, he wanted to exhibit his grandeur. They traveled through the forest in a palanquin carried by bearers. They covered some distance in the forest. One of the bearers got hurt when a thorn pricked his sole and he was unable to carry it further. He had to move aside. It got difficult to carry the palanquin with three bearers where four are needed. They searched for a new bearer nearby. They found a person at a distance sitting under a tree. This person’s name is Jada Bharatha. He was the great king Bharatha in his previous life who was well-respected and loved by people from all regions and who named their region (currently known as India) after this great king’s name.\nThis great emperor Bharatha, who earlier ruled the entire region, is from the Rushabha dynasty. Due to this great emperor Bharatha, everyone in every continent used to claim that they belong to Bharatha! If someone is well-endowed with riches or in a venerable position, then many will try to associate with him, right? Similarly, these people claimed that since they belong to Bharatha, they are Bha:ratha:s, that they are related to Bharatha, hence they are Bha:ratha:s. Bha:ratha:s became Bha:rathi:ya:s. Everyone in the world used to think that they are Bha:ratha:s or Bha:rathi:ya:s. Later on, over a period of time, based on a region’s customs and lifestyle, people changed and they forgot. Everyone in the world at one point belonged to Bharatha.\nIn a subsequent life, this king was born as a deer based on his prior karma. During the final stages of the king’s life, he became deeply attached to his pet deer and dedicated himself to it. Due to that, he took re-birth as a deer in the next life. But due to the good influence of his previous life on him, he was born into a Brahmin family in his subsequent life. Even though he was educated from Ve:da:s, he did not have any interest in any of the rituals or activities. His only interest was in the knowledge of the soul. Because he was oblivious to all the activities around him, he was mocked as jada (useless). His name now too is Bharatha, so he was known as “Jada Bharatha,” Bharatha who is useless.\nThe king’s bearers found this person under a tree. They called him out, but he did not respond. He just stared at them instead. Since he is at least in the shape of a human being, they decided to grab him by his shoulders and forcibly move him up to the palanquin and make him pick it up. They dragged him to it, yet he did not respond and said nothing. He felt nothing in his mind as well. They brought him so he went. They put him under the palanquin and asked him to carry it forward. So he moved ahead. But he was unable to move in unison with other bearers as is required. He was just walking casually like he normally would. Hence the palanquin would not stay balanced; it wobbled. The one inside, i.e., the king, got upset. He said, ‘Why is this wobbling? Keep it steady!’\nThey responded, ‘We are walking properly, but this new bearer is not!’ The king got curious, opened the veil, and took a peek at him. This youth is handsome-looking and fine, but not walking properly. The king fumed, ‘Are you famished? Have you been carrying it for long? Tired? Why can’t you carry this properly?’ the king screamed. He [Jada Bharatha] kept quiet. He continued to walk the same way with a smile on his face. The king could not withstand this, could not withhold the anger, and admonished him. Yet he didn’t respond. ‘Hey! Carry me properly!’ said the king. Then Jada Bharatha decided to respond.\n[Jada Bharatha] ‘Me? Carry you?’ said he. [King] ‘Are you not carrying me?’ [Jada Bharatha] ‘Who are you?’ [King] ‘Me!’ [Jada Bharatha] ‘Are you this chest and body?’ [King] ‘It’s me!’ [Jada Bharatha] ‘Are you the head?’ The king jumped out of the palanquin, kicked the ground, and said, ‘It's me!’ [Jada Bharatha] ‘Are you the leg?’ The king was puzzled by his questioning in this manner. He could not figure out what this bearer was speaking about. The king thought, ‘His words seem different. Even when I abuse him, he is not responding. His questions intrigue me. Could he be the Sage Kapila that I am seeking?’ Having thought thus, he fell at Jada Bharatha’s feet. Bharatha said, ‘Without learning who you are, why did you venture out to learn Ve:da:ntha?’\nHe then taught the king about the knowledge of the soul. Bharatha did not get excited just because the king fell at his feet. Bharatha was not bitter with sadness though the king was angry with him earlier. He is beyond these two feelings. Because the king’s appreciation or anger are both meant for his body. ‘They are not meant for me.’ He even said, ‘I am in this body. The palanquin is bearing you. The palanquin is borne by its legs. Those legs are borne by the earth. How are we connected? I am in this body, and you are in that one,’ he said. He is well-versed in what he is supposed to know and has good knowledge of it. So he ignored the impact on his external body and focused on what he should be doing. This is his state of eke:ndriya dasa.\nNot being carried away by bodily impacts and not holding back on performing his duties, he focused on the indwelling soul, with e:ke:ndriya drishti (single-minded focus). Jada Bharatha is the best example of the one who attained the stage just before that of stitha prajna (steady mind), e:ka:gra drishti (focused vision) or e:ke:ndriya drishti. Lord Krishna asked, ‘Hey Arjuna! Are you in that state? Are you a stitha prajna?’ ‘No, I am not.’ ‘If not, then you should try to become a stitha prajna.’ ‘I probably won’t be able to get there. But is there any prior [easier] states than this one?’ ‘Ok, I will share that.’ ‘What is that prior state?’ ‘The state prior to eke:ndriya dasa is vyathire:ka dasa. I will teach you this. Listen.’ Saying this, Sri Krishna began to explain verse 2.57 to Arjuna.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Sri Krishna is explaining to Arjuna about the stages of sthitha prajna (steady mind) in Chapter 2. The most advanced stage of that is the vasi:ka:ra (one who has control over the senses) stage, which the Lord describes. Arjuna feels he is not in that stage and asks Sri Krishna to describe the prior stage.\nWhoever doesn’t feel sad in his manas (mind) despite encountering sad situations, and whoever doesn’t feel excited in his manas when encountering joyous situations, he is sthitha prajna. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m  \nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI bow repeatedly to Sri Rama, who removes all obstacles and bestows all wealth.\n-----------------------------------------------\n[Sri Krishna] Are you in this state [of sthitha prajna]? \n[Arjuna] How is it possible not to feel that? \n[Sri Krishna] Happiness and sorrow are linked to the body. Out of love for the body, you feel like protecting it from whoever harms the body by resisting them somehow. You also feel that your body should always exist. That state has to change. You should become vi:tha ra:ga bhaya kro:dha (freed from attachment, fear, and anger). Then you will become sthitha prajna.\nArjuna doesn’t have that stage either. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:tha:nna hanthu michchami ghanathopi madhusu:dana\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI do not wish to kill them, even if they kill me, O Madhusudana (Krishna).\n-----------------------------------------------\nArjuna said this in the beginning of the second chapter itself, that he loves his grandfather and guru… and whatever happens, he is not going to fight them, which means he has ra:ga (attachment). Not only that, he is averse to the situation which encourages war. He is also afraid that after he leaves the body, he might go to hell, which he doesn’t like. Not only that, he is angry at the people who brought about this situation. He has all these feelings. He doesn’t have that state at all.\nSri Krishna said, you should have a mature stage like Jada Bharatha. If you have that, it means at least you have attained the second highest stage. We learned that Jada Bharatha is a great and powerful personality. If anyone worshiped him, he wouldn’t feel happiness or respect towards the other person. If anyone troubled him, he wouldn’t be annoyed or feel like retorting.\nThere is a beautiful incident about Jada Bharatha. Once a few folks took him to offer him as bali (sacrifice) to Ka:lika Devi. Initially, they thought of offering some other person as bali. When offering as a sacrifice, that person should have all the body parts intact. That person had a finger missing. They felt that they can’t offer him as a sacrifice as a body part, his finger, is missing and drove him away. But since arrangements had been made for the sacrifice, they had to replace that person to be sacrificed. When they looked for someone, they found Jada Bharatha. They looked to see if any of his body parts were missing. They found him healthy and with all the body parts intact. They tied him up to take him. Jada Bharatha didn’t even try to free himself when they were tying him up because he didn’t have ruchi (interest) in anything related to the body. Even when his body encountered sorrowful situations, he didn’t think of freeing himself from it. Hence, dhu:khe:shu anudvijna manaha (he didn’t have any negative feelings in his mind).\nThey took him and tied him up in front of Ka:lika Devi. They applied some colors on him and tied neem leaves on him. They danced and got drunk. However, Jada Bharatha is a great brahma jna:ni (realized soul). They were making these sacrifices for some inferior benefits. These sacrifices are usually done by only such folks. Whoever has knowledge about God will not indulge in animal or human sacrifices. Whoever does those sacrifices is not interested in God for sure. Such people pray to the inferior devathas (celestial beings) who are called ga:na:pathyams. The people in the forest who were there were also like that. They took this boy and tied him there. There was some time left before they could sacrifice him. There was a big commotion there, with everyone drinking and dancing.\nJust when they were about to use the knife and offer him as a sacrifice… They were offering him to bhadra ka:li devi, who is a de:vatha (celestial being), superior to Ka:lika Devi. Ka:lika Devi felt, ‘If they give this person who has surrendered to God in sacrifice to me and if I accept it, I will lose God’s grace, hence, I cannot accept someone like him.’ At the time of the sacrifice, Ka:lika Devi appeared there, punished those who were harassing Jada Bharatha, made them free him, offer obeisances, and give Jada Bharatha all respects. Jada Bharatha didn’t become ecstatic when things turned out this way.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsukhe:shu vigatha spruhaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe is free from desires even in happiness.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis is the e:ke:ndriya (one who has control over the senses) stage. [Sri Krishna] You wanted to become sthitha prajna. You thought that if you become sthitha prajna, you could forget about the war and sit in dhyana (meditation) somewhere. This is what a sthitha prajna is like. Only he would be called a knowledgeable one. Do you have this [mental] state? \n[Arjuna] No, I am not in that state. There is no chance for that level of mananam (constant reflection of proper knowledge). Can you tell me the state prior to that which is easier for me to implement? \n[Sri Krishna] OK. We said that the stage prior to this is vyathire:ka (the stage of separation) stage. At least attain that. \n[Arjuna] Tell me how a person in vyathire:ka stage would be? How would he talk? \nSri Krishna is responding to him about how he talks in verse 2.57.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyassarvathra anabhisnehaha thath thath pra:pya subha:subham  \nna abhinandathi na dve:shti: thasya prajna: prathishttitha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOne who is not attached to anything, who does not rejoice or hate upon obtaining good or bad, is a person of steady wisdom.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe is trying to keep his jna:na (knowledge) nischala (stable). We spoke about two states of jna:na in the past, you might remember them, achala (unmoving) and nischala. What is the state of water in a glass when put aside undisturbed? It would be nischala, steady. However, once you touch it, it moves. If you tilt it, it spills. This is like nischala jna:na. What is the state of water when it is achala? It is like frozen water. If you move the glass, turn it upside down, or tilt it, water doesn’t spill. That is achala stage. The stage before the achala stage is the nischala stage. Sri Krishna is comparing this nischala stage to the vyathire:ka stage. What is that like?\nyassarvathra anabhisnehaha (he is not very attached to anything) \nthath thath pra:pya subha:subham (when performing karma yoga, perfected actions as a means, we get some benefits and some losses). What do we do then? If we encounter something we like, we feel like saying, ‘oh, this is so good.’ If we are distanced from something we like, we say, ‘oh, this is not good’. Don’t we say that? Abhinandana (appreciation), dve:sham (hatred). We have to observe why he appreciates or hates something. If someone gets us an apple, we say to the person who gave it, ‘the apple is very good.’ It means ‘please get it tomorrow also.’ Why do you say that? It may not look good if you don’t say it. What do you mean by it won’t be good? He won’t get it tomorrow because he might feel unappreciated. Then he won’t get it again. It means you have ruchi (interest) in the fruit. Because you have ruchi, you will praise the person who brought it [apple]. Because you praise him, he will be happy and get one more for you. \nLet’s say he got you something else. You scolded him for bringing something like that. Because you don’t have ruchi towards that, you scolded him not to get something like that again. In the world, as we perform tasks with this body, we encounter favorable and at other times, unfavorable things. As it is our duty, we should accept both. Let’s say someone joined a job in the military with great enthusiasm. If they posted him in a place like Hyderabad where he could get some additional benefits, he would be happy. All comforts would be there. If they posted him in Ladakh on the China border, there would be inconveniences and fights every day. There, he would be angry and might feel like answering back to the officers. If they transfer him from that place to Hyderabad, he would thank them for doing him a favor. Because if he gets transferred again, he wants to go to a good place like this again. He wants to be on good terms with the other person. \nWhy is he feeling abhinandana and dvesham? Because he has set feelings of like and dislike towards a few things. Who is the one liking and disliking something? It is the body that favors and dislikes something. Arjuna is feeling the same. If he wages war, all the relatives of his body will perish. [Arjuna] Their bodies will get hurt with arrows. They will lose their lives. Hence I don’t like it. If I don’t wage war, people will praise me. If I wage war, people may criticize me. He wants praise, not criticism. He wants relatives and doesn’t want their death. He prefers not performing the task as opposed to performing it. If he is in such a state, he cannot progress [towards sthitha prajna].\nYou may face favorable or unfavorable circumstances. Sometimes you may fall back, but you have to try again. yassarvathra anabhisne:haha (all this is a result of the love you have towards it). What if you don’t have that love? Let’s say someone brought mangoes. You didn’t thank him or show him any appreciation. If you showed appreciation, he would feel like getting them again. You didn’t do that and continued doing your work. He won’t get it tomorrow as he might feel you didn’t recognize his efforts. You wanted to talk to him out of your attachment to the fruit. Out of the attachment to the pleasure which you get when you enjoy the fruit. If you don’t appreciate him, he won’t get it. You should feel, ‘it is fine. I have what is mine.’ You should feel it is immaterial whether he gives it to you or not. When you feel that way, you won’t feel like criticizing or praising. If you are doing that, it means you are attached to it [fruit]. Then you are not sthitha prajna. You are not the one who has a:thma dhya:na (focus on the soul), but one who has daihika sukha dhya:na (focus on pleasures of the body). Hence your prajna (good knowledge) is not stable though it is nischala (undisturbed) until moved. It is like the water in the glass which is stable if you don’t touch it. However, if you touch it, they are spilling over and moving.\n[Sri Krishna] Do you have that stable state? \n[Arjuna] No, I still don’t have that. \n[Sri Krishna] OK. If you don’t have it, try to attain it. \n[Arjuna] That’s difficult. Let me know if there is any stage prior to that. \n[Sri Krishna] OK, I will tell you. The one prior to that is yathma:na dasa (first stage). He said he will explain that in verse 2.58. Let's learn about it in detail and go further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita is the best scripture that teaches us wonderful means. How can one control manas (mind), indriya:s (senses), and de:ha (body)? What is the process to establish a goal? What should we set as the goal? How can we progress towards the goal with sa:dhana (dedicated practice)? Bhagavad Gita clearly explains all these aspects. \nEspecially in chapter 2, with Arjuna as a means, Sri Krishna clearly explains this to all of us. Fix a goal. Start putting in efforts to reach that goal. You won’t be successful right after you start, but don’t stop. Once you fix the goal, continue your journey towards it. There will be a few people who may help you move towards the goal and some who may distract you from it. Don’t lose your energy in praising them or criticizing them. \nIrrespective of favorable or unfavorable experiences, continue with your efforts and move forward. However, we can’t be like that. If they do good, we praise them. If they do bad, we criticize them. The reason is that the manas (mind) gets disturbed. After doing sa:dhana for some time, you will be able to control your tongue from praising or criticizing them. However, you will continue to be disturbed in manas. Because of sa:dhana, you will gain control of external reactions but not of the mind. \nBecause of those negative feelings in manas, you will feel drained. You will feel more drained from the negative feelings than from physical work. Why do you want to waste your energy like that? Hence, even if someone is favorable or unfavorable to you, don’t think much of it. With the help of sa:dhana, if you can maintain equilibrium this way for a period of time, your manas will get under control. Then you can attain whatever you wish, whether it is worldly things, a:thma (soul), or God. This is what Sri Krishna wants to convey.\nThe Lord is showing an example for this in Bhagavad Gita, terming it as sthitha prajnatha (the state of one with a fixed steady mind). In this sthitha prajnatha, He explained vasi:ka:ra:na (control of the mind) giving Sri Suka as an example. We also deliberated upon Viswamitra as an example. Prior to this, He spoke about the e:ke:ndriya (one-sense) stage. We studied Jada Bharatha as an example for that. The great person, King Janaka, is given as an example for the stage prior to that. \nHe also started his sa:dhana. There was no one distracting him. Around him, there were a few people favorable to him. However, he would not appreciate or criticize anyone. He would focus on his work of ruling the kingdom. Since he was the ruler, a few people would come and offer him gifts. He wouldn’t praise them. There would be some miscreants. He would punish them, but he would not hate them in his manas. If they pleaded with him, he would become warm-hearted towards them again. Thus, his manas was in his control.\nHis mind wouldn’t get disturbed because he perfected the stage before that. King Janaka is a disciple of Sage Ya:jnavalkya. He stayed in his Guru’s ashram (hermitage) and studied there. The ashram used to be in a forest next to the kingdom. He was a king’s son, and the palace and forts were visible from there. He used to study along with other students. The Guru always focused on him while teaching. Generally, other students would get angry with that. They used to whisper amongst themselves, “You look at Janaka always because he is the king's son; he might be giving some gifts.” \n“Hence, out of love for him, you look at him.” They used to sit in the class with sad faces. However, the Guru never had such thoughts and wouldn’t have such thoughts also. He used to teach everyone, but others used to feel this way. Hence, they couldn’t understand what was being taught as they used to feel bad. They couldn’t have dha:ra:na (retention). If you fill it [manas] with unnecessary things, then what needs to be there can’t get in. Hence, they couldn’t learn. \nAs Janaka never had any such thoughts, he could retain whatever was being taught. Though everyone was suspicious of him, he wouldn’t have any negative feelings in his heart. The Guru came to know that all other students were having such negative feelings. He had to relieve them of such feelings and make them realize the truth. One day, the Guru used his yogic power to make them believe that the resident quarters or huts of students, which were near the tree under which they were studying, had caught fire. \nThe lesson was going on. They didn’t even take permission and ran towards their quarters. What is there in those? Not much. They used to wear only leaves, not even clothes. It is fine if they get destroyed. They didn’t have books in those days. Hence, there was nothing of worth there. However, they thought of them as everything; they didn’t even take permission from the Guru who gives them knowledge and ran towards them with the intention of saving them. When they went there, they found everything to be fine and returned back. Without taking permission from the Guru, they sat down and resumed their learning. The Guru observed this.\nJanaka’s city is the city of Mithila. After two days, with his yogic power, the Guru made them believe that the towers of Mithila’s fort had caught fire. The Guru was teaching the lesson. Janaka was intently listening to it. He was noting down important points. Other students also seemed to be noting down, but their focus was outside, not on the lesson. When they saw that the City of Mithila was burning, they made a hue and cry about it. The lesson was going on. After the Guru found out the reason for the commotion, he asked Janaka, who was listening to the lesson, “It seems your city is getting burned down. Do you want to go and check it?” \nJanaka said, “It is a big city. If it catches fire, there will be people to put off the fire.” mithilaya:m pradhagdha:ya:m na me kinchith pradhahyathe (In Mithila, whatever is mine has not been burnt, though my city may get burnt). “What is mine is the knowledge which you are teaching and which I am carefully preserving in my heart.” Others ran without taking permission, seeing ‘their’ huts burn. However, even after being ordered by the Guru that his kingdom is burning and he should check it, Janaka didn’t go because he didn’t have ruchi (affection) towards it. He didn’t worry about it as he wasn’t attached to it.\nJanaka left to rule his kingdom, leaving the gurukula (hermitage), after he came of age. Still, when his Guru had to give an example of one with ripened knowledge in Karma Yoga (Perfected Actions as a Means), he would always refer to Janaka. Other students got upset and said, “You always used to look at him only and teach when he was here.” Whoever has the focus, the Guru will look at only them and talk. They expressed their envy, saying, “You talk about him even after he has left. So many of us are here; you never talk about any of us.” \nThe Guru wanted to teach them a lesson. He wrote two letters and asked them to hand it over to Janaka in his kingdom. The students traveled to the city of Mithila with the intent of meeting him. There are some protocols to meet a king. They took them inside after fulfilling those. They went to Janaka and sat with him. They were his friends, right? They asked him, “[Disciples] It is said that you are a Karma Yogi whose jna:na (knowledge) has ripened. When you are ruling the kingdom, where do you find time to do sa:dhana?” \n[Janaka] “I don’t have time.” [Disciples] “When you are ruling the kingdom, how can you have jna:na nishtta (steadfastness in knowledge)?” Janaka didn’t say anything. He just smiled and kept quiet. [Janaka] “You came so far away and are tired. Take a shower and in the evening, have prasadam (food first offered to the Deity).” There were two disciples who came from Ya:jnavalkya to Janaka’s kingdom. He arranged a luxurious bathroom of marble with showers of gold. Everything in the shower was of gold. They enjoyed those. Next, he arranged prasadam for them. Those who were serving were very beautiful. The items were also very tasty. \nThe disciples sat and did a:posanam (sprinkling water around the plate before eating). They were about to eat. They were provided with a gold platform to sit on and were served on a gold plate; they didn’t know what to say. Everything was so wonderful. Looking around, they glanced up. There were swords dangling right on top of their heads. They showed the swords to each other. They were tied with very thin threads, and the swords were heavy. They were just 2 feet above their heads. If the threads had loosened by any chance, the tips of the swords would have fallen right on their heads. Since they had done a:posanam, they had to finish what was on the plate. They couldn’t move until they finished. Hence, they were eating, but their focus was on the swords. \nThey somehow finished what was on the plates and left the dining room. Later, the king arranged nice beds for them. Janaka came to talk with his friends then. [Janaka] “Friends, how are you?” [Disciples] “We are good.” [Janaka] “Did you eat?” [Disciples] “Yes, we ate.” [Janaka] “I got gulab jamun (an Indian dessert) made for you. Did you eat mysore paak, bandar laddu, khaaja (Indian sweets)?” They served all those, and the disciples ate them too. But they didn’t remember what they had eaten. [Janaka] “Friends, I got all those prepared for you. Didn’t you eat them?” [Disciples] “How could we eat? You got the swords placed above our heads. If they had loosened and fallen down, we would have lost our lives. We don’t know what they served; we somehow finished it and came out.” \n[Janaka] “Did you finish eating?” [Disciples] “We ate everything. We didn’t leave anything on the plates as that is the rule.” [Janaka] “Friends, just like you ate all the tasty items without focusing on the taste, while ruling I might have to punish someone or have to praise someone or benefit someone, but not caring about the benefits or punishments nor about the praises or criticisms, focusing only on a:thma (soul) as per acharya’s (teacher’s) instructions, I am living my life.” Both the disciples realized their mistake. Janaka never stopped his Karma Yoga. However, he never cared about the benefits or losses; hence, his mind never got disturbed, and his buddhi (intellect) became achala vyavasa:ya buddhi (firm and determined intellect). \nJanaka is one of the important ones among those who attained a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (self-realization) by practicing Karma Yoga. karmanaiva hi samsiddhim a:sthitha:ha janaka:daya:ha (Through actions alone, Janaka and others attained perfection). Sri Krishna says this in chapter 3. This is what we should attain. Arjuna, you should also work similarly. You should wage war just as Janaka ruled his kingdom. Those favorable to you might get hit by arrows. You can probably protect a few. Many things will happen. But your goal should be to fulfill your duty. Can you do that? \n[Arjuna] “Looks like my manas is not that mature yet.” [Sri Krishna] “What should we do now? You asked me to tell you about sthitha prajna (one with a fixed steady mind).” [Arjuna] “You told me, but it doesn't look like I have reached that stage also. Please tell me about the stage before that.” Sri Krishna felt he had to tell Arjuna because He owned him, so He started describing the stage prior to sthitha prajna in verse 2.58. Let’s try to learn about it in detail. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We can say the Bhagavad Gita is a wonderful psychological science. We can use it as a philosophical science. It is also useful to us as a psychological science. It clearly explains how we should behave in a particular situation. The second chapter especially is a summary of the rest of the chapters. If we understand the second chapter well, the rest of the Bhagavad Gita can be understood based on that. It says…\nTo attain anything in this world, one must have fixed clarity of goal and a focused mind. If one has to progress in studies, business, or a job, they need to have a focused mind. Whatever they want to attain, they should have it firmly set in their manas (mind). For it to stay firm in their mind, they should know how to face the hurdles that come in the way. In fact, there is no great necessity to attain anything worldly. If a person develops focus on a:thma (soul) and wants to attain a:thma, i.e., ‘see’ themselves, it is referred to as a:thma sa:ksha:thka:ra (realization of the soul) or a:thma:va:lo:kana (vision of the soul).\nIn such a case, what is the way to focus the mind? What means should be adopted? What are the obstacles in the way? How can they be modified to be in your favor? Sri Krishna is teaching the above to Arjuna. He termed the state of dedicated practice as sthitha prajnatha (steady wisdom). Every human being must attain this. The Lord explains the process of attaining it in four verses…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI bow repeatedly to Sri Rama, the remover of all obstacles and the giver of all wealth.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDescribing the first stage, He says whatever we are used to, our pravrutthis (instincts) will follow that. Just because we start something new today, our mind will not be focused on that immediately. Whatever we are used to and have practiced so far, our pravrutthis will follow that. What will pravrutthis follow? Instincts of body, mind, and thoughts resulting from the intellect. All of these will follow them [past habits]. This is what usually happens. Today we want to achieve something new. What should we do to achieve that?\nFirst, our buddhi (intellect) won’t listen to us. Even our manas (mind) will not cooperate. Our body also may not cooperate. If we want to do well in an exam, we feel sleepy as soon as we hold a book. Or we may be sitting but we can’t comprehend a single word. Or all the things we are familiar with in the past come into our mind. With that, even our body doesn’t cooperate with us. Let’s say someone is talking about God. As soon as we sit there, we start yawning. However, if we sit in a movie, we don’t yawn. Even if we are sleepy, we become alert. On the other hand, if we have to do anything related to God, we feel sleepy. Our body is fidgety and we can’t focus on what is there. This is not our fault. It is just that we are not used to it.\nHence, our instincts are according to whatever we are used to. This is what usually happens. However, once you fix a goal, you have to forcibly put your mind towards it. Since the body is essential, we have to first get the body used to working in a proper way. How do we control the body? First, whatever we thought was to be avoided, we shouldn’t allow it to go there. Let’s say someone is addicted to cigarettes. If they somehow get determined in their mind to stop smoking as it is interfering with their work… or because it is spoiling their health, even if they find it very difficult or feel like crying, they should get used to keeping it away from them.\nBy keeping it away, on the first day, their tongue cries for it. If they still persist, on the second day, it reduces a bit by 30 percent. On the third day, it reduces by 10 percent more. On the fourth day, it reduces 10 percent more. If they persist in keeping it away from them for 7, 10, 15, or 20 days, their attachment to it starts decreasing. They kept the object [cigarette] away from the body and indriya (sense organ). However, they are not sure if their indriya will listen to them or not. The body will be in control as the object is away. But manas and buddhi don’t have that control. Hence, we don’t know if they have turned their back on their previous habits or not, if they have changed or not. Because they are internal instruments, not external.\nFirst, they have to start their sa:dhana (dedicated practice) to make the external instruments work in a proper way. If they stop smoking for a month, they feel a kind of temporary detachment as the object is not there. They feel, “It’s not accessible, it’s okay, what can we do?” When the wind blows away what’s in the hand, it is thought of as an offering to God [because there is nothing they can do]. That is how they feel in the beginning. However, if they see the object, they would want to immediately take it. Like a dog’s tail which is tied to a stick. As long as it is tied to the stick, it appears straight. Once the stick is taken away, the tail comes back to its original position. Similarly, indriya:s too, once they see the object, they go back towards the object. For them not to go back, they have to continue their sa:dhana for a long time. Sri Krishna says this in a verse later…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyathathohyathi kaunthe:ya purushasya vipaschitthaha indriya:ni prama:dhi:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nO Kaunteya (son of Kunti), the senses are restless and trouble us greatly.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIndriya:s trouble us a lot asking us to procure objects. That is one stage. However, if one has fixed clarity of goal and decides to attain it, they have to keep the objects away forcibly if needed. If they do sa:dhana for some time, they might see some change in the external senses. However, what needs to be done for manas and buddhi? We kept the object away from the body, as the body is a visible instrument. However, manas is not a visible instrument. We can’t catch hold of buddhi either. What should we do about them?\nSri Krishna responded to this previously…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsruthi viprathipanna:the yada stha::syathi nischala\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen the mind is steady and focused on what it has heard, it becomes unwavering.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe have to listen. Whatever we listen to, we have to reflect on it. Whatever you want to attain, you have to repeatedly listen about it. It is one thing to keep the [distracting] external object away from the body. Educating manas and buddhi about the goal is a means to properly tune them [to attain the goal]. Hence, we have to listen. We must continue to listen. Here’s one thing to know about keeping objects physically distant from us. If we do not get knowledge about the desired right goal in a favorable way, keeping the objects away feels very difficult for us. We feel like crying and it is generally impossible for the manas to go towards the goal. Hence, one must be introduced again and again to the desired a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul). It could be about a:thma, God, or something else.\nWe keep hearing stories about the devotees of Pa:ndu Ranga. Two devotees came to the temple. One person left to give a:ra:thi (offering) to God out of devotion for God. Both of them came for God and they are good friends. After coming midway, because someone needed help, the other person said, ‘I will come after helping this person’. The first person went to the temple. However, since more help was needed, the other person had to stay back. Though he was rendering help, he was feeling bad that he couldn’t go to a:ra:thi and was remembering God. The one who went to the temple was seeing a:ra:thi, eating prasa:dam (blessed food), but he was worrying about the other person thinking how he was, what he must be doing, and why he hadn’t come.\nManas is very crucial. You must keep only the required matter in mind. But whether it will stay with that or go behind other things depends on the company you give it [manas]. In fact, controlling manas is very critical. We have to work for that. How far should it [practice] go? Once there was someone called [sage] Viswamitra who used to get angry very easily. However, because of his sa:dhana, even when encountered with situations demanding anger, he was able to stay calm. He performed penance for thousands of years. As part of concluding the penance, he was about to eat. Indra, king of heaven, disguised as a bramhin (Brahmin), set out to make Viswamitra angry and disrupt his penance. He asked Viswamitra for alms. Indra asked for food just before he was about to eat. Viswamitra saw through this. Though he knew it was Indra who had come to make him angry, he was able to control his manas without getting angry, with the sa:dhana he did. He gave away the food to Indra. He told him, ‘I know you are Indra. Take this food,’ and was able to leave without getting angry.\nIt takes a long time of dedicated practice to get manas in control. It takes a long time of dedicated practice to get each, the body, manas (mind), and buddhi (intellect) in control. The second chapter of Bhagavad Gita clarifies that sa:dhana is very important. Let’s learn about it gradually and go forward. Jai Srimannarayana!\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), The second chapter of Bhagavad Gita tells us about concentration. There are three things that interfere with focus. One is indriyas (senses), along with the body. If we want to focus on something, as they are not used to it, they go towards what they are familiar with. Thereby we can’t achieve what we desire; we land up somewhere else. \nLet’s say we somehow work hard and pull them back on track. There is a leader to the senses called manas (mind). It has many samskaras (habits) from the past. Even though you set a new goal today, it keeps thinking about whatever it is used to from the past instead of how to attain the goal. Some people come to us for advice. They ask why something can’t be done in a particular way. When we start telling them why it can’t be done, they proceed to tell why we should do it that way. Because they are used to that, they won’t listen to what we say and continue to express what they like. They try to convince us with what they prefer. They didn’t come to us for our advice; rather, they came to convince us with what they like. This is the general characteristic of our manas.\nThe second important thing is to control such manas. The third one is the buddhi (intellect), which gives thoughts in the right way. Manas, that which thinks, needs to be furnished with the right content. This is what buddhi does. In fact, even when you want to do something good or bad, it can provide logic to support both. If the mind is focused and in a stable state, it is easy to control the other two [intellect and senses]. Hence, manas is very critical. It is said,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmana e:va manushya:na:m ka:ranam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nmanas is the cause for everything\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe might have heard of Rama Chandra. When Rama turned 25, his father promised him the kingdom. He was asked to perform the rites prior to coronation, which he did. In the eastern part of Dasaratha’s mansion, they arranged many kalasas (pots with sanctified water) for his coronation ceremony. They sent a message to Rama to come early in the morning. Rama came, saw the kalasas, and went inside. While going, he looked at them happily, thinking all these kalasas were arranged for him. However, once he went inside, the situation changed, and he was instructed to go to the forests instead of ruling the kingdom. Common people would get angry and confront them; however, Rama didn’t do that. His stepmother informed him, ‘It is your father’s intention that you go to the forest. He is hesitating to tell you. Hence, I am conveying it on his behalf.’ Rama accepted happily. \nHe was coming outside. First, he convinced his manas to go to the forest. After his manas accepted it, he verbally expressed his consent. Mother Sita tells this to Hanuman in Sundarakanda while explaining to him about what happened before she came here [to Lanka]. After his stepmother conveyed it to him, Rama first realized and comprehended it with his manas, accepted it, and then responded to her through words. He accepted with his manas first. If we have to do something forcibly, we do it sadly. Our manas doesn’t accept it and continues to cry. However, it wasn’t like that for Rama. He accepted it with manas first. Later, va:cha prathigruhi:thava:n, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nva:cha prathigruhi:thava:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe responded verbally\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe said, ‘It is fine whether you or father says it. It is the same thing. I will definitely go,’ and came out. There will be some sorrow in manas, right? He saw the kalasas as soon as he came out. They were meant for him. But now, they will use it for Bharata. Ordinary people would get upset and feel like kicking those kalasas. However, Rama didn’t feel that way. Why? His manas already accepted going to the forest as soon as he was told. Once the manas accepted it, his indriyas didn’t oppose it. He saw the kalasas and paid obeisances to them. Why? Because he felt that these kalasas contain the sanctified water to use for [the coronation of] the future king. His manas accepted this. If he thought they [kalasas] were for him, maybe he would have felt sad. He thought they are worthy for the future king and hence are worshipable. He circumambulated them, paid obeisances to them, and went on his way to wherever he was supposed to go.\nUnless you do sadhana (dedicated practice), this great qualification can’t be achieved by common people. However, Rama is an ideal human being. As he has attained the qualified state, he attained that state naturally. Since manas is not a visible instrument, we don’t know how and what it is doing. When it comes to indriyas, to avoid seeing, we can close our eyes. To avoid listening, we can put some cotton in our ears or do something. We can tie our hands or legs if we don’t want them to function. What can we do for manas? How can we control manas? How will it listen to us? This is an uncomfortable situation. It is not easy to make manas listen to us. \nWe can’t keep manas idle. We must give it some work. It is an instrument designed to work. To move about is the natural characteristic of air. If we stop the flow, it can take lives. To flow is the natural characteristic of water. If it keeps flowing, it is fresh; otherwise, it gets stagnant and dirty. Manas is an instrument that keeps working constantly. It is a very powerful instrument. We can’t see manas or hold it. Hence, it shouldn’t be kept idle. It should be given some work; otherwise, it will destroy you. Previously we spoke about the story of Guruji's rakshasi (malignant demon). Our manas is like that. We shouldn’t keep it idle. It is our responsibility to teach it how and where it should act. \nWhen there is a huge flood, if we leave the water, it merges with the ocean. However, if we contain the water by building a dam or something, we can use it for many good purposes. Manas is also like that. It needs to be contained and sent in some direction. It shouldn’t be kept idle. There are a few people who disturb everyone around if they are not given a position. For them not to disturb everyone, they need to be given some position or the other. Manas is more dangerous than them. Where should we direct it? Whatever is our goal, we should direct it towards that. We shouldn’t keep it idle. We should teach it where it should flow or act. If it doesn’t flow like that, it will behave like unrestrained water drowning everything around. We have to remember this.\nManas should be familiar with whatever we are trying to show it. This is another problem. Little kids don’t go to strangers even if they offer them chocolates or other things. They take the chocolate but don’t go to them. They want to be with their mom or dad, whoever they are familiar with. They want to stay with them even if they hit them. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nusha nirastho:pi sishu sthanandayaha na ja:thu ma:thus charanau jiha:sathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nLittle kids, even if the parents hit them, want to stay with them, instead of going to a teacher or other strangers\n-----------------------------------------------\nSimilarly, our manas also wants to be with familiar things; it doesn’t desire to see atma (soul) or paramaatma (Supreme Soul), which it is not familiar with. Initially, when we put the kids in school, they don’t like to stay there. However, if we get them used to it and get them interested by saying that they can play with others, later they wouldn’t want to stay home and would only want to go to school. Developing the habit!\nThere is a place called Sri Rangam. There was a great person called Nambillai there. Usually, if you want to turn manas towards God, you should develop interest in divine sayings about God. He used to sit near a pushkarini (lake) near the Srirangam temple and give discourses about Bhagavad Vishayam (the subject of God). A lot of people used to sit there and enjoy the discourse. They all developed keen interest by listening to it constantly. Nambillai used to preach only about the greatness of Sri Ranga. In the afternoon, they would take Selvar, a deity of Rangaatha, and put bali harana (sanctified food) around the temple. At the time of bali harana, there used to be the sound of temple bells and other instruments. Everyone was required to stand. They were not allowed to continue their discussion and were required to stand at that time. The timing of bali harana was also around the same time as the discourse. Nambillai had to stop his discourse for some time, and they had to stand during bali harana. Unable to tolerate the break in the discourse because of bali harana, they used to ‘criticize’ Lord Ranganatha, saying, ‘the enemy to our discourse is coming.’ Who are they ‘criticizing’? Ranganatha! Who were they listening about? About Ranganatha himself! \nMore than the Lord, they were more focused on the person describing the Lord’s glories, as he introduced them to the subject and was able to convince them about it. There is enough subject matter about the Lord’s greatness. However, it should be told in a way that everyone likes it. You have to make their manas accept it. If manas likes it once, it will gradually act on it by taking indriyas and buddhi along with it. Manas will be able to mold buddhi to think accordingly. Hence, reforming our manas is a very important process. \nIn the second chapter, while instructing us about how to control the mind, the Lord discusses sthitha prajnatha (stable knowledge). Prajna is knowledge that is stable in the mind. It should be taken to a level where it is unwavering despite any attempts to distract. Discussing that and how to overcome the obstacles in the way, the Lord proceeds further. Let’s try to learn that. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), in chapter 2 of Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna explained the means to control manas (mind). We are in the process of discussing it. Elders advise dhyana (meditation) or pranayama (breathing exercises) to control manas. This is to make the instrument [manas] efficient. Once the instrument [manas] is efficient, we should feed it good thoughts. Give the mind topics you desire related to thathva (eternal realities) in a way that it likes.\nManas is like a little child. If we ask little children to see or think about a particular thing, they don’t like it and want to look at what they like. Previously, elders used to make little children aware of what needs to be known. They used to teach them somehow, either using fear, by coaxing, or convincing them. Now the situation has changed. If the kids cry or don’t listen to us, we don’t have the patience or the time to convince them. So parents give them a cell phone with a few games in it, to a child less than a year old. When the child starts playing with it, parents are relieved and get back to their tasks.\nWhatever you get someone used to, he becomes proficient in that. We all know this. We give them unnecessary things and try to justify it. How? We say, ‘technology is developing, the world is moving towards the 22nd century.’ ‘It is our responsibility to expose our children to that. We must get them used to cell phones.’ What does the child do in the future? Even if he has an exam, he sits in a corner with a cell phone and does not listen to anyone. Finally, he gets into various addictions, and a situation arises where we can’t connect with him. We are seeing a lot of such kids. We are the ones who got him used to that.\nIf the parents are used to drinking coffee or tea, they get the kids used to it. Gradually, after he grows up, he may develop other addictions like drinking and gambling. Once it goes to that extent, we feel, ‘The child is not listening to us. He’s become like this.’ However, we did not get the child used to good habits, right? Our manas is also like that. We should gradually convince our manas, using ways it likes, to kindle interest in good topics.\nHowever, there is a problem here. We know manas is not a visible instrument. How can we convince it and make it listen to us? Give it to someone who can mold it to listen? Nowadays, our people are training animals to do many tasks. Dogs, cats, and other animals do many things. In the circus, artists perform many acts, right? How are they able to make them do those things? They didn’t get there in a day. They use many means and make animals practice in many ways so they can do those things. It [animal] doesn’t do it with its intellect. It does it mechanically because of the practice it was made to go through.\nIn whose hands should we put our manas that way? Even if we put it in someone's hands, how can we be sure of what will happen to it later? Arjuna got this doubt as to who is the grand master who can train the mind? How should we pay him? After all that, we can’t be sure if the mind will listen to us or not. Sri Krishna clarified his doubt in verse 2.61. He said, ‘don’t put your manas in anyone’s hands.’\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntha:ni sarva:ni samyamya yuktha a:si:tha mathparaha\nvase:hi yasya indriya:ni thasya prajna: prathishtitha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nControl all the senses, and be focused on Me. The one who has control over his senses has stable knowledge.\n-----------------------------------------------\nFor knowledge to be stable in you, the distracting indriyas (senses) have to be controlled. If the senses are in control, there is nothing else which you won’t be able to achieve. If they are not in control, whatever you do will be of no use. You can’t control your mind and senses. Instead of trying to control them, direct their actions towards Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntha:ni sarva:ni samyamya  \nyuktha a:si:tha mathparaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nControl the tendencies of all the senses and direct them towards Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat happens then? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvase:hi yasya indriya:ni\nthasya prajna prathishtitha:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThen all senses will be in one’s control, and only such a person whose senses are in his control will have a focused mind.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe Lord said, ‘turn them towards Me’. In Srimad Bhagavatam, Kapila gives a wonderful upadesa (teaching) to his mother Devahuthi. While discussing how to control manas, he said, ‘we should give something beautiful to manas.’ What does manas get attracted to? Where there is beauty, manas gets attracted to that. Whatever is easily accessible, manas gets attracted to that. Whatever is great, the mind gets attracted to that. So it should have greatness, be accessible, beautiful, and it has to give us happiness. If all these are not there, the mind doesn’t go there. The thathva (truth) who has all these is God. Hence, you have to take your mind towards God.\nKapila revealed a great sadhana (dedicated practice) to Devahuthi on taking the mind towards God. What is the first step?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsan chinthaye:th bhagavathas charana:ravindam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nMeditate on the lotus feet of the Lord.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHave darshan (vision), see the Lord starting from His feet. Then come up gradually to His knees, His thighs, His waist, His chest, His shoulders, His throat, His hands, His fingers, His cheeks, His nose, His hair, and His crown.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npa:da:di ke:sa:ntha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBeginning at His feet upwards to His hair.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWatch them and reflect on their expression of grace on us. Now, begin at His hair and go downwards to His feet. And then from feet back to the hair again. Manas is used to movement. If you try to tie it in one place, it won’t stay there. It gets suffocated when tied down and falters at some point. Don’t tie it in one place; let it move. But not the way it wants, make it move the way you want. Since it is used to movement, you are moving it. Since you want God, you are making it move around God. Hence, it is a wonderful instrument that helps in focusing on God. From His feet to His hair.\nCan we ever see God? Yes, He is visible. How and where? We see Him in a temple or mandir (place of worship), at home. He is visible as archa murthi (deity) in these places. God is adorned in many ways with beautiful clothes, ornaments, and weapons on Him. Why is He adorned this way? Does He need clothes, ornaments, or weapons? He doesn’t need any of these. Then why is He adorned this way? It is not for Him; it is for you.\nThere is a sthotra (praise), extolled by the celestial beings of Swetha Dweepa, an island in the Milky Ocean where the Lord reclines.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna the: ru:pam na cha:ka:ra:ha na:yu:dha:ni na cha:spadam\nthada:pi purusha:ka:raha bhaktha:na:m thwam prakashase:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWeapons, form, name, decorations, and place are not for Him. They are for us.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWeapons, form, name, decorations, and place are not for Him. They are for us. We need to have a focused mind, so He adorns beautiful ornaments. Why? We love weapons, beauty, decorations, clothes, and food items. Whatever your mind gets attracted to and wherever it goes, whatever is most beautiful among them, collect all the best of those things mentally and apply them to God. It is fine if you can’t do it physically. The mind doesn’t have that limitation, right? Collect them with your mind and apply them to God.\nYou may have seen beautiful feet somewhere. See them as God’s feet. You may have seen an amazingly beautiful waist. Recall it and see it as God’s waist. You may have seen a broad chest. Apply it for God. You may have seen the most beautiful eyes. Apply them for God. You may have seen beautiful hair somewhere. Apply it for God. If what we arranged is so beautiful and attractive every second, how fathomless must be His divine beauty, the origin of all those? If it [His beauty] were a vast ocean, whatever is imaginable by all of our buddhi (intellect) is only a droplet in it. Now, feel it; try to visualize it. This is called pa:da:di ke:sha:ntha sthuthi (praise from feet to hair).\nAn Alwar named Thiruppan Alwar sang about Lord Rangana:tha like that, saying amalan a:dipira:n. Kapila gives a wonderful upadesa to his mother Devahuthi about the Lord's beauty.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuktha a:si:tha math paraha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nApply them for Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThen He controls your manas from distractions. He makes sure your sadhana (practice) stays throughout. The main means to control manas is to see God in your manas and direct your manas towards God. This strong foundation establishes prajna (beneficial knowledge) in us. Let us try to gradually learn about that. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), today we will explore the profound teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, particularly focusing on the importance of meditation and identifying the root causes of our distractions.\nWhat should you reflect on? Whatever is the root cause, reflect on it. This is a beautiful saying. Just like a doctor identifies the root cause of a patient's illness to prescribe the right treatment, we too must identify the root cause of our troubles. For a seeker (sa:dhaka), we need to pinpoint what distracts them from their practice and provide solutions that help them stay focused.\nChapter 2 of the Bhagavad Gita discusses how to remove the hurdles in our journey towards God or self-realization. It raises important questions: Whom should we meditate upon? How do we discipline our senses and mind (manas)? Who will support us in this endeavor? Sri Krishna provides an answer in verse 2.61.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntha:ni sarva:ni samyamya yukthaha a:si:tha mathparaha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFocus your mind on Me. Perform all your activities as service to Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKrishna emphasizes that only then will our senses and mind be under control, as He is an auspicious support (subha:srayam). The question of whom to meditate upon during worship (upa:sana) is significant. The seers have beautifully explained that everything in this world is filled with three types of emotional states (bha:vana): karma bha:vana, bramha bha:vana, and ubhaya bha:vana.\nEvery object in this universe embodies one of these states, from the smallest insect to the four-headed creator, Brahma. Some are driven by karma bha:vana, while others are immersed in bramha bha:vana, and some possess both. \nKarma bha:vana means acting according to our past actions (karma). We often find ourselves doing things not entirely of our own choosing, as if pushed by an unseen force. Arjuna questions this in Chapter 3:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nattha ke:na prayuktho::yam pa:pam charathi pu:rushaha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhat is this Krishna? I don’t intend to do anything bad, but some tasks just get accomplished by me as if someone is pushing me from behind.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKrishna answers this later, but the key point is that we are all influenced by karma. Therefore, meditating on those driven by karma is not beneficial, as we become like what we meditate upon.\nThe second state, bramha bha:vana, is represented by great seers like Sanaka and Sanandhana, who are always focused on God. While we can meditate on them, we may not aspire to renounce the world entirely. We desire to live happily, eat, and experience life while staying true to our goals.\nThus, we need to find something beyond these emotional states to meditate upon. The only entity that transcends these bha:vana is Narayana. Krishna states in Chapter 2:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuktha a:si:tha mathparaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFocus on Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe assures us that He is not affected by these emotional states, encouraging us to engage our minds with Him. When we do this, our senses and intellect will also be under control. Krishna promises that He will guide us positively.\nHe uses the analogy of fire to illustrate this point. Just as a small fire can ignite a large area of dry wood, meditating on God can burn away the accumulated sins from our past lives:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nharir harathi pa:pa:ni dushta chiththairapi smruthaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf you place the name Hari in your mind, the sins collected over many lifetimes will be burnt to ashes.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen we hold Vishnu in our hearts, He cleanses us of our bad karma. The Bhagavad Gita teaches that when we place Vishnu within us, He helps us overcome distractions and align our senses and mind towards our goals.\nWe should strive to establish Lord Vishnu firmly in our thoughts, just as great souls like Go:da Devi’s father, Vishnu Chitthulu, did. By doing so, we can nurture our spiritual growth and become worthy of worship ourselves.\nLet us take Krishna's teachings to heart and make Him our sole focus in meditation. This is the beautiful and powerful means He has provided us. Let us try and see.\nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Generally, humans tend to feel… ‘I know everything. I don’t need anything from others.’ ‘Why should I listen to others? I can achieve everything on my own!’ ‘One can achieve anything with self-effort!’ We usually see such overconfidence from those who believe in their own ability and effort alone. It is not wrong to trust your own ability. It is needed actually! In fact, it’s the self-effort that’s behind any success. However, if one can remember that the basis for self-effort is God, then it progresses well. Otherwise, it is unclear where our efforts lead to!\nWhy? God (Sri Krishna) in Chapter 2.61 says -\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuktha a:si:tha mathparaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nexecute your activities while staying focused on Me\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhen we release a bird freely into the sky, we cannot predict which way the bird will fly. However, if we tie a string to its leg, hold the other end of the string, and release the bird, then irrespective of where the bird goes and how long it flies, we can draw it in anytime and keep it steady. If we release a flying kite without support, we cannot predict where it will end up, where it might get stuck, or get torn flying into a tree. If we were to hold its line and fly it, then we can enable it to showcase its beauty while flying high. We will be able to reel it in and set it aside anytime. This can be achieved via a capable person’s hands. \nWe know how the kite cannot be controlled if released without any support. Faculties such as senses, mind, and intelligence are similar. If someone thinks, ‘I will try to control these on my own. I will make it happen,’ then maybe some are able to do it without trusting in God’s support. We don’t know, but it is not advisable. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmath paraha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nfocus [them] on Me\n-----------------------------------------------\nThey can be easily controlled only when one tries to control them while staying focused on God. Why? Because they are operated by Him. Nature follows His instruction, so does the indwelling soul. Are we able to inhale the air as and when we choose to? [Some might say] ‘Yes, I do it on my own.’ Maybe that’s why during the Coronavirus pandemic, many scrambled for pure air in the hospital! ‘I need air! My oxygen levels are down to 80, 85, 60, 70. Need to use the cylinder. Connect it. Breathe in the air, increase the levels 90, 96!’ If we were in control, why did the people struggle for air then? Is your body under your control? Will the body listen to you? How about the mind? Is the life energy in your control at least? If so, why did thousands of people die? Why is everyone scared for their life lately? Why is everyone conscious of their health in recent times? If they were to listen to us… None of them follow our intent. \nWhen we operate within limits, they appear to be in our control temporarily. We then misconstrue that we control them. That is incorrect. In reality, we do not. Some might say, ‘Human effort must also be there.’ ‘We should do our part and we also need His grace.’ Even Lakshmana (in Ramayana) said the same to Rama. When it was time to go to the forest, Lakshmana did not dare to say anything at the outset. After speaking to Kaikeyi, Ramachandra went to bid goodbye to His mother Kausalya. He told His mother, ‘Mother, this is not the time to rule the kingdom; instead, it is the time to move to the forest.’ She then cried and felt sad. She sobbed and said, ‘Why did this happen… Rama?’\nLakshmana Swamy felt a gust of energy then. He immediately became aggressive. ‘Mother, why do you speak of unnecessary things? That old man who is beyond his prime said something. One who is senile does not have a fully functioning brain. He listened to things from people here and there. He decreed an order that is neither beneficial to him nor to the kingdom or to anyone. It is incorrect, and I will stop it. You [Rama] ascend the throne! What do you think? What are my arms and muscles built for? They’re for You! Why do I wield this sword? It is to protect You! Every inch of me is being taken care of only to support You. There is no one who can oppose me! You take the throne.’\nRama, hearing this, smiled and said, ‘Glad to hear you say this. We plan for certain things while other things happen unexpectedly. Those that occur unexpectedly are God.’ Lakshmana retorted, ‘No way! Ignore God or anyone else. Only wimps talk about God or other factors. Those that lack in strength or skill take God’s excuse and blame Him when things don’t go their way. I do not believe in such things unnecessarily.’ \nSo what will you do? ‘I trust in my self-effort. I will show my prowess,’ said Lakshmana. He said, ‘With my power, I will take on God. I will override it.’ Rama was surprised. He said, ‘O! fool. What you imagine to be your own strength is endowed by and also its success is ensured by God Himself.’ Therefore, thinking that half effort is by yourself and half is by God, or… ‘We should do our part; only then God will support it!’… ‘O fool! These are meaningless conjectures.’ \nImagine a moving car; who is the reason behind its movement? If someone says, ‘Fuel must work a bit and we have to do our part as well’… Can you drive it if the fuel tank is empty and you sit in the car, change the gears back and forth, try to accelerate it by moving the steering wheel? Will it move? Dwelling in you, God alone provides strength from within. God inspires thoughts. God alone drives your senses. The strength to carry an activity is also from Him. When everything is from Him, where is the question of partial effort from you? Where is that coming from? That does not exist. God empowers you to do everything. \nRama convinced Lakshmana that day. Some people tend to say, ‘It’s our effort. With it, we can achieve anything.’ In reality, God is the cause behind our effort. If we ignore Him, what happens to your effort? If He says, ‘Son, I will stop supporting you for a bit and see how your effort progresses’ and moves away… [During COVID-19] the doctors and the hospital fully packed the infected and deceased, including their face, without any loophole, asking their relatives to pay respects from afar and take the deceased away from the other side. When does this happen? When indwelling God says, ‘You do your own effort. I will step away for a bit.’ He is the one who is making all things happen from within. \nOne must recognize this. Put your trust in Him. If you trust in yourselves, the senses, mind, and intelligence inside can lead us astray in an unpredictable way. We end up becoming servants to them. They will drag us into a downward spiral. We should trust Him; He is an able charioteer. He will therefore ensure that this chariot (body) stays fit. He will guide us on the right path and will lead us towards victory. Therefore, we must rely on Him. This is what Sri Krishna mentioned in Chapter 2 of Bhagavad Gita.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntha:ni sarva:ni samyamya\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOnly the one who can focus his mind on Him …\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvase:hi yasye:ndriya:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\n…only those who can do that will attain proper knowledge.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nprajna: prathishttitha: bhavathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOthers will be devoid of that proper knowledge.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHow should one do it? Will He stop the functioning of senses? Or will He stop internal functions? He will not do any of it. He will try to transform whatever you are used to doing. How? If you are used to eating, He will not ask you to stop eating. Earlier, you would think, ‘I am eating; it’s for my sake. It’s for my taste.’ These thoughts are what He will transform. To a mind, thoughts are important. So He will try to transform these. \nWhen you changed from mathparaha (focused on yourself) to, like He said, tathparaha (focused on Him), then whatever you prepared was offered to Him. Once it is offered to Him, the name it is known by changes. Now it became something that He gave to you. It is now prasadam (blessed food) from Him. It is now His grace. Now you are taking that. Since you are used to eating, you are taking it in. But you are taking that which will not worsen your ego, pride, or arrogance. Instead, you are augmenting the food intake by treating it as prasadam. It’s given by Him.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthe:na thyakte:na bhunji:tha: ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nYou should eat. But know how much, what, and how to consume it.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nIsa:va:sya Upanishad\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTreat it as something He bestowed and allocated for you.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou then enjoy it to your content. Now nothing bad can happen to you. You are getting the food you are used to along with the beneficial pure ingredient. Then, the ‘dirt’ within will slowly be cleansed. To remove filth blocking the drainage, one must mix a cleansing material with water to burn and flush it out. It flows inside, removes blockages, melts and clears the debris, and makes it flow out. It will then clear the opening. \nSimilarly, if we can ingest whatever we consume as Bhagavath prasadam (blessed food), then eventually it will remove past imprints, cleanse them, and make sure there is no further accumulation of ‘dirt’. Then the mind, senses, and intellect will obey you.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvase:hi yasya indriya:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSome might say, ‘What you said is fine, but I will do what I feel like. I will do what pleases me. I will act according to my wishes. I will achieve what I need to.’\n-----------------------------------------------\nIn the 2nd chapter, Arjuna asked Lord Krishna, ‘If I act without any focus on you, what will happen? If I want to achieve things with my own effort, what will happen?’ To that question, Lord responded with a beautiful answer in three slokas (verses). He presented them in an order. Just like there is an order to elevate oneself, an order exists for decline too. To elevate and grow is a slow and incremental process. While the decline happens with just one act. \nTo move a rock up the mountain, it needs to be pushed slowly all the way to the top. It’s very hard. But if we take away our hand’s support, it barely takes half a minute to roll down. It will crush anything that’s in the middle of its path. Even if you are in its path, it will crush you on its way down. We should know that order of decline. Only if we know it, we will be able to observe that order. That is why starting from verse 2.62, Sri Krishna explains the order of decline. We will learn more about it further. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2… Today, we are discussing an important question: ‘Are our efforts enough or do we need help from others in controlling our mind?’ We are exploring how the Lord instructed us about this in the second chapter. Our efforts are commendable, but it is always beneficial to depend on the Lord who can make those efforts successful.\nIn verse 2.61, the Lord says:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuktha a:si:tha mathparaha |\nvase:hi yasye:ndriya:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf you stabilize your mind (manas) on Me, I will ensure your senses (indriya), mind, and intellect (buddhi) are controlled.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe Lord has promised us this. If you focus on God, that is good. However, if people think they can do it by themselves with their efforts, what will happen?\n[Arjuna] Sri Krishna, if You are not with me, is there any loss?\n[Sri Krishna] What can I say? Learn about how they will behave without My grace.\nSri Krishna is instructing us on how our senses, mind, and intellect will behave if they do not have His support. Primarily, what does the mind (manas) do? It thinks about unnecessary topics. We may feel that we can control what it thinks about. Why not?\nIf I don’t want to see something, am I not closing my eyes or turning my head away? If I don’t want to eat something, am I not closing my mouth? If I don’t want to listen to something, am I not closing my ears? It is true that you can close your eyes, ears, and mouth when you want to. However, how can you close or stop your mind?\nIn fact, there is no instrument to close your ears either. When you want to do puja (worship) or meditate, someone might start making noise. Will you be able to avoid listening to it? Even in the case of some senses, we are unable to control them fully; forget about the mind. The mind is an internal instrument.\nWhen you sit down to meditate after closing the doors and lighting the lamp or incense stick, the mind gets an opportunity to wander to the marketplace you visited the previous evening and starts thinking about what you refused to buy, wondering if it was the right idea. The mind ‘wandered’ there and started to think, ‘We should have bought it yesterday; today its price has also gone up.’\nWhat is the mind doing? Though you are sitting here, it doesn’t need anyone’s permission to go anywhere, and it has the capacity to go anywhere in a second. It goes to the place where you do not want it to go. Whatever you didn’t want to eat, the mind starts thinking about it. Whatever you didn’t want to see, it starts seeing that. Whatever you didn’t want to do, it starts doing that. It is not in our control. The mind is the leader of the senses.\nSometimes in our dreams, the mind goes to places we do not imagine and roams there. It feels as if we are really there, eating, seeing, and doing everything. Whatever we don’t want, it starts meditating on that. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndhya:yatho: vishaya:n pumsa:ha sangaha theshu upaja:yathe\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAs one thinks of objects, attachment arises.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou are a good person and sat in puja for an hour. However, your mind was wandering somewhere for 59.5 minutes. Only when you were thinking of sitting and getting up was it in your control. All other times, it was roaming elsewhere. You cannot control it. Try it once when you are doing puja. If you think, ‘I don’t want to think of a tiger at all,’ during puja, only that comes into your thoughts. Tigers from India or Africa or other places appear in your thoughts with their mouths open.\nWhatever you don’t want, the mind goes towards exactly that. It is not in our control. Once it goes there, it starts thinking many thoughts about it. Similar to how a virus spreads, thoughts also keep spreading like that. If it is something that the mind likes, it keeps bothering you until you acquire it. That is called attachment (sangaha) or connection (sambandham). With attachment, you get desire. If the desire is not satisfied, you get angry.\nThe Wise have told us that this attachment is very dangerous.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsangaha sarva:thmana: he:yaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAttachment is very bad in every way; leave it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nsache:tha:thum na sakyathe:\nIt’s not easy to leave it [attachment]. If you can’t leave it, then do attachment. But you are asking us to leave it. No, that’s fine. Do attachment, do more of it. How to do it?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsadbhissangha sada: ka:rya:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nDevelop attachment with good people and knowledgeable ones.\n-----------------------------------------------\nDesire to be in close proximity with them. What happens then? As the mind desires attachment, you are giving that. Since it should not degrade you, you are giving it good attachment.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsadbhissangha sada: ka:rya:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nDevelop attachment with good people.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsadbhissango:hi bheshajam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThat will become a good medicine.\n-----------------------------------------------\nLet’s suppose someone is used to drinking a lot of milk. He got sick because of that and went to a doctor. Let’s say the doctor mixed medicine in that milk and gave it to him. How happy will he be if he gets to drink milk which he likes so much? His sickness gets treated with the medicine, and he could have what he liked. That took care of both.\nSimilarly, the mind will make you do attachment with physical objects by turning you to that side. What should you do for that?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsadbhissangha sada: ka:rya:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nMake friendships with good people.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat will that do?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsadbhissango:hi bhe:shajam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt cuts down various faults in our thought patterns; removes them and purifies us.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHence, the Wise advise us to do that. Sri Krishna says, ‘If you want to do it yourself without depending on Me, there will be all kinds of dangers. Observe carefully.’\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsanga:th sanja:yathe: ka:ma:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOnce attachment happens, desire develops.\n-----------------------------------------------\nYou should have the desire for good things. Desire is not bad. Not having a desire for what’s worthy, that is bad. Why will desire itself be bad? To study well and get good marks. Can we say such a desire is bad? No! It is a good desire. However, if you say, ‘I will not study or touch books. I will only play games and watch T.V.’ and ‘However, in exams, I should get 99.99%.’ This is bad.\nDesire is not bad. Not having it in the right way is bad.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsanga:th sanja:yathe: ka:ma:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWe are naturally inclined to desire; when we go behind them and they are not fulfilled…\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nka:ma:th kro:dha:th abhija:yathe:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWe feel someone stopped our desire from being fulfilled.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe feel it happened because of someone. We feel like harming them. Whatever emotion we feel for the person who came between us and our desire is called anger (kro:dham). It doesn’t stop there. If it increases more, we feel like hurting that person.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkro:da:th bhavathi sammo:haha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen anger increases, confusion (sammo:ham) happens.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is confusion? You lose the ability to judge between right and wrong. Rama Chandra, while leaving to catch the deer, told Lakshmana, ‘Be careful. Recently we had a big dispute. That demoness (ra:ksha:si) came. Later other demons (ra:kshasa:s) came. This whole place seems to be filled with demons. We have to be careful. Now we have this magical deer. I will go as Sita desires it. However, we can’t trust anything here; we have to be careful. Take care of Sita. I will come back soon. If I can get it live, I will get it; otherwise, as Sita asked, I will get its skin.’\nRama went and tried to capture it. As he couldn’t do it, he thought of killing it. When he killed it, he realized it was a demon in disguise. He regretted following the deer. He got more concerned as the demon called out for Sita and Lakshmana before dying. Unsure of what would happen, Rama started running back swiftly. On the way back, he saw Lakshmana coming from the other side. He enquired what had happened.\n[Lakshmana] Sita scolded me and said, ‘Rama is in trouble; that’s why he called out for us. Go and check.’\n[Rama] Don’t you know me? Why did you come?\n[Lakshmana] Sita might have got upset with me otherwise.\n[Rama] So what if she got upset?\n[Lakshmana] She scolded me.\n[Rama] She might have scolded you. That’s fine. When someone is sad, they may not even know what they are saying. Did you get worked up just for that? You left Sita alone for that. Is it right to come like this? Is that what I told you to do? Why did you come to me? You said…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\naham sarva:m karishya:mi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI will do whatever you ask me to do.\n-----------------------------------------------\nI asked you to guard Sita. You left her and came.\n[Lakshmana] It is true I said that. I accompanied you [to the forest] with the same intention. However, if she scolds me, what should I do? I got angry.\n[Rama] Are you doing what anger is asking you to do or what I asked you to do? Are you Rama’s servant (Ra:ma Da:sa) or a servant of anger (kro:dha da:sa)?\nThey went back and looked. Whatever they feared had happened. They couldn’t find Sita. We call this as prana:sam (disappearance). Whoever they primarily wanted to protect has disappeared. That situation has come about. Similarly, anger makes us unable to judge between right or wrong, makes us forget how to behave by disabling our intellect, and landing us somewhere else rather than at our goal.\nIf you depend on your senses, there are many chances of something like this happening. Hence, don’t put the responsibility on yourself.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuktha a:si:tha math paraha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nPut the responsibility on Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nI will take care of ensuring things go smoothly. Saying so, the Lord proceeds in chapter 2, clarifying that He is the one who protects everyone from degradation and uplifts them. \nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), today we will explore the concepts of desire and anger. Are they good or bad? Should we have desires or get angry? Generally, people say that desires are not good and that we should not get angry. However, these views are not entirely correct.\nValmiki Bhagavan, while describing Rama, did not say that he lacked anger; instead, he mentioned that Rama had control over his anger. He referred to Rama as jitha krodhaha (one who has conquered anger). Valmiki also posed an interesting question: \"Tell me about the person who can scare even the gods when he is angry.\" In response, Narada said, \"Rama is the one who has his anger under control.\"\nThere is a significant difference between being controlled by anger and having anger in control. When we are controlled by anger, we often act without thinking, leading to regret after scolding or hurting others. This is the state of someone who is dominated by anger. In contrast, a person who controls their anger expresses it appropriately, using it to correct others when necessary.\nValmiki, while speaking about Rama, states, \"krodham a:ha:rayath thi:vram\" (Rama called forth intense anger). Rama desired concentrated anger for the right purpose. He seemed to have various intensities of anger stored, similar to how we have different concentrations of milk.\nFor instance, when Hanuman was fighting Ravana, he was injured, and Rama felt no sorrow for himself. However, he could not bear to see Hanuman in pain. \"krodham thi:vram a:ha:rayath\" (Rama called for highly concentrated anger) and donned it like a costume, becoming truly angry.\nIn English movies, when a character wears a costume, they gain extraordinary powers. Similarly, Rama used anger as a tool to achieve his goals. He directed his anger towards Ravana, rendering him helpless and sending him away. After the task was done, Rama dismissed his anger, just as one would remove a shirt.\nSo, is anger good or bad? We should have it, but it must be controlled. If a person has no anger at all, they may as well be dead. For example, if a child misbehaves and brings home something undesirable, we might be tempted to pamper them instead of getting angry. However, if we want to correct their behavior, we may need to temporarily express anger to guide them.\nParents sometimes scold their children not out of vengeance but out of a strong desire for their children's betterment. In this case, anger is good. It is beneficial when it is used to reform someone. \nSimilarly, is desire good or bad? Desire itself is not bad; it depends on what we desire. We should have good desires—desires for growth, wealth, happiness, and experiences that lead us and others toward the right path. A narrow desire, such as wanting to hoard food for oneself, is bad. However, a desire that ensures everyone's well-being is a good desire.\nGreat people have sung, \"pu:raya mama ka:mam\" (fill up my desires). If desires were inherently bad, they wouldn't sing such lines. Desires are judged as good or bad based on their impact on others.\nIf desire or anger were bad, they wouldn't exist in God's creation. Everything created by God is good; it is our usage that determines its value. For example, water is good, but excessive consumption can lead to harm. Similarly, anger and desire can be good or bad depending on how we use them.\nHH Chinna Jeeyar Swami emphasizes that no object in this universe is bad; it is the human mind that can misinterpret them. If one's intelligence cannot distinguish between good and bad, it can turn good things into bad and vice versa. Thus, desire and anger can be good when used wisely.\nWhen desire is fueled by anger, it becomes harmful. \"kro:dhath bhavathi sammo:haha\" (from anger arises confusion). This confusion leads to a loss of clarity and purpose. The body, soul, senses, mind, and intellect are all separate entities. If one fails to recognize this distinction, they may act in ways that degrade themselves.\nIn verse 2.63, Lord Krishna describes the downfall of those who depend solely on their efforts without understanding the greater purpose. \nLet us continue to learn more about these teachings. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "episode": 136,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), today we are discussing the teachings of the Lord regarding the downfall of an arrogant person who forgets God, thinking that he can achieve everything through his own efforts alone. This is elaborated in verses 2.62, 2.63, and 2.64. \nOne who relies solely on his own efforts is focused on worldly matters and does not care about God. He feels he does not need God. What are the dangers for such a person? The Lord begins to discuss this in verse 2.62.\nWe have two sides: on one side is the world, and on the other side is God, with us in the middle. God is permanent. Whatever He does and gives is lasting.\nOn the other side, we have prakruthi (nature). This does not remain in one form or order. It does not provide the same experience every time; it keeps changing. Therefore, whatever we gain from transient things will also be temporary. In contrast, whatever we receive from the permanent source will bring us lasting happiness. God is full of bliss. Since bliss is His nature and essence, whatever He gives will also be blissful and will never diminish, as God does not change or decrease.\nPrakruthi is always changing and moving. Even if we experience some temporary happiness from it, that too will be fleeting. We must consider which path to choose between these two: do we want temporary happiness or permanent bliss? If we desire permanent bliss, we must also endure temporary distress. \nFor example, if we want a gold medal, we must endure the falls while practicing. If one cannot bear that, he should forget about the gold medal. For those who forget about permanent bliss and chase after temporary happiness, it may not even be easy to attain that. This is what the Lord is teaching us.\nWhy? Because this is also under the Lord's control. He started with this principle:\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndhya:yatho: vishaya:n pumsaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen one thinks about the objects of the senses,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSome things are favorable to us, while others are not. However, if we want something lasting, we should choose what is favorable to that goal, not what is simply favorable to us.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nna hi adhruvahi pra:pyathe dhruvam thath\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFor what is impermanent, one cannot attain what is permanent.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe must carefully observe what we need to pursue. We should be able to choose what helps us move towards the Lord and set aside the rest. Since we are more familiar with worldly objects than with the Lord, we tend to gravitate towards these worldly objects. However, they are not permanent. When they change, we feel as if we have lost something. We do not realize that it is their nature to change. Instead, we blame others for our losses. If we feel God is accessible, we blame Him; if we find someone else, we blame them. This leads to unnecessary hatred or anger towards that person.\nWhen we feel anger, we forget our goal. It diverts us from our purpose due to these strong emotions. \nConsider a scenario: a person urgently needs to go to the bank, which closes at 2 PM. He starts driving but encounters an auto rickshaw blocking his way. Instead of going around, he honks repeatedly, but the auto driver does not move. This person could have passed on the side but chooses not to out of pride. He thinks, \"Why should I go around? The auto driver should move.\" \nHe gets out of the car and confronts the auto driver, leading to a quarrel. \nWhere was he trying to go? To the bank. However, he allowed his anger over the auto to distract him. He could have easily gone around, but his pride prevented him. Instead of reaching his destination, he ended up damaging his car and wasting time. \nWe witness such situations in our daily lives. There is often a vehicle ahead that blocks us. What is the point of being angry or cursing the driver? When the opportunity arises, we can simply pass by without engaging with them. \nWill we be able to do that? We often feel anger when someone delays us. Some people even say, \"I will take seven births to teach you a lesson.\" For something so trivial, they forget their ultimate goal and think of such extreme measures. \nHowever, when we focus on attaining and enjoying the permanent self or reaching God, we encounter many distractions. The Lord advises us, “Don’t focus on them; depend on Me completely.” This is a key point in chapter 2. If you want to conquer your senses and maintain sthitha prajnatha (steady wisdom), and if you want to reach your goal, verse 2.61 is very important to remember.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuktha asi:tha math para:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFocus on Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is crucial to depend on God. If you say, \"I won’t depend on Him; I can’t get along with Him,\" similar to the person who quarreled with the auto driver, you will spoil your body, which is the vehicle given to you, and stray from your goal. \nAssume we get angry. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nkro:da:th bhavathi sammo:haha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nFrom anger arises confusion.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe may get angry to hurt someone or protect ourselves. In doing so, we forget our goal. Once we lose sight of our goal, our buddhi (intellect) stops working towards it and begins to plan revenge. This leads to our downfall.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npranashyati\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe becomes lost.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis does not mean he will be destroyed. In Sanskrit, there is a root word, nas adarsane: nasyati - he will become invisible. He should be visible as a human, but he will not be seen as such. If he leaves his body in anger, he may take his next birth as an animal, bird, insect, or germ. \nSomeone who wishes to achieve their goal may become distracted by something else and become determined to pursue that. This is called prana:sa:m (loss of life).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnasyathi \nSLOKA MEANING -\nNot being visible.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe should be somewhere but is not present where he is supposed to be. When one lacks clarity about his goal and does not know what needs to be known, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbuddhi na:sa:th pranasyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThen he loses his goal completely.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe misses the great opportunity he has received. We have a wonderful opportunity as human beings; we have a good body, senses, thoughts, and environment. We did not acquire these because we desired them; someone (God) provided them to us. \nHe provided them for our upliftment. But if we ignore Him, what happens? \nImagine if parents placed a baby in a cradle and then left. Someone took care of that baby, fed him, raised him, educated him, and helped him find a job. But after growing up, if the child pushes the person who cared for him out of his life, how would that be? \nWe are doing something similar by living in this body and forgetting God. Without our knowledge, He provided us with this body. We did not receive this body because we desired it. We did not acquire our senses (indriya:s), mind (manas), intellect (buddhi), or knowledge (jna:na) through desire. \nWe did not desire or create the environment around us. We may have damaged some of it, which was given to us in good condition. \nDid we receive the soil, fire, water, space, air, trees, food, birds, and animals because we desired them? No! We are inviting illnesses and destroying nature knowingly. \nHowever, the one who provided all these intended them for our well-being. Recognize that all these were given by God to you as means to free yourself from bondage, and enjoy them accordingly. \nThere is no need to stop experiencing them or to abandon everything and go elsewhere. We discussed in the past what the Upanishads say: Bhunjitha:ha - experience them. \nIt is not wrong to experience them. It is your duty to understand who gave them to you, how, and why He gave them, and then to enjoy them. This is i:sa va:syam (the unseen support).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyath kinchya jagathya:m jagath\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEvery object is His.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nthe:na thyaktham kinchid asthi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe gave some to you.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbhunjitha:ha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEnjoy.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHowever, do not indulge in an unrestrained manner.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nma grudha kasya sviddhanam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhatever is not meant for you, do not try to enjoy that.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe Lord has told us this. This is stated in the Upanishads. He is present behind everything.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nmath paraha yukthaha a:si:tha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nLeave the responsibility to Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe told us in chapter 2, \"I will see how they become favorable to you. I will take care of everything. Why do you have to worry? I am capable and powerful. Ask all the Vedas and Upanishads.\" \nTherefore, leave the responsibility to Me. Out of love for you, I will ensure that everything is favorable to you. \nThe Lord clearly explained in verses 2.62 and 2.63 the dangers of not depending on Him. Let us move forward with this understanding. \nJai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), the objects which we see around us in the world have a tendency to lose their value. Whether we use them sporadically or don’t use them at all, they get old, change form, or lose their essence. However, regarding the matters of the inner world, there is no such thing as getting old. There is not much left to see or listen to about worldly objects after having seen them or heard about them once. \nHowever, we need to repeatedly listen, ‘see’, and learn about topics related to the inner world. For worldly objects, if we need to taste something a second time, it is called engili or ja:mitha do:sha (contamination). This is usually the case with all external objects. However, if we consider the subjects of the inner world, they don’t have ja:mitha do:sha. \nWhat are the subjects of the inner world? They are the ones related to manas (mind), or a:thma (soul), which makes the body work, or dai:vam (God), which makes the entire universe function. The more you listen to these topics, the fresher they sound. There is a saying [in Telugu] that if you continue eating neem leaves, they start to taste sweet. Similarly, the more you listen to these topics, the more you find a new freshness in them every time.\nHence, in the second chapter of Bhagavad Gita, the Lord said,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:scharyavath pasyathi kaschid e:na \na:scharyavath vadhathi thadaIva cha anya:ha\na:scharyavath chainam anyath sruno:thi \nsruthva:pyenam ve:da nachaiva kaschid\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSome see the soul (a:thma) as amazing, some speak of it as amazing, and others hear of it as amazing. Yet, even after hearing, no one truly knows it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nListening about the one running the inner world, a:thma (soul) or parama:thma (God), is forever fresh and new. We can never know about them entirely. Hence, we are still listening to Bhagavad Gita though it was preached approximately 6000 years ago. People have been listening to it since then. The great people who have been teaching it are trying to teach it more and more clearly. Those who have been listening to it are trying to listen more carefully. Those who have wanted to learn it are trying to learn it with more clarity. Those who wanted to put it into practice have been trying to put it into practice. Yet, the scripture hasn’t gotten old.\nNot only Bhagavad Gita, there is literature which teaches us good practices and provides us with subject matter to enhance our knowledge, like itiha:sas (recorded history), pura:na:s (legends), and traditional lore, upanishads (quintessence of Vedas), or Vedas themselves (comprehensive texts stating eternal order). There will always be many things to learn from them despite listening multiple times.\nThe second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is its whole essence. If we can understand the second chapter with clarity, it means we have understood the whole Gita sa:sthra (scripture). It can be understood through whatever topics are described in the second chapter; each of those topics is elaborated in each of the subsequent chapters starting from chapter 3. This is called vivaranam (elaboration). The chapter is known as vivarini (seed). You can think of vivarini as a seed and vivaranam as the tree that emerged from it. \nA tree has everything that the seed has, but the seed may have more aspects than the tree. That is called vivarini. What does vivaranam do? It magnifies and makes those aspects visible which remain hidden in vivarini. In fact, the tree doesn’t get any new aspects. It only has those that are already in the seed. However, we can’t ‘see’ them in the seed. Why? Because they are in a highly subtle form there. We see the trunk, bark, leaves, flowers, fragrance, nectar, and fruits in the tree. All these are in the seed. However, they are in a very subtle form. We call this vivarini. Once they emerge, we can recognize each of them separately. Hence, we term this as vivaranam.\nOur Elders, the Wise, gave a beautiful definition to it. What is it? Teaching about those aspects that reveal further knowledge about the concepts in vivarini,\nuktha ardha visadhi:ka:ra yuktha \nardha:nthara bo:dhanam matham vivaranam thathra\nmahitha:na:m manishi:na:m\nWhatever was already described in vivarini, vivaranam elaborates it with more clarity, adding more details in such a way that whatever it taught in the past [in vivarini] gets imprinted in the heart. \nuktha ardha (what was already taught) \nvisdi:karana yuktha (in order to learn it with more clarity) \nardha:nthara bo:dhanam (use different aspects for strengthening the understanding of the same topic) \nYou must not bring any new topic into the picture. This is called vivaranam.\nIn chapter 2 of Bhagavad Gita, the Lord preached to Arjuna covering all concepts, leaving nothing to be told. We have discussed them many times in the past. Let us now conclude chapter 2, taking a bird’s eye view of it. In chapter 2, Lord Sri Krishna enlightened us on many concepts. He advised that we should first learn to concentrate our buddhi (intellect) [on one goal].\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvyavasa:ya:thmika buddhihi e:ka\navyavasa:ya:thmika buddhhihi apara:\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe intellect that is focused on one goal is called vyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi (decisive intellect), while the intellect that is not focused is called avyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi (indecisive intellect).\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe said this in the beginning. Decide to attain a specific goal and to make the necessary efforts for it. An intellect with such a firm decision is called vyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi. People who don’t have this determination run behind whatever they see. Their buddhi goes behind whatever is favorable to their indriya:s (senses). \nOne person started from his home to go to his office. He met one of his friends and went with him. Then he met someone else who asked him to go somewhere else. He started for his office but did not reach his actual destination because he went with whoever he met on the way. The one who doesn’t have nischaya:thmika (decisiveness) or has avyavasa:ya:thmika (indecisiveness)…\nIn Telugu, vyavasa:ya means farming. In Sanskrit, it is different. Vyavasa:ya means nischayam (decisive). Vyavasa:ya:thmika buddhi is a decisive intellect. One should always aim for one primary goal, a single target. To attain that one goal, you can take as many means as you want. If you don’t have a goal, there are hundreds of means in the world which will take you to a hundred directions. And you will be lost. The Lord started by saying this.\nBased on how firm your intellect is, it is called chala (moving), achala (unmoving), or nischala (steady). It should be so firm that however much you disturb it, it remains unwavering. Whoever has such a firm intellect is called sthitha prajna (steady wisdom). This is a beautiful technical term. What is the person with sthitha prajna like? How does one attain this? He described the four stages in the process.\nWhat is it that stops us from being focused? What do we need to stay focused on? Arjuna asked this question. The Lord clarified that it is the indriya:s (senses) which distract the focus. Eyes keep seeing, ears keep listening, nose keeps smelling, tongue keeps tasting. The body keeps feeling different sensations. These senses encourage us to go behind them [sensory objects] saying, ‘this is very nice, this is better, attain this’. They distract our attention towards them. \nThese are prathyaksham (perceived directly). Hence they are more powerful. E:ka:gra buddhi (focused intellect) is internal and hence, less powerful [in attracting us]. What should be our goal? An unwavering mind [engrossed] in a:thma (soul) and parama:thma (God). We should attain a:thma jna:na (knowledge of the soul). It should lead us to parama:thma smarana (contemplation of God). Then, we should turn our physical activities towards that. That should be our goal. \nHowever, these indriya:s take us in all directions. In the three verses starting with, dhya:yatho: vishaya:n pumsaha sanga sthe:shupaja:ya:the… the Lord says if the mind goes behind them, then we will forget the actual goal completely.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbuddhi na:sha:th pranasyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen the intellect is lost, one perishes.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe completely forgets what he started for. He met someone in between who could be favorable or unfavorable. If favorable, he certainly wants to attain it. If unfavorable, he declares, “I’ll take as many births as needed to eliminate it! This is my goal!” He wastes many lives going behind such things. He loses his actual goal.\nArjuna got a doubt then. “Sri Krishna, it is true that such a situation exists. However, I am living amidst all these. What do I need to do to stay focused on the goal?” The Lord gave a means and an answer to this question in verse 2.61. What did He say? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuktha a:si:tha math paraha vase:hi yasysa indriya:ni\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf you want to travel on your own, it is your wish. I am not responsible for where you go. However, I can steer you as I am qualified and capable. Leave the responsibility to Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThen, there is no doubt about attaining unwavering wisdom. This is the key point in chapter 2. The essence is to submit to Him. We have heard this in the second chapter. Let’s try to internalize this. Learning it with further clarity, we must move ahead and conclude chapter 2. Let’s do that. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We are gradually proceeding forward after learning the summary of chapter 2. In chapter 2, the Lord handed us a wonderful key. We might have heard, ‘mana e:va manushya:na:m ka:ranam’ many times. Manas (mind) is the reason for a person to be reformed or degraded. If his manas is good, there is nothing that a man can’t achieve. If his manas doesn’t cooperate, even if he has many wonderful means at his disposal, he can’t achieve anything. Manas is very critical. We have heard many stories of the brave. We have also learnt about the results of the dedicated practice employed by many great personalities. Based on the firm resolve of the mind, they made great progress and attained many things.\nWe might have heard in the past of one of India’s former prime ministers, Lal Bahadur Shastri. He was wise and came from a humble background. Though he was the prime minister of a country like India, he didn’t even buy a home himself, as his only goal was to serve the country. He didn’t desire it. He didn’t even consent to a house that his children could get with his position. He didn’t consent to a promotion for his children, as he didn’t want to be known as someone who misused his position. He had a goal and purity of mind for that goal. He lived with that purity until his last breath. We have heard of many great personalities like him. The reason was the purity in their minds. It is critical to have manas (mind) in control. Indriya:s (senses) are in control of the mind. It is foolish to think we can control indriya:s by controlling the body. Because these senses are similar to a dog’s tail. As long as it is held with a stick, it looks straight. As soon as we remove it, the tail curls again. That crookedness is natural for it. However much one tries, it still reverts. The senses are also like that. Sri Krishna explained this to Arjuna in the second chapter.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvishaya: vinivarthanthe:\nnira:ha:rasya de:hinaha rasavarjyam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe senses withdraw from their objects when a person is not attached to them.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt is foolish to think ‘I will not eat to win over the tongue.’ You have kept the food away from it. The tongue has been given to work with you to take God’s names or say good words. Food gives strength to it [tongue] and you have kept that away from it. What will it do then? Desiring food, thinking about it, the tongue continues to cry for it. It doesn’t give you an opportunity to think about what you want to think [God’s names]. You can’t do anything while it is crying for it. The underlying manas is like a lenient parent which gives into kids' demands. Though the manas wants to remember thaththva (reality), because the tongue is crying, it also follows the tongue. Thus, manas loses focus on its goal. \nrasavarjyam (the imprints of the taste from the past) are in the manas too. They are strong in the indriya:s. Hence, manas goes behind indriya:s. Manas goes behind the crying ‘sense’. It could be any of the senses. We have a cover for our eyes and mouth. We can’t survive if our nose is covered. Hence, it is always open and smelling. The ear is also open like that. Our skin is also exposed from all sides. If you think you can forcibly control them by sitting in a room with all doors closed… We spoke about this in the past. There was a great person who wanted to win over his senses and sat under a tree. That resulted in the great Bha:gavatham (Bhagavata Purana). A king named Parikshith approached the person sitting under the tree. The king asked him for water. This person was in meditation, hence he couldn’t hear the king, who became enraged. The king put a snake on the sage’s neck. We don’t know if the snake was alive or dead. The king desired to take revenge and went on his way after doing so. \nAfter some time, the sage’s son reached the place. He noticed that there was a snake on his father’s neck. He wondered if a live snake which was put on his father died because of the impact of his father… Or if someone put a dead snake on his father to disturb his meditation or to insult him? What happened? Regardless, the son cursed, “whoever did this will die in 7 days after being bitten by the snake, Thakshaka!” Even that rushi’s (sage's) son had so much power. That day, when the rushi woke up to the outer world from his inner meditative state, the son came crying to him. He informed him that someone had put a snake on him [father] and that he cursed him. Since that great person does tapas (austerity), he went into meditation and saw that… it was the ruler of that country, Emperor Parikshith. \n‘When the king comes to our a:sram (hermitage), it is our duty to honor him. I didn't do it as I was in meditation. You should have done it, but you were playing outside. Both you and I didn’t do our duty. He was thirsty, hence he put it on my neck. It is not his fault. It is our fault as we couldn’t offer our services to him. What will happen to the kingdom if you curse the ruler? Hence, go right now and tell him what you did. Ask him to do whatever is required and be ready.’ The boy refused to go. The father insisted that he go as it was he who had cursed him. So, the boy went and informed the king. The king didn’t get upset. He was knowledgeable and felt remorse for what he had done. He realized he was cursed and he only had 7 days. \n‘Only 7 days! Let's enjoy the time as much as possible.’ This is how most people would think. ‘Let’s eat what we want to, see what we want to, do what we want, give inheritance to whoever has to be given.’ However, King Parikshith didn’t think like that. He thought of inviting all the wise and asking them… ‘Blessed with a human body, what is the best state to attain after leaving this body? What is it that needs to be known in these 7 days to attain that state?’ The time he had was very less, just 7 days. He invited all the wise from across the country and inquired. They might have said what they felt was appropriate. Meanwhile, Sri Suka Deva arrived. He was a 16-year-old bramhacha:ri (celibate). He didn’t even know how to tie his clothes. The assembly of rushis (sages) stood and paid their obeisances. That great person came straight to the king and took his seat. The king offered him all his respects. \n‘What should I do in these 7 days so I don’t come back into this succession of births?’ the king asked. Sri Suka Deva thought and said, ‘The great Khatwanga attained the ultimate state in one jha:mu (48 minutes). It is not a problem for you to attain that state. If you desire it, I will begin.’ The king said, ‘Please tell me.’ Suka Deva kept telling and Parikshith kept listening. The world which we see and are living in, from where and how did it come into being? How did it get this form? And in whom will it ultimately merge into? The state between srushti (creation) and pralayam (dissolution) is called sthithi (preservation). Why do these 3 happen? So the soul can get rid of its karmic bondage. There is only one who can relieve us of it and He is Na:ra:yana (the Supreme Being). All we need to do is to know about Na:ra:yana. \nOnce we know about Him, we will be freed from karmic bondage. Then we don’t need to return to this cycle of srushti and pralayam. Just know how many times Na:ra:yana brought about this srushti, sthithi, and pralayam. Know how, why, when, and for whom He did it. Though He has been effectuating it for so long, this ji:va (soul) is unable to get rid of his karmic bondage. Because he gets immersed in the senses. We just discussed that the senses are like a dog's tail which are always pulling him down. Hence, he hasn’t been able to attain it yet. No one is able to know about the Lord clearly. Hence, srushti, sthithi, and pralayam are continuing. Some great ones were able to know about God and they reached God. However, the ones who didn’t attain that stage are in multitude. For their sake, He is continuing with the creation of the universe. He [Suka Deva] preached this. \nHence, what should you do? Know about Him [Lord]. It is not so easy to know about Him. Hence know about the ones who tell you about Him. He is Bhagava:n (the Lord). Those who tell about him are Bha:gavatha:s (devotees of the Lord). Hence know about Bha:gavatha Maha:thmya (greatness of devotees). So, he delivered the preaching as a big scripture called Sri:mad Bha:gavatham in 12 cantos. Why did all this come about? ‘I will restrict my indri:ya:s!’ Someone tried to do that and it resulted in this. We should restrain the senses, yes. But we need to know how to restrain them. Sri Krishna preached this to Arjuna in Bhagavad Gita in verse 2.59. We have discussed this in the past as to how Sri Krishna did it and what He said. Let’s recollect how he did it as we conclude this chapter and go forward. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We are taking a bird’s eye view of Bhagavad Gita chapter 2. Lord Krishna indicated that one needs to attain eka:gra buddhi (focused intellect). Only then can one attain peace.\nBefore we can attain eka:gra buddhi, there is manas (mind) before the buddhi (intellect). And there are indriya:s (senses) ahead of manas. The body is further ahead of the senses. Hence, to attain eka:gra buddhi, manas has to listen to us first. For manas to listen, indriya:s have to listen. For indriya:s to listen to us, the body which is ahead of them should listen to us first.\nThe goal for our intellect is to attain self-realization and meditate upon God. Manas has to cooperate for that. However, manas has the tastes and instincts of what it experienced in the past. Therefore, manas keeps bringing them up and our attention goes towards them. Before that, there are indriya:s that are habituated to some things. Whatever they are habituated to, they try to attain them.\nHence, what should be done? Should we restrain them forcibly or use them in an appropriate way? What is good? This was the question. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI bow repeatedly to the Lord who removes all obstacles and bestows all wealth.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKrishna asked, \"What is good in your opinion?\" Arjuna replied, \"I will restrain them.\" Krishna responded, \"It is not possible for you. Why? Whatever tastes and instincts pop up to the top of the manas, our intellect thinks about them. If we are offering flowers to God or meditating in our home temple, and we smell something from the kitchen, our thoughts go towards that. Similarly, our manas starts thinking about whatever instincts and tastes pop up from inside them and… indriya:s will try to experience them and the body also goes in that direction.\"\nHence, it is very important to clean the manas first. Is that in your control? If you don’t want to see, you close your eyes. If you don’t want to listen, you can close your ears by putting something in the ears. If you don’t want to smell, you can practice holding it for some time. If you don’t want to eat, you can close your mouth. If you don’t want the body to do anything, you can tie it up and put it in a corner. What can you do to manas? God didn’t give covers like eyelids to manas. It is meant to be free. And it doesn’t stay still even for a moment.\nWe see sparrows flying. They are never still. They fly from one place to another, up, down. Manas is even more on the move. It can’t exist without doing something. Its nature is to be active. As it is always active, we have to somehow engage it. Restraining it is not in our hands. We have to constantly engage the mind. Hence, what should we do? If we say, ‘we will keep the objects away’ - our goal is not keeping the objects away. Our goal is self-realization and contemplation of God. Use it (mind) for that goal. How do we use it?\nKrishna asked, \"Are you going to make efforts to use it?\" Arjuna replied, \"I should be the one doing it.\" Krishna said, \"If you think you are the doer, it won’t listen to you. Instead of making yourself responsible, put the responsibility on someone who is capable. Put it in the hands of someone who has previously conquered it.\" \nArjuna responded, \"To do that, I need to pay fees to them, right? Also, they have to be with me when I need them. Without knowing how long they will be with me… once they leave, if my manas wanders, then what should I do?\" Krishna replied, \"True. That’s why instead of putting it in someone's hands, put it in the hands of a capable one like me. Put it in my hands.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntha:ni sarva:ni samyamya yuktha a:si:tha math paraha vase:hi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBy controlling all the senses, one should sit focused on Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKrishna continued, \"If you put it in my hands, I will make sure it is in your control. Do you have faith that I am the capable one?\" Arjuna answered, \"Yes, I do.\" Krishna said, \"Then put it in my hands. How much salary should I give you?\" \n\"I don’t need any salary. How much salary does a mother need to bring up her child? If you appoint a nanny, then you have to pay her salary. In spite of that, she may not come if she has work at her home. However, I am not going to go anywhere. I am always going to be with you and within you. Also, I am capable. I am all-powerful and all-knowledgeable. The phrase math paraha (in my hands) carries great power.\"\nFirstly, I am easily accessible to you. Secondly, I am attractive and capable. In Srimad Bhagavatam, a discussion ensues between Sage Kapila and his mother Devahuthi, at the end of the third canto. How to control mind and senses? He explains this in great detail to his mother. In the 28th chapter, he begins from verse 21, 22 onwards, how one needs to do it and the practice needed.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsanchintha ye:th bhagavathascharana:ravindam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWe have to think of God’s lotus feet.\n-----------------------------------------------\nKapila teaches, \"How are they?\" \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvajra dwaja:nkusha saro:ruha la:nchana:dyam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere are many beautiful marks on His feet. Each mark depicts one of His many different capabilities.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"We have to take shelter of the feet with those marks. How are they?\" \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nutthunga raktha vilasan nakha chakra va:la jyothsna:bhihi a:ha:ha mahath hrudaya:ndhaka:ram\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe glow of the beautiful pink toenails, which are on the beautiful toes of the Lord, is so powerful that it drives away all the darkness in the heart.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"The toenails of the Lord are like beams of light which can drive away all that darkness. However, getting rid of darkness is not our only goal. Our goal is to remember God, not just keep the objects away. Because it (darkness) is the blocker, it should be eradicated. However, afterwards, if we don’t get that (contemplation about God), then whatever practice you did to get rid of (darkness) will be a waste.\"\nKapila preaches very wonderfully about the power of the Lord’s feet and what they do after they get rid of it (darkness).\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyath soucha nissrutha sarith pravaro:dha:ke:na\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHis feet are the source of the river Ganges.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"It is said that rivers flow from Sahya mountains. Similarly…\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsoucha nissrutha sarith pravara uda:ke:na\nSLOKA MEANING -\nDo you know what the holy water which flows from His feet does?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"The purity which it bestows to this world can’t be bestowed by anything else. What happens with that?\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:thi:rthe:na mu:rdhni adhikruthe:na sivaha sivo:bhu:th\nSLOKA MEANING -\nBrahma’s son is called Rudra. Because he received this holy water on his head, he was called Siva instead of Rudra.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"He became auspicious to the whole world. All his defects were removed and he became sanctified.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npa:do:dhuke na sa sivaha siro:dhruthe:na\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhat does the holy water off His feet do?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"Whoever remembers and keeps the Lord’s feet in their heart, the different sailas (mountains) of sins in their manas (mind) are not in single digits, or in dozens or thousands. They are in zillions or trillions. They are the size of mountains. The glow of His feet and the jewel marks on His feet have the power to destroy these huge mountains.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndhya:thuhu manasya mala saila nissrushta vajram\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is the diamond which ‘cuts through’ the mountain.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"For that reason, we have to constantly meditate on the Lord’s lotus feet. It does two things. First, it removes what needs to be removed from inside. It then fills it (manas) with that, with which it can attain the best state. It takes out what is not necessary and gives what is necessary.\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ndhya:ye:th chiram bhagavatha scharana:ravindam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHis lotus feet are capable of bestowing both.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"Hence, I am yours. You don’t need to give me any fees for it or submit any specific application for it. I am always with you. Hence…\"\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuktha a:si:tha math paraha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nStay with Me. Keep Me in your heart. Leave your responsibility to Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"I will teach you which direction the body should work. I will tell you how the senses must act to behave properly. Since the nature of manas is to keep moving, I will make sure it moves properly. I will take you to the destination which you should reach. Hence, remember that I am important. Let go of the ego that can make this work on your own.\"\nThis is the message which Krishna gave to Arjuna. Arjuna is listening to that. What do you achieve with that?\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsa sa:nthi ma:pno:thi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe attains mental peace with that.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\"Lord explained this in the last two verses of chapter 2.

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Everyone desires peace of mind. In spite of great wealth, without peace of mind, one is unable to enjoy it. In spite of many comforts, if that peace is missing, then none of it feels good. One needs that peace of mind. We live in this world surrounded by many objects. Should we experience them or not? When we live amidst them, how can we avoid their ‘touch’? When immersed in water, it’s silly not to expect getting wet. Thus, we have to ‘see’ and experience what we are surrounded with. However, we should not be a slave to them. Instead, they should be in our control. To enlighten us of this, Bhagavan (Lord) Krishna in chapter 2 says…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pada:m apahartha:ram da:tha:ram sarva sampada:m\nlo:ka:bhi ra:mam sri:ra:mam bhu:yo: bhu:yo: nama:myaham\nSLOKA MEANING -\nI bow repeatedly to the Lord who removes all obstacles and bestows all wealth.\n-----------------------------------------------\n“Put the onus on Me and live peacefully!” If one is able to place the responsibility on Me, then I will ensure he has a stable mind. I will ensure his knowledge transforms to prajna (righteous wisdom). I will ensure that the righteous knowledge remains stable, i.e., sthitha prajnatha (steady wisdom). The Lord then also alludes to a few examples. Earlier, we discussed that change must happen in your mind, not in the surrounding objects. If your mind is pure, then everything will transform to become right. If your mind is disturbed instead, nothing will be of use. Our mind is always considered a prasarana si:lam (nature of expansion) or pravrutti si:lam (nature of activity); it always engages in activity. Therefore, we must always assign it some work.\nFor example, a crying kid must be given an interesting activity to engage him. But today’s moms are handing out a mobile phone simply to stop the child from crying. The kid is getting introduced to a mobile phone when he is just a few months old! If someone asks, ‘Why are you giving him that? He will be spoiled with it.” They would say, “TECHNOLOGY. The children have to be introduced to the technology!” “Because the world is now run by technology. It's better he gets used to it early.” True, but what will he learn at this age? Just the video games on the phone. If you delay giving him the phone even by a few seconds, the child will throw big tantrums. Is that what we are supposed to do? We should teach him an activity that enhances his life in the future and makes the world a better place. Instead, we want to get him off bothering us or annoying us. So, we resort to getting him habituated to and giving him something that spoils him and makes him run after it. Can we blame him then? Our mind is similar to the child’s. Not giving the mind something that’s beneficial to it is our mistake. It is not the mistake of the mind that drifts constantly to various thoughts. It has to ‘go’ somewhere, so it does. If you try to stem the flow of a river with a barricade, it will either break it and flow onwards or it will flow over such barricades, but it will not stop there. Therefore, we have a duty to guide the river onto an appropriate outlet. Similarly, we have a duty to guide the mind towards an ‘outlet’ that is appropriate and engaging. It will not go on any path you ask it to take.\nIf you ask a little child to go and sit by a stranger, he won’t obey. He will only approach the one who he is acquainted and familiar with. He is familiar with his mom. Even if she punishes him, he chooses to go to her. He will, however, not entertain a neighbor wanting to hold him. If his mom is not around, he will choose to go to either a familiar sister or a brother or an uncle. He feels comfortable going to someone he is familiar with but will not choose anyone that he is not acquainted with. There is a need to make him familiar with more acquaintances. Similarly, we must introduce God to our mind! As God is great, we must introduce Him first to our mind. Initially, during introductions, our mind feels uncomfortable, but we must persist.\nEarlier in Srirangam, there were many great teachers who gave lessons. There were also many preachers who gave discourses. Nambillai is regarded as one of those erudite scholars. He is one of the great scholars from the lineage of Ramanujacharya. One of Ramanujacharya’s disciples is the great Parasara Bhattar. Nanjiyaar is his disciple. And Nambillai is the disciple of Nanjiyaar. There is a pushkarini (temple water tank) in Srirangam known as Chandra Pushkarini. A ponna tree stood on its shore. From under its shade, Nambillai used to give pravachans (discourses). He would give discourse on Bhagavad Vishayam (God as experienced by Nammalwar). On the north side of the temple, there is a large open area. Many would throng in that area to listen to his teachings. It was in those days, approximately 800-900 years ago. At that time, not many had heard about Bhagavad Vishayam or Alwars’ Prabandhas (sacred texts). After hearing Nambillai’s discourses on these, everyone started enjoying them thoroughly.\nSrirangam’s temple priests decorate Lord Rangana:tha exquisitely. To give people a chance to enjoy the sight of the beautifully adorned Rangana:tha, the Lord is taken around the prime streets circumferencing the temple. This is done as part of Thiruvidhi Uthsavam (divine procession). The procession is carried out every day for one or another reason. Many used to visit the temple daily just to see this. However, after Nambillai began to give pravachans, devotees started coming for the talks rather than to see Lord Rangana:tha. The teachings continued. Devotees gradually got attracted to these. Their interest grew to such a level that even when the Lord would emerge during the yatra (procession)… Generally, when the Lord approaches, everyone stands in reverence, similar to when elders come by. When the Lord Himself, in Whose premises they were in, is out and about, people are supposed to quickly get up and bow to Him, wait until that yatra moves out of sight, and continue their activity afterward. The deity of Lord Rangana:tha, when taken around the temple for seva (service), is known as selvar. When the deity is in the area, everyone must stand up and show respect. Also, the pravachan must be paused until the Lord leaves the area.\nThe audience of these pravachans felt that… In those days, pravachans were known as kalakshepam. The current usage of “kalakshepam” is different from those days. We think it means to do something to kill time. An activity to pass time or kill time. But the word did not form to convey that. It is made up of kala (Lord Yama) and kshepam (to drive him far away). What’s manifesting there [Nambillai’s teachings] is a state that drives Yama away. What is that? Apparently, Yama is scared of only One. Yama is not scared of Brahma or Rudra (Shiva) or any other gods. Even they are scared of Yama as well. This was mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam. However, Yama is scared of only One; who is that? He is scared of the One who is known by Omkara (the sound of Om).\nThere is a part of the Veda known as Katha Upanishad. It describes the history of a boy named Nachiketas. In that, Yama Himself gives a discourse to this boy. The boy asks Yama,\nYe:yaṃ pre:the: vichikithsa: manuṣhye:\nasthi:thye:ke na:yamasthi:thi chaike |\netdad vidya:m anushiṣṭhas thvaya: ahaṃ \n“Hey Great One! Many in this world have differing opinions about one’s existence after leaving the current body. I am a proof that one exists after the current body is shed. I came all the way here to you after shedding the body. So a jiva (soul) can exist without a body. However, does the soul exist after breaking the bond with karma (imprints from a soul’s past)? Will such a soul then stop existing? I have many such questions; You must clarify those for me.” Yama answers him in various ways. We do not want to go into that history now. However, Yama’s response contains the following. “I also have a Lord who creates, sustains, and recycles all the worlds. He is the One who swallows and holds the entire Universe in Him. The ultimate reality is the knowledge of Him, who is known with the sound of Om.” He summarized it that way. He named it as attha (one who consumes). It’s not the Telugu word attha (aunt), but a Sanskrit word. Attha means one who ‘consumes’.\nYasya brahmacha kshatramcha ubhe: bhavatha o:danaha\nMruthyuhu yasya upase:chanam\n[Yama says] “The moving and non-moving material beings of this Universe is the Lord’s o:danam (food).” To consume food, there needs to be something on the side… like a chutney, a curry, or lentils or sambar (a type of lentil soup). Isn’t it? [Yama says] “I am the one whom He uses as sides. I am mruthyuhu (death). Mruthyuhu yasya upase:chanam. The Lord uses me as a side to mix along with the rest and consumes. It is Him that the sound of Om defines. You need to know about this. Om explains in what way and how a jiva (soul) exists and what he does after disassociating with karma and reuniting with God. Therefore… The One who oversees even the devata (deity) of death is Lord Narayana who is the controller of the universe. [Sri Krishna says] That Lord Narayana is Me. Leave responsibility on Me. I exist in you as well. I am the one who can guide your mind in the right direction. Train your mind to dwell on Me.\nIn chapter 2, Bhagavan (Lord) gave this amazing solution, like a key…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nyuktha a:si:tha mathparaha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf you are engaged in Me, you will be steady.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf you habituate your mind towards destructive things, then it will tread only that path, immersing your senses in them. But if you train the mind about Me or teach it to learn My qualities or introduce it to Me, then it will incrementally act towards knowing Me. Only then will your senses settle down. You are not restricting your senses now; instead, you are guiding them. You are not limiting your mind, just showing it the right path. Where are you leading them? Towards Me! This is a wonderful tool. In Vaishnava tradition, this [practice] is deemed as a wonderful means. Temples give an opportunity to perform divine services to God. Use all your senses. Early morning in the temples after harathi (aarti) to God, they serve hot pongal (a rice dish), curd rice, bitter tamarind rice, sweet milk rice, or sweet pongal. They serve everyone with various delicacies there. Since you have a habit of eating, you should eat, but take it as prasad (food first offered to God). Do not just consume it as any food that satiates your hunger. You should train the senses in how an activity must be carried out. While providing the senses activities in which they are accustomed to, similar to how an effective medicine is embedded in a capsule, if you train them properly, I will ensure that they lead you properly towards the desired goal. Only then will your mind be at peace. Lord Krishna clarified in Chapter 2 that the tool to calm the mind can only be obtained when it is surrendered to God. He explained it adding further clarity in the last 2 verses, which we will learn next. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In Chapter 2, Bhagava:n (Lord) shared a beautiful analogy of how a human should lead life. The ocean! It teaches us a very important lesson. Lord explains to us what it teaches about. What is it? Thousands of rivers perpetually flow into the ocean from various directions and merge into it. But the ocean never crosses its limits and flows over.\nWe know that the percentage of water on the earth is higher than that of land. While the land comprises around 27%, water is spread around 73%. If any water body overflows, then this 27% of land mass would be totally submerged. But does that ever happen? Our irresponsible conduct results in small typhoons, etc. Thus, there is a certain intensity of pressure on the land occasionally. If an extremely forceful wave hits, imagine the plight of that 27% landmass on earth. But that is not happening anywhere.\nWe must learn something from this phenomenon. What is it? No one knows how much water from many rivers flows into the ocean, perpetually. To fill a large water tank, we run the water pump motor for several hours to fill it up. Then we stop the engine once the tank gets full. Do the rivers only flow into the ocean similarly, for just a few hours per day? No. Or do they dump water for only so many days or months? No. They send huge amounts of water into the ocean 24x7, non-stop.\nThis happens on one hand. On the other hand, the Sun with its rays is continuously evaporating from the ocean all the time. We do not know if the inflow and outflow are proportional or not. But we know that this process is happening perennially. We imagine… the ocean never overflows (from inflow of river water) nor shrinks due to the sun’s evaporation. We imagine that it is because these inflow and outflow are probably proportional. Whether this is accurate or not, we don’t know. Why?\nThe inflows are usually water. Sometimes it’s pure water and sometimes it’s impure. A portion of water coming in from rivers is probably pure. Fascinatingly, no matter the amount of river water inflow, the ocean will not change its characteristics. It simply merges. It will alter the qualities of the inflowing water and make that consistent with its existing nature. Afterward, water from rivers like Ganga (Ganges), Sarayu, Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri, Tungabhadra, or Penna will not be known by their river names. Once merged, the ocean water has a quality of being salty. Any water from any river with any color or quality will be transformed into ocean water. The ocean will ensure that its quality is imbibed by any water inflow, but not the other way around.\n[Sri Krishna says to Arjuna] You must learn this. The mind is like an ocean. This ocean must be filled with wisdom. What type of wisdom? The knowledge of thaththva (reality), that is the cause for your presence here. That knowledge is what we should aspire for, isn’t it? Anything without this knowledge is useless. Imagine a person working in an office. He needs to have knowledge related to that office work. If he has other knowledge that cannot be applied to this work, then he is not qualified to be there. He is not just disqualified but he can turn out to be dangerous to that office.\nSo, depending on which department he works for, he must possess appropriate knowledge as long as he works there. It is immaterial what knowledge he will possess once he leaves that work. It is also immaterial what knowledge he had before joining this office. He may have knowledge of his home, relatives, or knowledge related to various other things. Fine. He arrives at his office at 9:30 am and leaves work at 5:30 pm. During that period, he is expected to use only knowledge of work, nothing else. This is a fact we know.\nFor everyone, the ‘office’ is the world we live in. We arrived in this ‘office’ the moment we were born. We will leave this ‘office’ when we take our last breath. So what should we have, as long as we are in this ‘office’? Who had arranged all of this for us? How and why was this arranged? What is your responsibility in all this? As long as we are in this ‘office’, we must have this know-how. We are incapable of finding out on our own who the root cause is behind all this. So, we are extricating that detail from the scriptures. We are asking the Ve:das (Vedas).\nVedas told us that all of this is bestowed to us by Na:ra:yana (Lord Vishnu). Na:ra:yanaha Param Bramha (Narayana is the Supreme Absolute). This was told clearly by scriptures, ve:da:s, itiha:sa:s (historical texts), pura:na:s (ancient texts). Therefore, we must learn about Him! Without knowing Him, learning about anything else is futile. So we must be made aware of Him and fill our mind with this. This is the ‘water’ that it (ocean of mind) should be filled with. The knowledge of a soul's thaththva (reality) which realizes God. The knowledge of a soul's thaththva that contemplates upon God. This is what the mind must be full with.\nWhen we live here, ‘rivers’ are flowing in [to the mind’s ‘ocean’]. Eyes are open, various visible forms are a type of ‘river’ that is flowing in. Ears are open, various audible sounds are a type of ‘river’ that is flowing in. Tastes, odors, touch are all different types of ‘rivers’ flowing in. Yes. Many such rivers from the external world are making their way into our mind. After coming in, they should not influence us. Whatever indwelling ‘water’ you have, the external ‘rivers’ should merge with it. Your ‘water’ should not alter its characteristics to suit the incoming water. That is why Bhagava:n used the ocean as an example.\nOnce the river water merges with the ocean, that water is also called ocean water then. No matter what river it is, its water automatically acquires the ocean’s color and taste. Even if you pour a bucket of milk into the ocean, it will only become ocean water. It won’t stay as milk. The bucket is just an example. It doesn't matter what quantity of milk we pour in, all that will turn into ocean water. As you pour, you may see it as milk for that moment but very quickly it turns into ocean water. This is why He [Sri Krishna] gave this example.\nWhen you are here, it’s ok to enjoy them. He did deny this. That is why He gave the example of the ocean. Should rivers be allowed to flow into the ocean? Today, we apply ‘intelligence’ and build dams everywhere blocking rivers due to inter-state politics. The water is not allowed to flow into neighboring states nor into the ocean thereafter. We want all the water [in our state]. What happens then? When there is a deluge, all the villages around are flooded. Then the leaders realize. They repent. ‘We built these unnecessarily. Perhaps we should have let the rivers naturally flow.’ This doesn’t occur often however, only on occasion. Any state that built excessive dams has experienced this already, and will continue to do so. You are inhibiting natural behavior.\nRivers must flow. Similarly, the mind must experience sensory objects. Eyes must see, ears must listen. Same with taste and odors. All these must happen. He did not ask to stop these. In verse 2.70, He said…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\na:pu:ryama:nam achala prathishttam samudram …\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe ocean that is constantly filling and stable.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSensory experiences are streaming in, 'waters' are flowing in continuously, so the senses must be at work continuously. See things, but ensure they don’t disturb your mind. Hear things, but do not let them affect your mind. Sometimes after seeing some things our mind is constantly distracted by them, imagining them continuously. When we hear something, we get immersed, ignoring our duties. When a tuning fork is hit, it resonates and a humming sound echoes continuously. Similarly, the mind constantly dwells on something we see or hear, completely ignoring the intended goal of action. This should not happen!\nYou should not be driven by them. They must come into the mind, let that happen. This is one view of the metaphor. A second view – Water is evaporating from the ocean, isn’t it? Similarly, after you experience some things, some flow out as well. You cannot stop them either. The influx and outflow will need to happen. You should not be affected by them. Whoever can keep their mind stable in such a way… only he can…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsa sa:nthim a:pno:thi na ka:ma ka:mi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOnly that person attains peace who is not driven by desires.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIf the waters of [material] knowledge spill out, it’s dangerous. When ocean water outflows, it drowns villages. It should not happen that way. Ocean and land should maintain their states. For us to recognize this, [Sri Krishna says]…\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\n… sa sa:nthim a:pnothi …\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOnly that person, into whom sensory experiences enter in this manner, attains peace.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSri Ra:ma (Rama) is therefore cited as an example. In Ra:ma:yana (Ramayana), speaking of Ra:ma it was said,\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\n…samudra iva ga:mbhi:rye:…\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHis mind has the depth of an ocean.\n-----------------------------------------------\nRa:ma never stopped doing His duty. He never refrained from any of his prescribed duties. While in the palace, He ruled the kingdom. In the forest, He helped its inhabitants. In Lanka, He fulfilled His duty there. Near the ocean, He carried out His actions there. He was never inactive. He always did His duty without causing any harm to Himself or others around Him. He stayed steady. This is needed for every human. This is the quality one must strive to achieve.\n[Sri Krishna] gave the example of the ocean to teach how one must be tranquil while experiencing things. If this behavior persists, then one will have no qualms to let go of them [worldly experiences]. Worldly things are experienced to make them favorable to that [knowledge of God], not just to experience them. The reason we allow the water to flow into the ocean is because they won’t pollute the ocean. Imagine if that new waters were to kill whales, prawns, fishes, etc. Similar to the devastation caused by the oil spilled by Arab countries causing black clouds. If the water inflow caused such damage, then it must be restricted.\nTherefore, He gave the ocean as an example when one is experiencing materialistic things. How can one keep one’s mind stable and lead a peaceful life? What is it like when that [experience of materialistic things] is given up? Sri Krishna ends chapter 2 with the last 2 verses discussing this. Let’s try to understand that. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "episode": 142,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), In Chapter 2, Sri Krishna advised how one can attain control of one’s mind. There are two ways one can try to achieve this. First - by one’s own effort. Second - by delegating it to someone capable of achieving it for us.\nIn a court, we must present arguments ourselves. If we are incapable of arguing, we delegate this to a capable lawyer. He will then argue on our behalf. Actually, the defendant against whom the case is registered should argue. If he is able to, he should argue for himself. But we are usually not well-versed in law, unaware of the processes, how to handle questions and objections, and logical propositions. Hence, we select a person who is well-educated and experienced, and delegate the case to him. We designate him to argue on our behalf. But the first right to argue our case rests with us. This delegation can be done.\nOn external matters, such an option (i.e., delegation to others) is possible to an extent. There are some folks we know who can argue without the need for a lawyer in a court of law. Whether it is the case he filed or the case filed against him, in both scenarios he can argue for himself in front of a judge. As long as he can operate within guidelines, the judge will also allow this. There are people like this.\nSince common folk do not have this option and are not familiar with law, they delegate this responsibility to someone. Now, if you consider the matters of life, God is the one who gave this human body and the world it exists in. He is also the indweller. If He is known, then everything is known. However, the chance to learn about Him is very limited. The senses and mind pull us towards many external sensory objects in many directions. Imagine the state of a rider in a chariot where the horses pull in various directions uncontrollably; our state sitting in this body is similar to that of this rider. We must therefore submit it in the hands of the One who has the strength and the capability to bring all the senses in and carefully direct them.\nSri Krishna hence said in Chapter 2.61 verse, ‘I can drive them. Keep them in My purview.’\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntha:ni sarva:ni samyamya\nyuktha a:si:tha mathparaha |\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIf the person we entrust our senses to is careful, we will be happy. But He is not careless! He feels the same or at times, even more joy and pain than us. We therefore do not need to worry about it. He must feel that our pain is His. Also, He should not snatch happiness from us. Some folks do lip service saying, ‘I will treat your happy and sad times as mine!’ ‘I will give my difficulties to you and will enjoy your happy outcomes.’ What benefit is there for us having such a person around? We need someone who can alleviate our difficulties and who can bring happiness into our life. Don’t we benefit from such a person? God possesses such a quality.\nHe demonstrated this many times during His avata:ra:s (incarnations). In the Ramayana, between Vali and Sugriva, Rama befriended Sugriva. History taught us this. Kabandha had already advised Him to befriend Sugriva. Many wonder why Rama did not befriend Vali directly, but chose Sugriva instead. Vali is the reigning king. There are many benefits to having Vali as a friend. Ravana would listen to him. Rama’s task would have become easy. Instead of making acquaintance with him, why did Rama choose to befriend this nomad, useless one that wanders around hills and mountains? Many quickly doubt this choice. Even Vali wondered about it.\nAfter Rama struck Vali down, Rama went to see him. Vali confronted him. Vali said, ‘Hey Rama! Being son of Dasaratha and descendant of Ikshvaku, I thought you would be an intelligent one. Being a disciple of sage Vasishta, I thought you are well-educated. I did not expect you to be this ignorant.’ Rama asked what happened. Vali said, ‘I am very powerful. I held Ravana under my arms and dragged him through seven seas. Yet You killed me and approached my weak brother. You killed me to strengthen your relationship with him. How smart are You? What is your thought process? Is this intelligence?’\nIf a country needs to establish relations with others, which country should it begin with? If a small country needs to build relationships with various bigger countries, which one should it choose? It is beneficial to choose a country that is developing at a faster pace, is technologically advanced, and is well-endowed. It should not opt to partner with a country that is struggling to take care of itself. This is common sense. Forget how our country is managing its affairs. India in earlier days befriended Russia instead of America. Now, our leaders elevated the country where it can operate on its own. We are fortunate in that sense. Let’s leave that aside.\nVali said, ‘You fought me to befriend him.’ In fact, Rama did not know who Vali or Sugriva were. Earlier, at the time of killing the demon Kabandha, a Gandharva (celestial singer) appeared from him. He said, ‘Rama, there is a great one called Sugriva wandering around with his four ministers in the nearby mountains. He lost his kingdom. He is, however, capable of providing support in your search for Sita. Befriend him.’ Rama did not know these people until Kabandha spoke of them. When Rama did the final rites of Kabandha, a Gandharva appeared from it, spoke this, and left. That’s all Rama knew then. He therefore traveled and befriended Sugriva.\nWhen Sugriva requested Rama to kill his enemy Vali, He obliged.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:kam dukham sukham cha nau\nSLOKA MEANING -\n‘From this moment on, when we pledged to be friends with the fire deity as witness… From this moment on we shall endeavor to share good and bad times together.’ So He does not do anything that displeases Sugriva. He would help him out of his difficulty and provide things that make Sugriva happy. That’s all Rama knew. So He decided to do the same. Therefore when Sugriva said, ‘Hey Rama, Vali is my enemy and must be killed’, Rama obliged.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsugri:va vachana:th \nva:lim jagha:na\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSo He killed Vali. Later an interesting act happened. Sugriva has some human traits. Despite being a monkey, he possessed more human traits than that of a monkey. Since he didn’t like Vali, he had him killed. After Vali fell, he wept sitting next to him, ‘O! Brother, we lost you!’ He began shedding crocodile tears then. Sugriva was indeed shedding crocodile tears! But for Rama, he is His friend. Seeing Sugriva sad, Rama was truly heartbroken.\nSays Valmiki, \n…sanja:tha bha:shpaha paravi:ra hantha:\nHaving considered one as His friend, irrespective of the friend’s true intent, He [Rama] treated His friend’s sorrows and happiness as His own. While Sugriva was feigning sorrow, Rama really shed tears! Rama became, \n…sanja:tha bha:shpaha…\nThis is the nature of God. Whether it is as Rama, Krishna, Varaha, Narasimha, as a fish or another form or as a Kurma (tortoise), whichever avata:r He is in, His nature doesn’t change. There will be no change in His natural behavior. What is His natural behavior? Act according to your intent. To transform Himself to suit your needs so He can elevate you. To extricate someone who fell into a well, one must descend into it and help him. If this person [savior] falls into the well and onto the victim, he would hurt him further. So the savior should not be the one who falls into the well along with you; instead, he should be able to prop you up. God who is with us all the time is the One who can elevate us. He listens to us and takes us to a higher level.\nTherefore He [Sri Krishna] advised us to put the burden on Him. He also declared what He would do in that case. What will He do? ‘I will ensure that the constant inflow of sense objects does not disturb your stable state of mind.’ ‘I will ensure your state is not disturbed by various experiences encountered.’ He mentioned this with the example of the ocean. Later in verse 71, He explains by taking us to a higher level. Not just when experiencing materialistic things, but even when they are kept at bay, He said He will make sure that the mind’s tranquility is not affected. He mentions this in verse 71.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nviha:ya ka:ma:n yas sarva:n\npuma:ms charathi nispruhaha |\nnirmamaha nirahamka:raha\nsa sa:nthim adhigachhathi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nHe will certainly attain a stable state. How? nirmamaha nirahamka:raha I will ensure he is not bogged down by mamatha (feeling of ownership) that could damage him. ‘I will make sure he is not affected by pride.’ So will he still be dealing with materialistic aspects of life? Yes, he will.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npuma:ms charathi nispruhaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nSpruha (attachment) indicates, ‘I will make sure that he will not cling to anything and get carried away by constantly brooding on it.’ Eat. Only when you need to, but do not brood over its attractiveness, taste, its form, and whereabouts while ignoring other things. This is called Spruha. A school-going child who has education as his primary goal will not think about what he is eating or drinking. Whatever his mom offers, he takes it. He eats because he has to and continues to study. A guru’s disciple once asked the guru’s wife, ‘Mother! Why did you put castor oil in today’s food?’ She responded, ‘Today’s food is the same as that served daily. Your focus was on your education and you were not bothered about what was served.’ ‘Now that your focus has shifted from education to food, it must be time to go home because your study time is over.’ This [food] is necessary. However, if you go behind it, it is called spruha. Senses must function without this spruha.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\npuma:ms charathi nispruhaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen this soul moves among everything, but free from attachment. What happens then? viha:ya ka:ma:n Anything that he experiences will not affect him in any way …sa:nthim adhigachhathi he will then have a tranquil mind. Let’s progress to learn how one attains this.

It is very important to observe the wonderful terms He used. He didn’t suggest you give up eating but He advises you to learn how and what to ingest. He didn’t suggest you close your eyes but He advises you to learn how to perceive things when you see them. He didn’t suggest you don’t listen but He advises you to learn what is worth listening to.\nWe were taught in childhood… vinadagunu evvaru cheppina, vininanthane ve:gupadaka… Listen, but do not get carried away by everything that you hear. Reflect on it. Does it make sense or not? Is this method right or wrong? We must direct it [whatever you hear] in a way that helps us in attaining our goal. We must leave the responsibility of enabling us to mold in the hands of God. We should use them [what we hear] towards reaching God.\nPedda Jeeyar Swamiji used to say always… “The nature of mind is to wander. Don’t stop it.” “If you want to control thoughts, don’t restrict them. Let them flow.” How will the mind listen to us when it is on the go? “Do the following” Please enlighten us. “You are worshiping, trying to perform dhya:na (meditation). What distracts you?” A sweet shop that sells jile:bi (a type of Indian sweet).\n“Good, then just relish that thought.” But, I will lose the track of meditation, won’t I? “No, happily enjoy that thought. What do you do when you remember the jile:bis?” I generally blame the mind for thinking about jile:bi and try to drag it away. “Don’t do that.” “If you do that, your mind will make extra efforts to go closer to the same.” Then, what should we do? “Let it go.” Then, wouldn’t it simply feed on it? “No, it won’t.” “Because earlier the jile:bi came to your mind as an object of your pleasure or your mind perceived it that way.” “Now, you will direct it as an offering to Sri Krishna.” “Jile:bi, how yummy! Let’s offer to Sri Krishna.”\nYou did not ask the mind to not look at jile:bi because it is looking at it. You asked the mind to look at jile:bi as an offering to Krishna because it is diverting you from the goal. Now, it [the mind] understands what your need is. And it also looks at what it desires. Now, because the jile:bis are intended for offering to Krishna, prepare larger jile:bis! The ones made and offered to the Lord in Sri Rangam are very large, as big as two hands. Round, shining like gold, juicy, crispy on the outside, soft inside! You are giving your mind better jile:bis, those which the mind doesn’t even know of. However, you are telling it that they are being made as an offering to Krishna.\nIs it now wrong for the mind to think of jile:bis? Is it wrong for it to see jile:bi? It’s not desiring the jile:bi for itself anymore. If it is thought of as an offering to Krishna! This is just an example. Whatever you think of, this is how it must be thought about. Whatever it is you are thinking of, whatever it is! There is nothing in this world that does not belong to God. Therefore, it doesn't matter what your mind thinks of. No need to be scared. You need not get upset when your mind is wandering on various different things or ways.\nIt is our limitation for not being able to establish a connection between the desired object and Krishna. We must learn in what way each thing belongs to Krishna. If it [mind] reaches a beachfront, and is seated on a shore watching the waters, it’s okay. Bring Sri Krishna along to the shore. Seat him there. Show its beauty [to the mind] with Krishna sitting next to it. How beautiful is the bund (embankment), the beautiful plants and flowers along its way. How wonderful is the water, the waves and the breeze. What’s wrong with this? You are not at loss if your mind is wandering there in this way. It is in fact useful.\nThis is stated in the Upanishads… yadha: sakunihi su:thre:na prabadhhaha disam disam prabadathi Imagine the mind to be a bird. A bird is beautiful to look at when it flies. One can watch the beauty of the wings. However, if you let it go in order to watch its beauty, it will not be in your hands. It will go away from you. It must be in your control yet be able to watch its wings. What should we do? su:thre:na prabadhhaha It must be tied to a strong supporting stem with a string that doesn’t break even upon trying hard. If it’s a long string, tie it to its leg and let it go. It happily flies like a kite to the extent it is allowed by the string holding it. You can thus watch the beauty of its wings. You can also retract it whenever you feel it’s enough and position it where you want to.\nThis is what you must do to our manas (mind). Therefore, we must not forget the word mathparaha (one who is devoted to God) used in verse 2.61, even in verse 2.71. If we make God as the strong support, then the desires will become desires for God. Therefore, vishayas (objects of sense) are not bad. It’s the desire for those vishayas that is bad.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nviha:ya ka:ma:n yas sarva:n\nSLOKA MEANING -\nPut away all the desires from your mind that you think are for you.\n-----------------------------------------------\nInculcate the bha:vana (mood), that ‘these belong to God and therefore they are for God.’ Now… puma:n charathi nispruhaha One will have spruha (longing) for something when you think of it as meant for you. You will not feel for something if you think it’s not yours and not for you. Now… charathi (moving) Senses are moving. Charathi is an amazing word in Sanskrit. chara gathi bhakshanayo:ho There are two meanings for it. Charathi means to eat/experience. Charathi means to move away or be gone. Both meanings can be used.\nDisregard (charathi) the desire for the objects. Yascharathi, whoever is experiencing (charathi)... Both are happening: experiencing and pushing away. Because it is the quality of the senses to work, they work. However, you must make sure not to get attached to objects. When learning the stages of sthittha prajnatha (focused state), we discussed the example of Jadabharatha. It was the 2nd stage of mental steadfastness. Jadabharatha would eat when someone offered him something. If nothing was given, he wouldn’t eat. Even if he ate, he didn’t ‘know’ what it was.\nPalanquin bearers asked him to support it on one of the four sides and walk. He walked because he was asked to. That’s all. Because someone placed it on his shoulder and it was on him, he carried it and walked. He didn’t have any relation with what it was, the way to carry it, and the way to walk when carrying it. charathi (he is moving [along with the objects]) However, he is charathi (distanced) and thereby undistracted by any of the experiences related to those objects. Why is he able to do this? Jadabharatha does not have the spruha (feeling) that he is the body. It is a means formed for me for a temporary period. He has the belief and is certain about being the atma (soul) within, in union with God.\nWhen traveling by road in a car, the car comes into contact with the dirt, stones, etc. There is no need for the traveler to have any relation with them. There is also sunlight, rainwater, and air from above and around. The car comes into contact with them, but you as the one sitting inside the car need not care about them. You know that the car is different from you. Similarly, the physical body is a car. We are dwelling in it. Our goal is God. When this car is traveling, it has to move in the way it needs to, along one of the paths that it has access to. Jadabharatha is in this state. We must also attain this.\nWe must continue to work as long as we live in this world. A great man is currently ruling this nation. He does pay mind to other things. What he must do is to run all the areas in the most efficient way to the extent of his abilities. Because he is not attached to them, it seems he sleeps peacefully at the end of his day. It seems he also wakes up peacefully and resumes his responsibilities 100 percent. He will do so until his term is complete.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnisspruhaha\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe reason is nirmamaha (unattached) nirahanka:raha (without arrogance).\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhile in power, it is okay to hold office. Yet, when their term is over, certain elected officials don’t want to relinquish that authority. They did not become nirmama (unattached) from it. They want to be there. They are entwined with attachment for it. Because they feel they belong there. They have durahankara (presumptuousness). They are not nirahanka:ra (without arrogance). It was appropriate for them to live there when they were in power. Let’s say one of them is some minister like the Minister of Agriculture or some other ministry. It is the place designated for the Minister, not for him. When he is not the minister, how can it be his?\n“I have been here all this while. How can I leave this?!” You are not in that position now. Then, why that official residence? There are so many such buildings in Delhi. There are probably such buildings in many places. We don’t know. This [body] is a place of residence given to you. It is not you. It is an abode given to you. As long as allocated for you, you should live here. Afterward, what relation do you have with it? However, we don’t accept this. We feel… We feel “this [body] is me - everything related to it is mine; I should be the one sustaining it all.”\nTherefore, ahanka:ra (false identification with the body) and mamatha (false ownership) trouble people. When your attachment reduces (nirmamaha), you should also cut down ahantha (ego) (nirahanka:raha). When these two are subdued, then spruha (urge for them) decreases. It is then that his ‘experiences’ stop becoming desires.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nviha:ya ka:ma:n yas sarva:n puma:ms charathi nispruhaha |\nnirmamo: nirahamka:raha sa sa:nthim adhigachhathi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOnly then will he have attained a steady and stable mental state. He will then be able to live in peace.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThis happens when he recognizes the Self within. Sri Krishna explained this in verse 2.71 while nearly concluding chapter 2. Let’s learn how. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), We have come to the last verse of chapter 2. Sri Krishna is speaking verse 2.72 to Arjuna.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:sha: bra:mhi: sthithih pa:rttha! naina:m pra:pya vimuhyathi | sthithva:: sya:m anthaka:le::pi bramha nirva:nam ruchchathi ||\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is the state of a realized and resolved mind, Arjuna! One who attains it will never be confused or ignorant. Even if one reaches this state at the last moment of life, they will attain the highest happiness.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWonderful verse. Arjuna, this is a wonderful state of realized and resolved mind. This is the state one must attain. What happens when one attains this? There will never be moham (ignorance) or confusion; that is, he will never be blocked anymore.\nWhen the sky is really cloudy, we can’t see the Sun from where we stand on the ground. It becomes dark. If we fly up to a certain height past some clouds, we see that there are some more of them. If we fly up a bit higher, we see that the space is occupied by white clouds. Fly up still higher, like 30,000, 35,000, or 40,000 feet, i.e., 40 km upwards from the ground level. There is no question of any clouds up there, no matter what kind of clouds. All kinds of clouds are below that level; they don’t cross that level.\nArjuna! If one attains the brahmic state (brahmhi sthithi) that I stated, there is nothing that will envelope him making him ignorant. How does one practice for this state? When should the practice begin? To be honest, it must begin at birth. The purpose of one’s birth is actually to attain this state. In fact, we have been given this body as a means to attain it. We forgot the purpose of the body and are not aware of it. We are under the belief that the purpose of the body is to nurture it, or others, or to attain something else. We are thus abusing and misusing it. We are using it in various wrong ways. The ultimate goal for getting it is to attain brahmic state.\nI am not questioning you on what you did all this while. Even if you have roamed around [away from this] all this while, if you can attain this state at least before your last breath, you will definitely attain the highest happiness (brahmha nirva:nam).\nHe stated so. In the earlier two verses, He instructs us to keep distant from the vishayas (worldly objects) that we experience in this world. Or even if you are with the vishayas, He explained how to redirect them. He explained both states. One is vishaya durikaran (keeping away from experiences of worldly objects). Secondly, even if we are experiencing them, He explained the process or the way one should experience them. Why? Our mind should not get disturbed. This is what we are desiring.\nWhat is that which distracts it? The feeling that this body is you. This feeling distracts it. If we must show who we are, we identify ourselves as our bodies. Because we identify ourselves as our bodies, we prefer things that are necessary to the body. Whatever is difficult for the body, we try to push them away. Bitter gourd is, in fact, good for the body. Do you know? However, how many people like eating bitter gourd? No one. Because it’s bitter. In fact, bitter and astringent foods are healthy for the body. However, we don’t like both those tastes.\nIn fact, all the vitamins and other essentials that are not available through other means are available in bitter and astringent foods. These days, people are speaking of strengthening immunity. It seems they help in building immunity like nothing else does. However, we like everything else but not these. We don’t even want to go near them. Why do we not go near them? Because the body doesn’t like it despite it being healthy. The body dislikes them, not we.\nWhat are we doing here? We are obeying the one who is a servitor and overlooking the owner himself. How ‘wise’ are we! If necessary, we should actually be keeping aside the servant to obey the owner. However, we are behaving in the opposite manner. We are cooperating with the servant and losing the owner. What it means is that we are placing our very existence at stake. This body is a servant given to us. We should make sure it listens to us; we shouldn’t be driven by its words.\nWe talked about an example earlier. It seems a woman employed someone to help her in work. Remember this? The maid laid some conditions. What are they? She needs coffee as soon as she comes in. She needs a break after having coffee to begin work. She will work only for two hours. The woman employed her anyway because there will be some help. Before she arrives, the employer has to make preparations to give her coffee. She has to get milk. She has to wash the coffee pot. The woman employed her to wash all the utensils. Usually, she used to wake up in the morning around 6 or 7 am. Now, she has to wake up early, around 4 am, to go to the milk booth. She has to wash the required vessels beforehand. She wakes up at 4 am, hurries to the milk booth, makes coffee, and keeps the glass ready. As soon as the maid arrives, she offers it to her, addressing her as ‘Madam..’ After the maid drinks coffee sitting happily with her legs crossed, she takes a break. Then, she sweeps the floor, pushing the dust from the corners to the center and moving the dirt in this corner to that corner, etc. By then, it’s about 2 hours, and she will leave the broom there and say, “I will take leave now.” The woman would have to clean her home again. She (the maid) would leave her coffee glass too unwashed. The woman will need to wash the glass. Did she employ her for helping her, or is it the other way around?\nIn fact, if you retrospect carefully, all our lives are in the same boat. The body is given to us to do our work. However, we are not of that opinion. We think it is our goal to do work for the body. We utilize our knowledge, intellect, energy, and logic only to nurture the body, satiate the body, and take care of its needs. We are not utilizing the body for our sake. What do we call this? Deha-atma bhranti (believing that you are the body). This is very dangerous. In fact, you should come out of it. Because of deha-atma bhranti, you think that those related to this body are your relatives. You feel that you should do something for them. Therefore, there is a rise of mamata (a feeling of ‘mine’). Because you are in the belief that the body is you, there is a sense of ahamkara (ego) towards it. A feeling of 'mine' begins to build towards those related to the body. Therefore, attachment and ego! What are they doing? There is an urge to acquire everything related to them. A desire to earn various things. They do not get satisfied despite earning and feeding them a lot. To feed them more and more, one begins to earn more.\nWe are witnessing today how people are earning lakhs and crores of rupees. After all that, all he can eat is the usual bit. He doesn't even have time to eat that. There are phone calls in between, visitors, appointments, and answering queries. His entire life is spent this way. He doesn’t have time to even sleep properly. What is the purpose of all these efforts? It is to satisfy the relatives of the body. Ahamkara and mamata, satisfying those related to the body. To satisfy them, he earns. To earn, he works. Is this why we got the body? No. However, this is what it has resulted in. What is happening because of this? He has zero peace of mind. Zero! He lives in a posh building, has a big bank balance, many assistants, position, and power. What’s the use? There is no peace of mind.\nHence, the first thing is to come out of the deha-atma bhranti. It gives rise to ahamkara and mamata. If it dissolves, ahamkara and mamata also will shed. Only when they are shed, we will want to use things with care. The desire to acquire/attain objects will decline. Such desire creates mental turmoil. When it declines, the turmoil in mind also comes down to an extent. That brings peace to mind. Only when he attains the state of mental peace, there is a chance to realize his state. What he experiences then is called brahmha nirva:na (real happiness). Swami is explaining that this is how you should attain it.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:sha: bra:mhi: sthithih\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThis is what you must attain.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhat is the root cause [for not attaining it]? It is deha-atma bhranti. When that is cleared, ahamkara and mamata retreat. When they are retreated, the sense of desire to acquire objects comes down. This is a process. This is what was explained in verse 2.71. If you can attain it and come out of this deha-atma bhranti, we now believe this body is real and everything. We all know that no matter how much you do for it, the destination is dry wood or the earth. At times, we don’t even know what happens to it. In the COVID times, the situation was such that we couldn’t even see what happened to the bodies. We are all aware of that. Therefore, should you be running behind this or the one who brought you here? Think about this. This is what He said.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:sha: bra:mhi: sthithih pa:rttha!\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThe state where you believe in and are dedicated to the underlying reality…\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe state when you are utilizing the body for that [underlying reality]… When you attain such a state, that is called brahmic state (brahmhi sthithi). That is when you will never again become ignorant or confused. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnaina:m pra:pya vimuhyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhen can one attain it? \n-----------------------------------------------\nWhenever it happens before you lose this life, it’s fine. Even if you attain it at the last breath, it’s good. You will attain the final limit of happiness (brahmha nirva:nam). We don’t know what happiness is. The Vedas must define what happiness is. It did. In chapter 2, Lord Sri Krishna is guaranteeing that we will attain it. Let us learn a little bit about what it is and move ahead to the next chapter. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), Everyone desires a:nanda (happiness). Irrespective of nationality, race, religion, age, status, position, or educational qualification, every single person desires something called happiness. \nWhat is happiness? The feeling that ‘this is favorable for me’ is defined as happiness. What is sorrow? The feeling that ‘I don’t like this, it is not favorable for me’ is defined as sorrow. We refer to happiness as that feeling or a state of mind that something is favorable for one. Everyone desires happiness. All activities are aimed at happiness. It is for happiness that one accrues knowledge or any possessions. \nHow much happiness does one want? It must be the greatest. There is nothing wrong in desiring it. One desires the greatest happiness. When you offer two different fruits to a little baby, he chooses the bigger one. Whatever is ‘big’, everyone desires that. Whatever position is the highest, people desire that. Whatever gives greater wealth, people desire that. Whatever is the most spacious home, people desire that. Whatever is the highest position, people desire that. Everyone desires whatever is greatest.\n*HH’s words | It is a nice thing. You are eligible for attaining it, desiring it, and you can definitely attain it too. However, if you can understand and desire what is the best and the greatest... Bhagavad Gita gives you the opportunity to attain it. That happiness is named bramha:nanda (the best and the greatest happiness). Bramha is the name given to that which is greater than everything. Bramha means that which is bruhath (the biggest) in the world and outside the world. Therefore, whatever is the greatest happiness of all is called bramha:nanda.\nHowever, what is the use if it is the greatest? It should also make us great. Whatever can make that happen is in fact called bramha. bruhathi brumhayathi ithi bramha (that which is the greatest and that which makes the one who reaches it, also equally great). \nWhat do we desire? Like a magnet that gives the iron piece which reaches it, its power and transforms it also into a magnet, we desire that which can take us to the greatest state of happiness. That is called bramha a:nanda. This is also called bramha nirva:na (the state of ultimate bliss). bramha nirva:nam ruchchathi (you are definitely attaining/experiencing it). \nWe must observe how Krishna uses the word and conveys it beautifully. ruchchathi, this is in present continuous tense. It’s not ‘attained’, or ‘will attain’. He says ‘attaining’ it. It is in present continuous tense. He revealed wonderful meaning by using the present tense this way. \nThe last verse of chapter 2, verse 72.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nbra:mha nirva:na mruchchathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nIt is declaring that we will definitely attain bramha:nanda.\n-----------------------------------------------\nGod is promising that He will give it to us. He will give us that which is the greatest and that which will elevate us to becoming the greatest. There are some hurdles for it. What are those hurdles within us? They are the hurdles in the manas (mind). There are no hurdles externally. One is lack of belief, a doubt. Is it true? Does it happen? Our life is full of doubts. We took birth with them and we are also growing with them. We will also die along with them. Our whole life is filled with doubts. These are the primary dangerous hurdles.\nFirstly, you need certainty. You will certainly attain it. He will surely give it to you. You need conviction on this. Secondly, you must clean the dust from your manas. What is the dust? One is inability to recognize Him. Second is ignorance of who you are. Third is believing that you are the body. Fourth is believing that whatever are the needs of the body are your own. \nWhen you are traveling in a car, the needs of the car are not your needs. What you need is food, water, sleep, etc. What the car needs is gas, diesel, lubricants, etc. It has its own needs. Its needs are not your needs. Your needs are different from the needs of the car. Shouldn’t we understand this difference? Similarly, the needs of the body and the soul are different. You must know what both are. You must give priority to the soul’s needs and address the needs of the body only to the essential extent. If you give it beyond its needs, it will overpower you. We must know this. \nTherefore, the body is a very dangerous tool. It is not appropriate to restrain it from its needs completely because it is a tool. We must take the responsibility of nourishing it as needed, only to the extent that is needed. However, what happens is that various other kinds of dirt keep accumulating on it. We talked about this in the past. Like vishaya spruha (desire for sensory objects), keeps accumulating on it. These must be washed out regularly. Don’t we regularly wash the car that we use? Don’t we keep it clean? We must also wash this ‘car’. \nHowever, we only know how to clean the external body but are incapable of cleaning the inside. Generally, we can clean something if the dirt is removed. But how can we clean the inside? The ‘water’ that can clean the vishaya va:sana (imprints of objects of pleasure) is supplied by God. Some places cannot be cleaned by regular water. It requires hard water. There are separate factories that make heavy water. Some jobs get done only if such heavy water is used. \nPower is produced by extracting energy from Uranium pellets. Not thermal energy, but where power is generated from water. In such a case, very high energy is released from them (uranium pellets) after they are squeezed. To control that radiation, there is something called heavy water. The split uranium pellets are dropped in the heavy water. It controls the emissions from them. As long as they are in that heavy water, the emissions are controlled. Regular water cannot be used for this purpose. \nSimilarly, what ‘water’ can clean the dirt accumulated in various ways in the body? That ('water') is Bhagavad Gita. This is what the Wise and the Sages who experienced it have declared.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsakruth gi:tha:mbhasi sna:nam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nUsing the waters of teaching given by Sri Krishna, we must clean the inside.\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe must listen to the teachings, we must comprehend them. Using that, we must clean ourselves. What can it do? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsamsa:ra mala mo:chanam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nA collective name for all the types of inner dirt is samsa:ra (worldly existence).\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe think samsa:ra is the name for the people surrounding us, the home, the wealth, etc. All this is not samsa:ra. That’s not true. It is the feeling you have towards them. That is called samsa:ra. If your home is bad, you should get rid of it. However, do we do that? If relatives are bad, we may kill them all one after another. However, it is not the correct thing to do. It’s not the objects or people that are bad. However, it is the feeling you have towards them that can go wrong. \nWhy will it go wrong? It goes wrong because of ahanka:ra (ego) and mamaka:ra (the thought of 'This is mine'). The reason for those is the spruha (desire) that grows internally. This is called samsa:ra. That [feeling in the mind] must go, not necessarily these [objects, wealth, relatives, etc.]. It is also called ra:ga (attachment). If ra:ga is steered in the right direction, then a gruha (home) becomes a thapo:vana (place of spiritual practice). If ra:ga does not leave you, \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nvane:pi do:sha: prabhavanthi ra:gina:m\nSLOKA MEANING -\nThere’s no point; even a peaceful forest can become burdensome.\n-----------------------------------------------\nTherefore, it is the inner cleansing that must happen. It is in the state of mind that cleanliness must happen. What is the water that must wash it away? \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsakruth gi:tha:mbhasi sna:nam\nSLOKA MEANING -\nTry to clean your mind with the ‘waters’ of Gita.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt will clean the dirt resulting from ahanka:ra and enable the rise of saththva guna (goodness). You will then know your swaru:pa (inherent nature). This allows you to turn your focus towards a:nanda. It will make you reach the best state of a:nanda. It will bestow you with bramha:nanda, the best and the greatest kind of joy. \nbramha nirva:nam ruchchathi (When will this happen?) It happens when bra:mhi: sthithi (a state of realized and resolved mind) is attained. It is given that [bra:mhi: sthithi] name. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ne:sha: bra:mhi: sthithih pa:rttha!\nSLOKA MEANING -\nWhat happens when one attains this?\n-----------------------------------------------\nAnything attained can be lost again, isn’t it? One may lose anything else, but not this inner state [of mind]. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nnainam pra:pya vimuhyathi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nOnce attained, there is no way that it will revert.\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt remains stable forever. So, when must you reach this state internally? It’s okay to reach it whenever you can, before you lose this life. It is good to do the right thing anytime. It’s better to chant the name of Narayana at least before your last breath, isn’t it? \nLet’s say you have talked about all different things in life. However, if you chant the name of Narayana in your last moments, it will still yield a better state. If one does so from the beginning or for the most part of one’s life, we need not clarify what state he would attain. Therefore… \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsthithva: sya:m anthaka:le:pi\nSLOKA MEANING -\nEven if you attain this state at least at the end of your life,\n-----------------------------------------------\nbramha nirva:nam ruchchathi (you will experience the best and the greatest state of joy). That is, he will attain a state that never gets destroyed. This is a great upade:sa (message) by Sri Krishna in chapter 2. His wish is that we all attain this state. The rest of the 16 chapters in Bhagavad Gita are the elaboration of chapter 2. Whatever topics are taught in this chapter are individually elaborated in the rest of the chapters. Let’s try to learn them gradually. Jai Srimannarayana!"

    "chapter": 2,
    "episode": 146,
    "content": "Jai Srimannarayana! Priya Bhagavadbandhus (Dear devotees of the Lord), The first chapter of Bhagavad Gita is about the sorrow experienced by Arjuna. It became a means and showed the path for his betterment. He was not alone; there were two others who were also in sorrow: Dhritharashtra and Duryodhana. However, their sorrow did not lead to their improvement; instead, it became a means for their destruction. Therefore, their sorrow was put aside.\nArjuna’s sorrow not only provided a beneficial teaching for him but also offered us a wonderful way of life for the benefit of the whole world. Thus, sorrow also became a means. So:ka (sorrow) turned into a means of giving us Sri Krishna’s teaching in the form of slokas (verses). Thus, it became Arjuna Vishaada Yoga (Arjuna’s sorrow as a means). That was the first chapter of Bhagavad Gita. It served as an introduction.\nWhat is the context? Where, how, and why did Gita Upadesa (the teaching of the Gita) take shape? We understood this background in that chapter. Till verse 2.12, it described how Arjuna’s sorrow continued and transformed. In the first chapter, Arjuna felt bad for everyone in the war, such as the soldiers and relatives, who would all go through pain, difficulties, and loss of life, leaving their families in sorrow. He felt deeply sad that he would attain the sin of killing everyone. This was in chapter 1.\nIn the first 10 verses of chapter 2, that sorrow gradually shifts focus from everyone towards two people: Bhishma and Drona, his grandfather and guru. His sorrow worsened thinking about having to kill them. These slokas [2.1 to 2.11] are also part of the sorrow phase. Thus, chapter 1 and the beginning 10 verses of chapter 2 formed an introduction for Bhagavad Gita. It served as a means. It was then that Sri Krishna began to teach.\nFrom chapter 2, verse 12, He began introducing Tattva (reality) as a teaching. It continued till chapter 18, verse 66, which is the last verse of the teaching. There are a few more verses after 18.66, which are all concluding verses. However, chapter 18, verse 66 is the last verse of the teaching that had to be given.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\nsarva dharma:n parithyajya…\nSLOKA MEANING -\nAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThat is why that verse is called Gita Charama Sloka (the final verse of the Gita). The Upadesa (teaching) concluded at that verse. It began at 2.12 and concluded at 18.66. The content between these two is called Bhagavad Gita and is the essence. Chapter 2 has 72 slokas, and the teaching began at 2.12. That means, 60 slokas of the scripture progressed in between. All of this [60 verses] provided an answer to Arjuna’s reluctance to wage war. It addressed his feeling that begging for alms is better than the ‘happiness’ that killing everyone brings.\nIt enlightened him that fulfilling duty is essential despite any difficulties or happiness, whether easy or painful. It prepared him for it. It stated that a focused mind is important. It gave him confidence that God will always be around to support him with what is necessary for that. The second chapter continues to instill trust in him that it will also give him real happiness. Chapter 2 concludes with verse 72. He taught whatever he wanted to say in these 60 slokas. Bhagavad Gita has a total of 700 slokas divided into 18 chapters.\nThese 18 chapters are divided into 3 sections, with 6 sequential chapters in each. A section with 6 chapters is called Shatkam (section of six). The first Shatkam, second Shatkam, and third Shatkam. The topics He delivered in chapter 2 are elaborated in three Shatkas. In chapter 2, He instructed that one should fulfill one’s duties. To fulfill the duty, one needs a focused intellect. To have focus, one’s Manas (mind) needs to be clean. When Manas is clean, the senses will not run in various directions. He said He will extend support on this.\nHe taught a few topics here. One is the senses and the work done through them. To do the work, one needs knowledge. It is called Jnana (knowledge). Therefore, Jnana should be there. So, one must work with Jnana. While working, one must enhance Jnana further. You must now work with such enhanced Jnana. You must work knowing how it must be done. One must never leave the practice through which one is enhancing the knowledge. He says He will support it.\nWe should know who He is. We should know what He is like. We should know what He will do. We should know how much He will do. We should know what our relation with Him is. We should know how He can be useful if one knows Him. All these are internally embedded aspects. In chapter 2, He taught the Atma Tattva (reality of the soul) and the way one must do his work. Atma Tattva is named Sankhya (knowledge of the soul). If one knows the way to do his work, it is called Yoga (path). Sankhya and Yoga. Jnana and Karma (action). He taught these two in chapter 2.\nHe needed to elaborate on these two. Therefore, chapter 3 emerged to elaborate on how to do that, which is termed as Karma Yoga (the path of action). To work, one must know what the means are. We must know how to get hold of the means. If one wants to record a video, one must know how the camera functions. One needs to know the functionality of each button, how it can be started and stopped. One needs to know where to focus the shooting. One needs to know the requirements for it. This is knowledge.\nJust because one has knowledge doesn’t mean he can simply sit there. He needs to know how to apply the knowledge. The interesting thing is that one initially needs to work, and he needs knowledge for that. He should work with knowledge. He will need to gain an understanding of that work. The video recording work shouldn’t end at recording. He should know who it should be played for, why the video is to be played, etc. This is all again knowledge. Jnana (knowledge) is only a single term, but it has various levels. There are levels in knowledge such as: primary, intermediate, final, mature, and highly matured. All these have an effect on Karma (work).\nSo, there is knowledge involved prior to, during, and post Karma. Jnana is only a two-letter word, but its span is limitless. Chapter 3 is the knowledge of the way of working. In chapter 2, whatever work He instructed to be done is called Karma. If one knows how to do it, it is Yoga. It is called Karma Yoga, chapter 3. The work that needs to be done has to be backed by knowledge. This is chapter 4, Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge), which describes work backed by knowledge in detail.\nWhen working, backed by that knowledge, we cannot have a distracted mind. It should listen to whatever is being told. Therefore, it needs to be controlled. Chapter 6 has come into the picture to elaborate on how to control the mind. It is named Atma Samyama Yoga (the path of self-control). It had to be taught separately as a chapter. The mind needs practice to follow the instructions. Chapter 5 discusses Karma Sannyasa Yoga (the path of renunciation). It talks about what it means by doing Karma while renouncing it, where and for whom it must be renounced.\nChapter 6, Atma Samyama Yoga, talks about the means for achieving it. All this is the first Shatka. There is nothing new in the rest of the chapters. Discussion and analysis of the pre and post details of concepts in chapter 2 gave rise to 4 chapters. \n-----------------------------------------------\nSLOKA WORD -\ntha:ni sarva:ni samyamya yuktha a:si:tha mathparaha… | 2.62\nSLOKA MEANING -\nControlling all the senses, one should sit focused on Me.\n-----------------------------------------------\nHe then explains what ‘Me’ is in chapter 7, Jnana Vijnana Yoga (the path of knowledge and wisdom). There are basic and advanced levels of knowledge about Him. Chapter 7 elaborates on this. After knowing who He is, it was essential to give the knowledge of how He gives everything, each of different kinds. There are so many types of people in the world. He explained what and how He gives to different types of people and the means to them. This is explained in chapter 8, Akshara Parabrahma Yoga (the path of the imperishable absolute).\nWhen Arjuna felt overwhelmed about all this and felt like he couldn’t do all of it, He clarifies that the means for this is love. I am not here to trouble you. If you really have love, you will be able to receive everything I give you. He explains Bhakti (devotion) as the main means. Because Bhakti needs to be carefully understood and used, it is named Raja Vidya Raja Guhya Yoga (the royal knowledge and the royal secret). The Bhakti Tattva (principle of devotion) is explained in chapter 9.\n“Really, is that so? Are you that great?” [Arjuna] “What do I tell you about My greatness?” [Sri Krishna] Listen, He says in chapter 10, Vibhuti Vistara Yoga (the path of divine glories). “If You are that great, can I see You?” [Arjuna] “Sure” [Krishna]. That is demonstrated in chapter 11, Viswa Rupa Sandarsana Yoga (the path of the vision of the universal form). Arjuna felt ‘dizzy’ with that vision. “Don’t worry, I am very easy to attain” [Sri Krishna]. He explains how easy devotion is in chapter 12, Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion).\nAll these 6 chapters are describing the word He used to refer to Himself [math] in 2.61. To elaborate on His Swarupa (form) and how it is so easy to be devoted to Him. These 6 chapters are the second Shatka. After explaining all this and after Arjuna has ‘seen’ His form in his Manas (mind) and begun to trust in Him out of fear, to clarify it all further, He summarized almost 10 chapters of content beginning from chapter 13, Kshetra Kshetrajna Vibhaga Yoga (the path of the field and the knower of the field).\nHe explained how that happens by elaborating on the three Gunas (qualities) in chapter 14, Guna Traya Vibhaga Yoga (the path of the division of the three Gunas). He explained the cause for this, His Tattva (reality) in Purushottama Prapti Yoga (the path of attaining the supreme person), chapter 15. He explained why they occur in Daivasura Sampad Vibhaga Yoga (the path of the division between the divine and the demonic), chapter 16. He explained the reason for it to be Sraddha Traya (three types of faith) in us, chapter 17. \nThe benefit one attains by leaving the burden to Him and surrendering to Him, knowing all of these, is explained in chapter 18, Moksha Sannyasa Yoga (the path of liberation and renunciation). This is the elaboration of chapter 2. These [6 chapters] form the third Shatka. This is the comprehensive form of Bhagavad Gita. If we can understand this and move forward, we will attain clarity. Let’s move ahead, Jai Srimannarayana!"
